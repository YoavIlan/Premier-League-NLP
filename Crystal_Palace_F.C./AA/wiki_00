Julián Speroni

Julián Maria Speroni (; born 18 May 1979) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Crystal Palace.

Having begun his career at Platense, he played three seasons in the Scottish Premier League with Dundee before joining Crystal Palace for £750,000 in 2004. He has played 400 matches across all competitions for his current club.

Speroni was born in Buenos Aires. He started his career with Club Atlético Platense, in his homeland, but moved after just one year as a professional and two matches, to Scottish side Dundee. Dundee manager Ivano Bonetti received advice from an Italian contact to Speroni's potential. The move to Dundee was delayed for two months, due to administration delays in Argentina, holding up Speroni's application for an Italian passport.

He signed for Crystal Palace, newly promoted to the Premier League, on 13 July 2004, for a fee of around £750,000. Speroni made his debut for Palace against Everton in a three goals to one defeat. Speroni only started the first six games for his newly promoted team in their Premier League campaign, before he was replaced by Hungarian international Gábor Király.

His first three seasons at Selhurst Park saw him largely play understudy to Király who made the goalkeeping spot his own. This was until the Hungarian departed Selhurst Park at the end of the 2006–07 season. Back in the line-up Speroni flourished and won his reputation back. Palace managed to reach the play-offs with Speroni earning a new three-year contract at the end of the 2007–08 season and the club's "Player of the Year" award. At the end of the following season, he retained Palace's "Player of the Year" award.

In the 2009–10 season, Speroni again drew praise. Like at Dundee, his club fell into financial difficulty, and finished the season in administration. This meant a ten-point deduction, and survival was only secured on the final day of the season. For his role in this, Speroni was given a new record, becoming the first man to win Palace's "Player of the Year" award for three consecutive years. Then on 10 December 2010, Speroni agreed a 3 1⁄2 year extension to his current contract.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Speroni was named Player of the Year for the fourth time. His contract expired early into 2014 and he subsequently negotiated contract offers with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom. On 13 June 2014 Crystal Palace announced that Speroni had signed a new contract with the club for 12 months with a further 12 month option. Speroni is much loved by the Crystal Palace fans and has become a cult hero at the club being named the supporters' player of the season on four separate occasions.

Speroni was rewarded for his years of service to Crystal Palace with a Testimonial match against Dundee on 26 May 2015. Speroni made his 347th league appearance for the club, breaking John Jackson's record as the team's goalkeeper with the most league appearances, against Arsenal on 21 February 2015.

In March 2015, prior to the testimonial, Speroni was inducted into the Dundee Hall of Fame picking up the International Award which was previously won by fellow countryman Claudio Caniggia.

On 22 May 2015, Speroni signed a one-year contract extension at Crystal Palace to keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2015–16 season. He was dropped to third-choice goalkeeper in that season, behind Wayne Hennessey and Alex McCarthy, but still played 2 league games, including the league match against Southampton F.C. in the final day of the season, when he equaled John Jackson’s club appearance record as a goalkeeper in all competitions. He signed another one-year contract extension on 13 June 2016 to remain with the club until the end of 2016–17 season. On 14 October 2017 he was named a starter in Palace's match day squad again, helping them to a 2–1 win over defending champions Chelsea.

In November 1998, Speroni was named in the squad for a friendly against Japan U20 in Tokyo. In December 1998, he was called into the Argentina U20 pre-selection squad for the 1999 South American U-20 Championship, Argentina's under 20 team played friendlies against Hungary and Denmark. On 30 December José Pékerman did not name him in the final squad.

Speroni made one appearance for the Argentina U20 team.

Speroni also holds an Italian passport, for which he qualified through his grandfather.

Speroni owned a restaurant in Purley, south London that was named 'Speroni's.' The restaurant closed in October 2016 following "structural issues" 

Speroni is also on the board of reference for Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), an organisation working for religious freedom through advocacy and human rights.

He began his professional career at Chelsea, where he was used sparingly, spending time on loan at five other clubs. He joined Sunderland for around £1.5 million in 2014 and was transferred to Crystal Palace in January 2017, for a fee rising to £14 million.

Van Aanholt represented the Netherlands at numerous youth levels before making his full international debut in 2013.

Van Aanholt was born in 's-Hertogenbosch to parents from Curaçao. He is the cousin of fellow Dutch international Leroy Fer, who currently plays for Swansea City.

Van Aanholt joined Chelsea's youth ranks in 2007, making his professional debut while on loan at Coventry City on 9 August 2009 in a 2–1 Football League Championship win over Ipswich Town. He was later recalled to Chelsea in December due to the exit of many players due to the African Nations Cup.

Van Aanholt was first selected for Chelsea in an FA Cup tie away to Preston North End in the 2009–10 edition of the Cup, wearing the squad number 52, but did not make an appearance, remaining on the bench. He made his Chelsea debut on 24 March 2010 in a 0–5 away win at Portsmouth, replacing Yuri Zhirkov at left-back after 71 minutes. He then made his home debut, on 27 March 2010, against Aston Villa in a 7–1 victory, again as a substitute. On 29 January 2010, Van Aanholt joined Newcastle United on a one-month loan deal after regular left back José Enrique suffered an injury.

Van Aanholt made his first appearance for the Eagles in a 2–0 win at Bournemouth on 31 January. His home debut, a 0–4 loss to former club Sunderland at Selhurst Park, came four days later.

On 25 February 2017, Van Aanholt scored his first goal for Crystal Palace; the only goal of a 1–0 victory against relegation rivals Middlesbrough.

On 19 November 2013, Van Aanholt won his first senior cap for the Netherlands in a friendly match against Colombia, coming on in injury time for Memphis Depay in a 0–0 draw at the Amsterdam Arena.

Scott Dann

Scott Dann (born 14 February 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Premier League club Crystal Palace. He began his Football League career with Walsall, before moving on to Coventry City and then to Birmingham City in 2009. After Birmingham's relegation from the Premier League, Dann joined Blackburn in August 2011 and was the club's captain.

Dann was born in Liverpool, Merseyside, and attended Archbishop Beck High School in the Walton district of the city. He is a former Liverpool F.C. season ticket holder.

Dann joined Walsall in 2003 as a junior after impressing on trial at the Bescot Stadium, signing a professional contract with the Saddlers the following year. He moved up the ranks at Walsall to become a regular in the reserve team throughout 2004–05 and was allowed to join Danish side Køge BK on loan towards the end of the campaign.

Dann then joined Conference North side Redditch United on loan in October 2005 initially until the end of the season, but he was recalled in January 2006. He then Joined Redditch's league rivals Hednesford Town on loan following injuries to their regular centre-backs Richard Teesdale and Ian Wright. He played in three games for the Pitmen, against Hucknall Town, Stafford Rangers and Lancaster City, before injury put an end to his loan spell at Keys Park. He returned to Walsall and was put on a short-term contract for the 2006–07 season, where he earned his place in the starting line-up with a number of excellent performances at the back. His season was ended in March 2007 after picking up a metatarsal injury in the game against Milton Keynes Dons.

As reward for his outstanding season for the Saddlers, who were promoted as League Two Champions, Dann was given a three-year contract to commit him to the club and to ward off interest from a number of clubs higher up in the league.

His form in League One was equally as impressive as the previous season, so it was little surprise that in January 2008 Dann joined Coventry City for an undisclosed fee, suggested in the media to be "in excess of £1 million". His impressive form for the Saddlers continued in the Championship for the Sky Blues alongside former Walsall teammate Daniel Fox, who had also moved to the Ricoh Arena. He helped the club narrowly avoid relegation. The England set-up had seen enough in Dann and Fox to decide they were ready to make the step up to international level, with both players making their U-21 debuts in March 2008 against Poland at Molineux.

Dann was appointed captain of Coventry City for the 2008–09 season.

Dann signed for Birmingham City on 12 June 2009 for an undisclosed fee, described as a "club record fee for a defender"; local press reports suggested the fee to be in the region of £3.5 million, with a possible increase to £4 million, with performance-based add-ons. Surgery during the summer and then a pulled thigh muscle meant Dann was not fully match fit when an injury to Franck Queudrue gave him the chance to make his Premier League debut on 19 September at Hull City. Birmingham won 1–0, and Dann played well and retained his place in the starting eleven.

At Christmas 2009, "The Times"' Patrick Barclay described Dann and defensive partner Roger Johnson as "certainties" for his team of the season so far. His first goal for Birmingham came against Derby County in the FA Cup on 13 February 2010, during a run of 15 games unbeaten in all competitions, including a club record 12 unbeaten in the top flight. A calf injury sustained in training caused him to miss the last three games of the season as the club finished in ninth place, their best for more than 50 years.

Dann scored the opening goal as Birmingham beat a Hong Kong XI 3–2 in an invitation match branded the Xtep Cup, part of the club's 2010 pre-season tour of the Far East, and his first Premier League goal, a header from a Sebastian Larsson cross, on the opening weekend of the 2010–11 season as Birmingham drew 2–2 away at Sunderland. Following surgery on a hamstring damaged in the League Cup semi-final in January 2011, Dann was ruled out for the remainder of the season. The club were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the season.

On 31 August 2011, the last day of the transfer window, Blackburn Rovers signed Dann on a four-year deal for an officially undisclosed fee, reported by BBC Sport as £6 million. Dann said that manager Steve Kean, with whom he had worked at Coventry, was "a big factor" in his decision to join the Ewood Park club. He was given squad number 16. On 11 September, he made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage, starting alongside Christopher Samba and completing the full 90 minutes as Rovers earned their first point of the season. During the 2–1 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion in December, Dann scored his first goal for Rovers, but also suffered a ruptured testicle, an injury which was expected to keep him out for six weeks. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Dann made a total of 28 appearances in all competitions and also suffered relegation for the third time in his career as Rovers finished in 19th place in the Premier League.

On 12 March 2013, Dann was officially confirmed as captain of the club, succeeding Danny Murphy.

On 31 January 2014, Dann signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Premier League club Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 8 February in a 3–1 home win against West Bromwich Albion.

Dann won the club's Player of the Year award for 2014–15, followed by the Player's Player of the Year award for 2015–16.

In July 2015 he signed a new five-year contract with the club.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Dann replaced Mile Jedinak as captain. He was succeeded by Jason Puncheon for 2017–18. Both Dann and Puncheon suffered cruciate ligament injuries in the same match, against Manchester City in December 2017, that kept them out for the rest of the season. Dann returned to action just over a year later, starting in the FA Cup third round match against Grimsby Town.

Cheikhou Kouyaté

Cheikhou Kouyaté (born 21 December 1989) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for English club 
Crystal Palace and captains the Senegal national team.

Kouyaté moved from Senegal to Belgium in 2006, having been offered a youth contract at RWDM Brussels. After breaking into the first team, he went on to play just ten appearances before moving to Anderlecht aged 19. In June 2014, he joined West Ham of the Premier League. He represented the Senegal national team at the 2012 Olympics.

Kouyaté began his footballing career in 1996 in his hometown with ASC Yego Dakar and was scouted by RWDM Brussels in September 2006. RWDM Brussels then signed the player in January the following year. He went on to play ten league appearances for the first team between 2007 and 2008.

As Kouyaté turned 19, he left Brussels because his former employers did not pay him three months' worth of wages. He subsequently moved to Belgian rivals Anderlecht on a four-year deal for a free transfer. Kouyaté went on to make 153 league appearances for Anderlecht, scoring four goals in five seasons at the club. He won the 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013–14 league titles as well as the 2010–11, 2012–13 and 2013–14 Belgian Super Cups.

On 18 June 2014, Kouyaté signed for West Ham United on a four-year contract. He made his West Ham debut on 16 August 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. His performance was described as "impressive" by the BBC. The following week, manager Sam Allardyce compared him to ex-Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. On 28 December, Kouyaté scored his first West Ham goal in a 1–2 defeat to Arsenal. His second goal of the season came on 8 February 2015 in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United. His performance in the game won praise from manager Allardyce for Kouyaté's Man of the Match performance which was also singled out as the Individual Performance of the Season, by a West Ham player, at the clubs' annual awards. He scored two further goals in the season, in a 2–2 away draw with Tottenham and in a 2–1 away defeat to Leicester City. Kouyaté finished the season having played 31 out of a possible 38 Premier League games.

On 9 August 2015, Kouyaté scored the opening goal in the 43rd minute in a 2–0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. He then scored in a 4–3 home defeat to AFC Bournemouth on 22 August. He scored his third goal of the season in a 2–2 draw with Norwich City on 26 September, netting the equalizer in the 90th minute to rescue a point for West Ham. In March 2016, Kouyate signed a new, five-year contract with West Ham that could keep him at the club until 2021. Kouyaté was sent-off twice during the 2015–16 season and on both occasions had the card rescinded by The Football Association (FA). On 21 February, he was dismissed by referee Jonathan Moss in a 5–1 FA Cup win at Blackburn Rovers, only for the card to be rescinded a few days later. On 2 April, he was dismissed in a Premier League game at the Boleyn Ground against Crystal Palace by referee Mark Clattenburg. This too, however, was overturned a few days later.

On 4 August 2016, Kouyaté scored West Ham's first ever goal at the Olympic Stadium, coming in the eighth minute of a Europa League game against NK Domžale. He also scored the second in the game, which West Ham won 3–0. On 26 October 2016, Kouyaté scored the opening goal in a 2–1 EFL Cup victory against rivals Chelsea. On 8 April 2017, Kouyaté scored a "stunning low 25-yard strike", as West Ham beat relegation rivals Swansea City.

On 23 September 2017, Kouyaté scored his first goal of the season in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham. Kouyaté's final goal for the club came on 24 November 2017, scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Leicester City. Kouyaté marked the headed goal with a lowered crossed-armed celebration, designed to help raise awareness about the ongoing slavery in Libya.

On 1 August 2018, Kouyaté completed a move to fellow London club Crystal Palace, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £9.5 million.

Kouyaté was called up aged 18 to the Senegal under-20s in the same year as his RWDM Brussels debut. He scored two goals in just three games for the side in 2007.

In February 2012, Kouyaté was called up to the Senegal senior team. In the same year, he was announced to be in the squad for Senegal Olympic football team. He played in every game as Senegal's debut appearance in the tournament ended in a knockout in the quarter-final. In January 2015, he was a member of Senegal's squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, held in Equatorial Guinea. Kouyaté is the current Senegalese captain. In May 2018 he was named in Senegal's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Andros Townsend

Andros Darryl Townsend (born 16 July 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for club Crystal Palace and the English national team.

A graduate of the Tottenham Hotspur academy and featuring in various England youth teams, Townsend was initially loaned out to several League One and then Championship clubs alongside limited Tottenham appearances, before gaining his Premier League debut on 16 September 2012. After further limited appearances and then a half-season loan to Premier League club Queens Park Rangers, Townsend established himself as a Tottenham player for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. He subsequently fell out of favour at Tottenham, and following a short spell at Newcastle United in the 2015–16 season, he transferred to Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016.

In his senior international career, Townsend earned his first England cap on 11 October 2013, and has gone on to make thirteen appearances, scoring three goals.

Townsend joined the Tottenham Hotspur academy at the age of eight. In March 2009, he went on loan to Yeovil Town, making his football league debut against Milton Keynes Dons alongside fellow Spurs academy player Jonathan Obika. He made ten appearances and scored one goal for Yeovil as they avoided relegation.

Townsend entered the senior Tottenham team under manager Harry Redknapp. In August 2009, he went on a month's loan to League One club Leyton Orient, extended at the end of the month to the end of December, after which he returned to Tottenham. In 26 appearances for Orient, Townsend scored twice, including a "great goal" in a 3–3 draw against Yeovil, passing three opposing players with a run that began in his own half, leading the opposition manager to lament that his players had not been more ruthless and taken him down with a professional foul.

Having not yet made his Tottenham debut, on 14 January 2010, Townsend was again taken on loan by a League One club, Milton Keynes Dons, until the end of the season, although he was recalled after just two months due to injuries. In nine matches for the Dons he had scored twice. The season ended without Townsend having made his debut for Tottenham.

On 12 August 2010, Townsend signed another season-long loan, moving up to the Championship level with Ipswich Town, but this was terminated on 20 December, as Redknapp believed he had not been playing regularly enough. He had played 16 times, scoring once.

On 9 January 2011, Townsend marked his senior Tottenham debut in a third round FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane against Charlton Athletic, scoring the first goal and being voted Man of the Match. This proved to be his only appearance for Tottenham for the rest of the season, with two further loan spells occurring. He joined Championship club Watford on 20 January 2011 on loan until the end of the season, but this was terminated early, on 23 February, with Townsend having made three appearances. On 7 March, Townsend again went on loan to a Championship club until the end of the season, this time Millwall. By April he said he would be happy to stay at the club beyond his loan spell. In 11 appearances he scored twice.

For the first half of Tottenham's 2011–12 season, Townsend was a regular in their Europa League campaign, making six appearances in the competition, scoring his second goal for the club in their final match in the competition against Shamrock Rovers on 15 December 2011, curling in a shot from outside the box. On 23 December, he signed a contract extension, making him a Tottenham player until the end of the 2016 season.

With only one other appearance for Tottenham, in the League Cup, on 1 January 2012, Townsend joined Championship club Leeds United on loan until the end of the season, but with his agent claiming he was unhappy at the club, he switched the loan to their Championship rivals Birmingham City in February. At Leeds, he made seven appearances, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, and scored one goal. At Birmingham, he made 16 league appearances, including in their second leg tie in the unsuccessful Championship promotion playoff against Blackpool.

Townsend remained with Tottenham for the first half of their 2012–13 season, with the club now under a new manager, André Villas-Boas, who replaced Redknapp in the summer. He made his Premier League debut with a late substitution appearance on 16 September. Although appearing a further four times in the Premier League, these were all still late substitute appearances. Outside the league he made a further five appearances, once in the League Cup and FA Cup respectively, and three times in the Europa League. He scored his third Tottenham goal in the League Cup, a fine individual effort in a 3–0 victory against Carlisle United in the third round.

On 31 January 2013, Townsend followed Redknapp to Premier League club Queens Park Rangers on a loan deal until the end of the season. He made twelve appearances for the club, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, scoring two goals in March, a dipping volley from outside the penalty area in a 3–1 win at home to Sunderland, and an equalising deflection in a 3–2 away loss to Aston Villa. QPR were ultimately relegated, and Townsend returned to his parent club.

Now back at Tottenham, Townsend started the second Premier League match of their 2013–14 season, and went on to make a total of 33 appearances, including 25 in the league. He scored twice, in a 5–0 away victory over Dinamo Tbilisi in the Europa League (his first match of the season), and his first in the Premier League in a 2–0 victory away to Aston Villa on 20 October 2013. In the middle of the season, Townsend came under the management of his third Tottenham boss, after Villas-Boas was replaced by Tim Sherwood.

With Sherwood's contract terminated at the end of the season, Townsend started the club's 2014–15 season under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. He made a total of 35 appearances, scoring 5 goals, but was reduced to just 17 appearances in the league, having been unable to hold down a starting place until the second half of the season. He started as Tottenham lost 2–0 to Chelsea in the 2015 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on 1 March.

On 4 November 2015, having not started a league match of the 2015–16 season, Townsend was dropped from the squad following a touchline argument with the club's fitness coach. Having apologised, Pochettino allowed Townsend to return to the squad by 17 November, and stated the matter was over and he was available for selection again. He never made a first team appearance for Tottenham following the incident, being an unused substitute three times, the last time on 10 December.

On 26 January 2016, having still not started a league match, Tottenham agreed a transfer fee with Newcastle United for Townsend, reportedly £12 million. Before the fee had been announced, Townsend had already tweeted a goodbye message, and stated "As soon as I knew of Newcastle's interest they were the only club I wanted to join...Two of the best positions you can play in football are centre-forward and left wing at Newcastle. I've got the chance. I could never turn that down. I can't wait to play my first game at St James' Park". The transfer was confirmed the following day, a five-and-a-half-year contract but with the club declining to disclose the fee. On signing, his new manager, Newcastle head coach Steve McClaren, said of Townsend that he is a "winger with an old-fashioned style. He can play on the right or the left, is two-footed, quick, very direct and loves taking on defenders and crossing the ball." According to Sky Sports, the transfer had been under negotiation for a week and Newcastle had initially wanted Townsend on loan, and then had a transfer offer of £10.5m rejected.

Despite his debut for Newcastle being in a disappointing team performance in an away defeat, at the next match, his home debut, he was given a standing ovation after a Man of the Match performance which saw Newcastle climb out of the relegation places. His first goal for the club came in his third match, a shot from just outside the area, but it was just a 90th minute consolation goal in a 5–1 away defeat to Chelsea.

On 1 July 2016, Townsend joined Premier League club Crystal Palace on a five-year contract from Newcastle following their relegation to the Championship. Palace triggered his £13 million release clause just six months after he joined from Tottenham. He was originally assigned the number 17 shirt for his first season with Palace, however after Bolasie left for Everton, it was announced that Townsend had been reassigned the vacant number 10 shirt previously worn by Bolasie.

Having had nine loan spells, Townsend's career path to regular first team football for Tottenham is often discussed in the context of a wider debate in English football about the best way to develop young talent, contrasting the loan route with Premier League players being developed in Under-21 leagues, or being brought to the Premier League level via transfers from lower league clubs. According to his father, the loan spells were the making of his son's career, while Tottenham's former Director of Football Damien Comolli who was dismissed in October 2008 believes Townsend succeeded in spite of the way Tottenham handled him.

Townsend represented England at under-16, under-17 and under-19 level. He played three times for the under-16s between 2006 and 2007, making his debut in a 1–1 draw away with Wales on 20 October 2006 and his last appearance in a 2–0 away loss to Germany in April 2007. He scored twice on his under-17 debut, in a 6–1 win over Northern Ireland in August 2007, and went on to make six appearances, the last in a 0–0 draw with Portugal on 5 February 2008.

Townsend received his first call up to the England under-21 team in October 2012 for the Euro 2013 play-off matches against Serbia. He made his debut in the first leg as a 65th-minute substitute for Liverpool's Raheem Sterling.

In May 2013, Townsend was charged by The Football Association over alleged breaches of its rules on betting. He subsequently voluntarily withdrew from England's squad for the upcoming European Under-21 Championship finals. He later admitted to charges under the FA's rules for breaching football betting regulations. After a personal hearing, he was fined £18,000 and suspended for four months backdated to 23 May 2013, with three months suspended until 1 July 2016.

Townsend's first call-up to the senior England squad came in September 2013, for the World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine. He made his senior debut in the starting eleven against Montenegro in the World Cup qualifier on 11 October, aged 22 years 87 days. He was involved in England's first goal in a 4–1 win, scored the third with a "low swerving finish" from outside the penalty area after 78 minutes, two minutes before being substituted, and was named man of the match. He earned a second cap in the World Cup qualifier against Poland, a playing almost all of the 2–0 home win, on 15 October 2013. Two further appearances came in the November friendlies, a 57th minute sub appearance in the 2–0 home defeat to Chile, and a full match in the 1–0 loss to Germany. His fifth cap came as a very late substitute in a March 2014 friendly, a 1–0 home win over Denmark.

A second England goal came in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign in a 5–0 win over San Marino on 9 October 2014, as he came on for the final third of the match. His next appearance marked his third England goal; on 31 March 2015 he scored the equaliser in the 79th minute against Italy, having come on as a 70th minute sub in a friendly match which ended 1–1. The 20-yard strike was described as a "sweet right-foot drive into the bottom corner"; Townsend took to Twitter immediately after the match to respond to Paul Merson after he had said Townsend's club form did not justify him being anywhere near the England team. His eighth and ninth caps came in June 2015, first as a 66th minute sub in the 0–0 away draw to Ireland in a friendly on 7 June 2015, before playing for the first two-thirds of a 3–2 away win over Slovenia on 14 June 2015 in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. His tenth cap was in another Euro 2016 qualifier, this time as a 73rd minute sub in the 3–0 away win over Lithuania on 12 October.

Townsend was born in Leytonstone, London. He is of paternal Jamaican and maternal Greek Cypriot descent. He was brought up in Chingford, and is a lifelong Tottenham fan. He attended Rush Croft Sports College.

When he was 10 years old, his older brother Kurtis was killed in a car crash at the age of 18.

Townsend was filmed singing the song "Stand By Me" by Ben E. King with the rest of the Tottenham youth players in the dressing room, which became a popular internet video.

Wilfried Zaha

Dazet Wilfried Armel Zaha (born 10 November 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Crystal Palace and the Ivorian national team.

Zaha advanced into the Crystal Palace first team from their academy, in 2010. In January 2013, he transferred to Manchester United for an initial fee of £10 million, Alex Ferguson's last transfer before his retirement at the end of the season. Zaha remained on loan at Palace until the end of the season, helping them return to the Premier League. After an unsuccessful 2013–14 season with Manchester United (partly spent on loan at Cardiff City), Zaha returned to Palace in August 2014 on a season-long loan, before rejoining the club on a permanent basis in February 2015.

Born in the Ivory Coast, Zaha grew up in England from the age of four. He made his debut for the England national team in 2012. He made two non-competitive appearances for England, the last of which came in 2013, before switching his allegiances to the Ivory Coast ahead of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.

Born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Zaha moved with his family – including his eight siblings – to Thornton Heath in the London Borough of Croydon, at the age of four. He was educated at Whitehorse Manor Junior School, Thornton Heath and Selsdon High School, Selsdon.

He played football at school, and joined the Crystal Palace academy aged 12.

Zaha was given his Crystal Palace first-team debut at home to Cardiff City on 27 March 2010 by caretaker manager Paul Hart as a substitute for Stern John with 10 minutes remaining in the 2–1 loss. He signed a two-year professional contract with Palace in April.

He quickly progressed through the ranks at Palace and became a key member of the first team during the 2010–11 pre-season friendlies. On 7 August 2010, he scored his first senior goal in a 3–2 win over Leicester City. Zaha assisted Kieron Cadogan in the home match against Queens Park Rangers and James Vaughan in the away match against Watford. On 12 April 2011, he was sent off in the 95th minute against Leicester City for an alleged stamp on Patrick van Aanholt but it was later rescinded. Zaha ended the season playing a total of 44 matches, while scoring 1 goal and having 2 assists in all competitions.

Zaha started the 2011–12 season by scoring two goals in a League Cup match on 23 August 2011 at home to Crawley Town. On 30 November, Zaha impressed in Crystal Palace's 2–1 shock win over Manchester United in the League Cup, constantly sneaking through the United defence and in January, attracting interest from Liverpool and Manchester United.

In March 2012, Zaha was voted The Football League's Young Player of the Year.

In the latter part of the season, manager Dougie Freedman opted to play Zaha as a striker and on 21 April he scored in a 2–2 draw with Reading, in a match that saw Reading secure the Championship title. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Zaha was voted Crystal Palace Young Player of the Year for a second time in a row. During this season, he made 48 appearances while scoring 9 goals and recording 5 assists.

Zaha started the 2012–13 season brightly, getting an assist in the League Cup against Exeter City and winning a penalty in the first league match against Watford. Zaha scored his first two goals of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 October 2012. He then scored two goals in a match again, four days later, in a 4–3 win over Burnley.

On 5 March 2013, Zaha scored his first goal for Crystal Palace since being loaned back from Manchester United, in a 4–2 victory against promotion rivals Hull City. On 13 May 2013, in the second leg of the play-off semi-final against Brighton, Zaha scored two goals in the second half to put Crystal Palace into the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. In the play-off final on 27 May 2013, Zaha won a penalty that was converted to secure Crystal Palace a Premier League spot for 2013–14.

On 25 January 2013, Zaha agreed to join Premier League club Manchester United, and would immediately be loaned back to Crystal Palace for the remainder of the season. Palace tried to delay the transfer and agree the transfer in the summer of 2013, but Football League rules prevented this with the player having to join United and be loaned back to Palace. Zaha passed the medical at Manchester United, signing a five-and-a-half-year contract on 26 January 2013 for a reported £10m rising to £15m with performance-related add-ons.

On 11 August 2013, Zaha made his debut for Manchester United in the 2013 FA Community Shield against Wigan Athletic. He was included in the starting line-up and played 61 minutes before being replaced by Antonio Valencia as he won his first major honour in football. He did not play again until 29 October, starting in a 4–0 win over Norwich City in the third round of the League Cup at Old Trafford. His Premier League debut was on 7 December in a 1–0 home loss to Newcastle United, as a substitute for Nani shortly after his team conceded.

On 31 January 2014, Zaha completed a loan move to Cardiff City for the remainder of the 2013–14 season after being left out of favour by manager David Moyes.

At the end of the season, following Moyes' sacking, Zaha said that he was never given a chance by the Scot. He contrasted his experience with that of Raheem Sterling, another young attacker who was given a chance by Liverpool after a difficult start. He also said that false and malicious online rumours about him had upset him.

On 28 August 2014, Zaha agreed to a season-long loan deal with Crystal Palace. Two days later, in the first match of his loan, he scored a stoppage-time equaliser in a 3–3 draw at Newcastle United. On 2 February 2015, the final day of the winter transfer window, Zaha's move to Palace was made permanent with the signing of a five-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. It also included a buy back clause, believed to be in the region of £3 million, rising to £6 million with add-ons; Manchester United will also receive a percentage of the fee if Palace sell Zaha in the future.

Zaha played regularly for Crystal Palace throughout the season, finishing the season with four goals and two assists as Crystal Palace finished the league in 10th place.

Again, Zaha was a regular for Crystal Palace in this season, making 34 appearances, scoring two goals and recording one assist, while Crystal Palace finished in 15th place. He helped Crystal Palace reach the 2016 FA Cup Final, by playing in every match since the third round entry and scoring two goals along the way. Zaha played the whole 120 minutes in the final, but could not help Palace to a victory, as Manchester United won 2–1. Zaha won the Crystal Palace Player of the Year award for the first time.

On 26 December 2016, Zaha was declined a penalty in the closing minutes against Watford. Some speculated that Zaha had overplayed the foul or taken a dive. After the match Watford's mascot attempted to rile Zaha up by mimicking a dive in front of him. On 14 May 2017, Zaha scored the opening goal in the third minute of the Crystal Palace Hull city game that simultaneously mathematically secured Crystal Palace's top flight status and relegated Hull City to the Championship. After another outstanding season with The Eagles, Zaha won Crystal Palace's Player of the Year award for the second year running. On 26 May 2017, Zaha signed a new five-year contract with Crystal Palace.

On 14 October 2017, Zaha returned to Palace's starting line-up for the first time in two months and scored to open a 2–1 win over Chelsea to give the Eagles their first points of the season. He was Premier League Player of the Month for April 2018 for his four goals and assist while playing up front; on 14 April he scored twice in the first half of a 3–2 win over rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. 

Despite their poor start, Palace stayed up with a game in hand under new manager Roy Hodgson, with the combination between Zaha and fellow winger Andros Townsend a key factor. He was named their Player of the Year for the third time in a row, a feat only done before by goalkeeper Julián Speroni.

In Palace's first game of the new season on 11 August, Zaha scored the second goal of a 2–0 win at Fulham. It was his 23rd Premier League goal for the club, drawing level with Chris Armstrong as their top scorer in the competition's history. Fifteen days later, with a consolation goal in a 2–1 loss at Watford, he overtook Armstrong.

After scoring a winning goal against Huddersfield Town in September 2018, Zaha publicly complained about what he considered to be a lack of appropriate protection by referees against fouls, saying that he would need a broken leg before any action would be taken. Data proved that in the last five years, he was the second most fouled player in the league after Eden Hazard.

Zaha received a red card for dissent in a Southampton v Palace match on 30 January.

Zaha was eligible to represent both the Ivory Coast and England, the former because he has Ivorian parents and it was where he was born, and the latter because it is where he grew up.

His success over the course of his first full season resulted in a call-up to the England under-19 team for their match against Germany in February 2011. He was called up to the under-21 team on 23 February 2012. He made his debut in a 4–0 win against Belgium on 29 February, assisting Henri Lansbury for the third goal. On 11 November 2012, Zaha was called up to the senior team by manager Roy Hodgson for a friendly match against Sweden on 14 November. He came on as a substitute for fellow debutant Raheem Sterling in the 83rd minute.

When Zaha was in good form for Crystal Palace under Hodgson ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the manager said that he regretted not fielding the winger in a competitive game to tie him to England.

On 27 November 2016, the Ivorian Football Federation confirmed that Zaha had sent correspondence to FIFA to switch his international football allegiance from England to the Ivory Coast. In response to this development, England manager Gareth Southgate indicated he would try to dissuade Zaha from changing allegiance due to his consistent club form. 

In January, Zaha was named in the Ivory Coast squad for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. He made his debut against Sweden in a friendly in Abu Dhabi on 8 January, being subbed on at half time and assisting Giovanni Sio's goal in a 2–1 win. Three days later, against Uganda at the same venue, he made his first international start and scored his first goal in a 3–0 win. At the tournament in Gabon, the reigning champion Elephants were eliminated at the group stage, with Zaha starting each game.

Zaha can play as a forward or as a winger. In 2018, Adrian Clarke of the Premier League's website opined that he "offers more threat" as a frontman, going on to add that "his ultra-mobile combination with [Andros] Townsend generates more goals and points", citing "the speed, athleticism and unpredictable movement of the Zaha-Townsend axis is more difficult for opponents to contain".

Zaha has been accused of diving, however Roy Hodgson, who managed him at club level for Crystal Palace and internationally for England, has stated: "Wilf Zaha does not dive for penalties. He gets knocked over sometimes – sometimes he gets knocked over or unbalanced without it being a penalty or a foul – because he runs at such speed and has such agility with the ball. But he certainly doesn’t dive". Hodgson also said that Zaha's characterisation as a diver is because of a "campaign" and it causes fouls against him to be dismissed by referees.

Mamadou Sakho

Mamadou Sakho (born 13 February 1990) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Premier League club Crystal Palace and the France national team. He is known for his tackling ability and his passing accuracy.

Sakho began his career at Paris FC before moving to Paris Saint-Germain's youth system in 2002. In October 2007, on his league debut, he became the youngest player ever to captain a Ligue 1 club. Sakho made over 200 appearances for the club, winning all four domestic trophies. In 2013, he transferred to Liverpool for £18 million. He had a loan spell with Crystal Palace in 2017, and was subsequently bought by the team for £26 million on 1 September 2017.

Sakho is a full international, who has previously earned caps and captained the nation at all youth levels. Since making his senior debut in 2010 against England, Sakho has over 25 caps and represented France at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Sakho was born in Paris to Senegalese parents and was the fourth child of a family of seven children. He was raised in the northern neighborhood of Goutte d'Or.

Sakho started his football career at the age of six playing for the juniors of hometown club Paris FC. In 2002, he was lured away to professional club Paris Saint-Germain. Sakho was originally a striker, but due to Paris Saint-Germain's youth team having fewer defenders than strikers, he was moved into a more defensive role.

Sakho struggled to adapt during his first year at the Camp des Loges, the headquarters of the club's youth academy, often refusing to accept orders handed out by the trainers, such as when to go to bed. At one point, he was threatened with expulsion from the club due to his constant bad behavior. Following guidance from his parents and, particularly, under-13 Paris Saint-Germain coach Christian Mas, Sakho curbed his bad behavior and began to focus on his studies and football. When Sakho was 14, his father suddenly died. The resulting pain led to Sakho considering leaving football, but he later described that idea as "useless" and returned to the club after bereavement. Sakho quickly became one of the club's most sought after prospects winning numerous MVP awards during his time in the youth academy. In April 2005, he was a part of the Île-de-France region team that won the 2004–05 Coupe Nationale. That same year, he was a part of the Paris Saint-Germain under-18 team that won the "Championnat National des 18 ans" league title, despite being three years younger than many of his teammates.

In total, Sakho spent nearly six years at the Camp des Loges. A day after his 17th birthday, manager Paul Le Guen called the youngster up for the club's UEFA Cup Round of 32 first leg match against AEK Athens on 14 February 2007. Sakho started the match picking up a yellow card in the 20th minute. He played 85 minutes before being substituted out as Paris Saint-Germain won the match 2–0. Sakho played his second and final match of the season in the UEFA Cup Round of 16 first leg match against Benfica, he played the full match in a 2–1 victory.

On 14 June 2007, Sakho signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal. He was officially promoted to the senior side for the 2007–08 season, despite being only 17 years old, and was assigned the first team number 3 shirt. Sakho made his first start that season for Paris Saint-Germain in the club's 3–0 win over Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue on 26 September 2007, starting in the centre back role alongside the experienced Colombian Mario Yepes. Sakho made his league debut on 20 October against Valeciennes in a 0–0 draw. In an effort to galvanize the questionable leadership of several senior team players, such as first-team captain Pauleta and vice-captain Sylvain Armand, Le Guen named Sakho captain for the match. Sakho's role as captain made him the youngest-ever captain of Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 17 years and 8 months and also the youngest player to ever captain a side in Ligue 1. In the following match against Lyon, he was named captain again and tasked with the role of containing fellow French starlet Hatem Ben Arfa. Despite Sakho and the club putting up a strong fight, Ben Arfa scored two goals in a span of three minutes as "Les Parisiens" suffered a 3–2 defeat. In the club's following match against Nancy, Sakho picked up an extensive injury, which ruled him out for two months. He returned to action on 23 February 2008, playing the entire match in a 1–1 draw against Monaco. On 29 March, Sakho started and play the full 90 minutes in the Paris Saint-Germain's 2–1 victory over Lens in the 2008 Coupe de la Ligue Final. The victory awarded Sakho the first major trophy of his career. In total that season, Sakho made 16 appearances.

In the following season, Sakho made 34 total appearances contributing to the Paris Saint-Germain's successful play where the club reached as high as 2nd in the league, reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France, and made it to the UEFA Cup quarterfinals. On 30 January 2009, due to his positive play and clubs from abroad constantly inquiring for his services, Paris Saint-Germain awarded Sakho a contract extension until the June 2012. Two weeks later, he scored his first career goal for the club in a league match against Saint-Étienne on 14 February 2009, a day after his 19th birthday. The goal gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1–0 lead and the club went on to win the match 2–1.

Sakho opened the 2009–10 season as the incumbent starter partnering either veterans Sammy Traoré or Zoumana Camara in defense. Midway through the season, Sakho was embroiled in controversy when he allegedly slapped a "Le Parisien" newspaper journalist at the Camp des Loges, the club's training center. Before the incident, Sakho had allegedly confronted the journalist to question the accuracy of an article he had written referring to the controversy surrounding why Sakho went to a nightclub following Paris Saint-Germain's embarrassing loss to Lorient hours earlier. Sakho reportedly insulted the journalist and then slapped him before walking away. The journalist, who preferred to remain anonymous, filed a complaint the following day with both he and the newspaper describing Sakho's attitude as "unprofessional". Paris Saint-Germain president Robin Leproux and manager Antoine Kombouaré issued an apology on the club's behalf and Sakho later apologized to the journalist by telephone.

Sakho started the 2010–11 campaign partnering with Camara in defense. He was also installed as the team's captain in the UEFA Europa League by manager Kombouaré due to the unavailability of Claude Makelele. Midway through August, Sakho began appearing in the centre back position alongside veteran Sylvain Armand. He scored his first goal of the season on 11 September 2010 in a 4–0 victory over Arles-Avignon. In Europe, Sakho captained the team in their 5–4 aggregate victory over Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League playoff round. He accomplished this feat again in the group stage leading the team to a 2–0 victory over Ukrainian club Karpaty Lviv. On 16 October, Sakho scored the game-winning goal in a 2–0 victory over Toulouse. In the team's first match following the winter break, he scored his third goal of the campaign in Paris Saint-Germain's victory over Sochaux. After a prolonged period of negotiations, on 8 March 2011, Sakho signed a two-year contract extension with the club until June 2014. On 20 April, he captained the team to a 3–1 victory over Angers in the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. The victory inserted the club into the 2011 Coupe de France Final; the club's second consecutive appearance in the competition's final match. Paris Saint-Germain lost the match 1–0 to Lille. On 10 May, Sakho was nominated for the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Young Player of the Year award. Two weeks later, he won the honour. Sakho was also named to the organization's Team of the Year alongside club teammate Nenê.

Sakho began the 2011–12 season as the club's first-choice captain under Kombouaré. On 13 August 2011, in the club's second league match of the season, he suffered a hamstring injury. Despite initially being ruled out for three weeks, Sakho missed two months and returned to the team in its 3–1 away win over Ajaccio. He remained a fixture in the team for the rest of the autumn campaign as PSG finished the first half of the league in first-place position. In January 2012, Kombouaré resigned from his position. He was replaced by Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti. Under the helm of Ancelotti, Sakho retained the captaincy and appeared as a starter through March. However, after unconvincing performances in draws with Lyon, Caen, and Bordeaux, which resulted in the club losing its grip on first place, the captain was benched by Ancelotti and stripped of the captaincy. Ancelotti based Sakho's benching on the increased competition in the squad as the Italian preferred the central duo of Milan Biševac and Alex. Sakho was also questioned by club director Leonardo for being "slightly overweight".

After making a cameo appearance in the "Le Classique", Sakho made his second appearance since his benching on 29 April 2012 appearing as a first-half substitute for the injured Biševac against fellow title contenders Lille. In the second half, with "Les Parisiens" leading 1–0, Sakho conceded a penalty after fouling striker Nolan Roux. The foul also resulted in a red card. Lille converted the penalty and later went on to win the match 2–1.

On 26 May, in PSG's final game of the season having already won the league, Sakho came on as an emergency goalkeeper for the final seven minutes against Lorient after substitute goalkeeper Ronan Le Crom had been sent off for fouling Julien Quercia to give away a penalty. Arnaud Le Lan converted the penalty, but PSG won 3–1.

On 2 September 2013, Premier League club Liverpool announced the signing of Sakho for a fee of £18 million.

Sakho made his debut on 16 September 2013 against Swansea City in a 2–2 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had described the Frenchman as "a beast in training" prior to his debut. On 7 December 2013, Sakho scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 4–1 win at Anfield against West Ham United. Intermittent injuries limited Sakho to just 19 appearances, however he played a key role in Liverpool's surprise title challenge where they eventually finished as runners-up in the Premier League.

On 27 September 2014, Sakho was left out of the squad for the Merseyside Derby clash against Everton. Upon hearing the manager's decision, he left the stadium. The Frenchman later apologised for his action. After a poor beginning to the season, manager Brendan Rodgers switched to a 3-man defensive line in October – with Sakho playing a crucial part. His pace, athleticism, and ball playing abilities were key in this formation. Sakho returned to the Liverpool team for a 2–2 draw with Arsenal on 22 December 2014 and went on to help the Reds to five clean sheets in eight Premier League matches.

Sakho began the season as backup to Dejan Lovren. On 17 September 2015, Sakho made his first start of the season; a man-of-the-match performance in a Europa League away match against Bordeaux, captaining the side in a 1–1 draw. A day later, it was announced that he had signed a new long-term contract with the club. Sakho was restored to the starting lineup and under new manager Jürgen Klopp was praised for his excellent form. On 8 November, however, he sustained a knee injury in a 2–1 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield that ruled him out for two months.

Sakho was praised in Liverpool's victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League quarter-finals. He coped against in-form striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 1–1 away draw in the first leg, and then scored a header as they mounted a late comeback to win the second 4–3.

On 23 April 2016, it was announced that Sakho was being investigated by UEFA for violating an anti-doping rule, after he was tested on 17 March following a Europa League game against Manchester United. The club, along with Sakho, agreed that while UEFA were investigating, he would not be available for team selection. Five days later, after testing positive for a fat-burner, UEFA punished him with a 30-day ban from all European football, which FIFA extended to cover all world football. On 28 May 2016, the ban expired after the substance was found to not be in the banned substance list. On 8 July 2016, the case was dismissed by UEFA.

On 18 July 2016, it was announced that Sakho would wear the number 3 jersey for the 2016–17 season, switching from the number 17 he had worn since he joined Liverpool. During Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States, Sakho was sent home by manager Jürgen Klopp for not respecting the rules that had been put in place for the squad. Klopp revealed that Sakho had been late for the team's flight as well as for a subsequent medical treatment session and a team meal time. As a result, Sakho was demoted from the senior squad and thus only played competitive football with the reserves in the Professional Development League that season.

On 31 January 2017, Sakho signed with Crystal Palace on loan until the end of the season. Sakho made his debut appearance in a 1–0 victory over Middlesbrough on 25 February, and was praised by manager Sam Allardyce for his role in Crystal Palace's victory. After Palace kept clean sheets in victories against West Bromwich Albion and Watford, Sakho was named a nominee for the Premier League Player of the Month award for March and was also awarded Crystal Palace's Player of the Month on March 31. Sakho followed this up with well-received performances in Palace's 1–2 victory at Stamford Bridge over league leaders Chelsea and a 3–0 home win over Arsenal.

On 31 August 2017, Sakho signed for Crystal Palace on a four-year contract, with a transfer fee of £24 million plus £2 million in add-ons being agreed with Liverpool.

Sakho has been active with France at youth level. As early as the age of 13, he began featuring with regional youth sides playing for Île-de-France alongside fellow youth internationals Yacine Brahimi, Tripy Makonda, Maxime Partouche, and Sébastien Corchia. Sakho made his debut for the under-16 team on 21 March 2006 in a friendly match against Germany in a 3–1 victory. He scored his only goal for the team in their 1–0 victory over England in the Montaigu Tournament. France later won the competition defeating Italy 2–1 in the final. With the under-17 team, Sakho made his debut in the team's opening match against Cyprus in an international youth tournament. Midway through the season, Sakho was named captain by coach François Blaquart who noticed the player's leadership skills. Under Sakho's captaincy, the team reached the 2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and, later, the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup by virtue of their semi-final appearance in the UEFA-sanctioned tournament. At the U-17 World Cup, which was held in South Korea, Sakho captained the team to a quarter-final appearance where they lost to Spain in a penalty shootout.

Due his increased playing time with his parent club, Sakho only made four appearances with the under-18 team. He made his debut for the team on 18 December 2007 in a friendly match against Portugal and later featured in two friendly matches against Germany, one of which was played at the GAZi-Stadion auf der Waldau in Stuttgart. Similarly with the under-19 team, Sakho's play with the team was limited not only due to his playing time with Paris Saint-Germain, but also due to his commitments with the under-21 team. Despite making only four appearances with the team, he was selected to play in the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Paris Saint-Germain, however, refused his participation in order to preserve the player's fitness with the player having already played in the 2009 Toulon Tournament, which was held the same month.

Sakho made his France U21 debut on 19 August 2008 in a friendly match against Slovakia. He played in the 2009 Toulon Tournament and captained the team on two occasions serving in place of the lead captain for the tournament, Étienne Capoue, who came off the bench. On 8 September 2009, Sakho scored his first under-21 goal in a 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification match against Ukraine. The match ended in a 2–2 draw. A month later, he was installed as the first-choice captain of the team following the selection of former captain Moussa Sissoko to the senior team.

On 5 August 2010, Sakho was called up to the France senior team for the first time by new manager Laurent Blanc for the team's friendly match against Norway on 11 August 2010. He didn't make his international debut in the match, but was subsequently called up by Blanc for national team matches in September and October 2010. On 17 November 2010, Sakho made his senior international debut against England in a 2–1 win at Wembley Stadium, appearing as a substitute at the start of the second half for Philippe Mexès.

On 19 November 2013, in the second leg of their 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine, Sakho scored his first and second international goals, giving "Les Bleus" a 3–2 aggregate win to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 13 May 2014, Sakho was named in Didier Deschamps' squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He made his FIFA World Cup debut in the team's opening match, keeping a clean sheet in partnership with Raphaël Varane in a 3–0 defeat of Honduras. In the second match, "Les Bleus" were again on course for a shutout with Sakho in defence, leading 3–0 against Switzerland when he was substituted with an injury in the 66th minute. The team eventually ran out 5–2 winners to qualify for the knockout stage. Sakho returned to the side for the next match, helping France to another clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with Ecuador.

On May 17, 2018, he was named on the preliminary list for the French squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He ultimately did not make the final list.

Sakho is renowned for his energy on the pitch, and had cult status at Liverpool for his interaction with the supporters. In April 2016, Richard Innes of the "Daily Mirror" described him as "a defensive maverick; a man who plays by his own rules", who practises an "often highly "alternative" approach" to defending.

Sakho is married to Majda, with whom he has two daughters, Aida and Sienna, born in 2013 and 2015, and a son, Tidiane, born in 2018.

As part of Liverpool Football Club's work in the community, Sakho helped teach the French language to local children when he played for them.

Sakho is a Muslim.

Wayne Hennessey

Wayne Robert Hennessey (born 24 January 1987) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Crystal Palace and the Wales national team.

Hennessey's first professional games saw him set a new League Two record for consecutive clean sheets while on loan at Stockport County. He played 166 times for Wolverhampton Wanderers over eight seasons, including three years at Premier League level. After several injury setbacks, he moved to join Crystal Palace in 2014.

A full international since 2007, Hennessey has earned more than 80 caps for Wales.

Hennessey is a cousin of Terry Hennessey, who earned 39 caps for Wales from 1962 to 1972. Born in Bangor, Gwynedd and raised in Beaumaris, Anglesey, Hennessey speaks Welsh and was educated at Ysgol David Hughes but switched to Connah's Quay High School as it was easier to travel to Manchester. Hennessey began as a trainee at Manchester City but was released in 2003, whereupon he joined the youth academy at Wolverhampton Wanderers. After progressing through the ranks, he signed professional forms in April 2005.

After remaining in Wolves' reserve and youth teams during the 2005–06 season, Hennessey was sent on trial with Bristol City in July 2006 with a view to a loan move to gain first team experience but was recalled to Wolves after an injury to their first-choice goalkeeper Matt Murray. He did go back to Bristol City in August 2006, however, on a one-month loan deal, but he did not make an appearance and returned to his parent club early due to an arm injury.

To gain first-team football, Hennessey joined League Two side Stockport County in January 2007 on a one-month loan. On his senior debut against Boston United, he kept a clean sheet and after keeping another five clean sheets in successive matches, his loan spell was extended by an extra month.

He went on to set a Football League record of nine successive clean sheets and wins. Stockport broke the 119-year-old record, when they beat Swindon Town 3–0 on 3 March 2007. After this accomplishment, he was named the League Two Player of the Month for February 2007. His feat also means he now holds County's record for the longest period without conceding a goal, beating Harry Hardy's 85-year-old record. His record now stands at 857 minutes, from the start of his competitive club debut, against Boston United on 13 January 2007, until Oliver Allen of Barnet scored on 10 March 2007. He therefore did not concede in his first nine-and-a-half matches of competitive club football.

Hennessey was recalled by Wolves in April 2007 after another injury to first-choice Matt Murray, and found himself on the substitutes bench for several games. When Murray broke his shoulder on the eve of Wolves' Championship play-off semi-final first leg against local rivals West Bromwich Albion, Hennessey stepped in to make his Wolves debut.

With Murray sidelined for the whole of the 2007–08 season with yet another injury, Hennessey became firmly established at the club's number one, being an ever-present in the league and signing a new extended contract. At the end of the season he was named in the 2007–08 PFA Championship Team of the Year as well as being named Wolves' Player of the Season. "FourFourTwo" magazine ranked him 22nd in their Top 50 Football League Players list.

The 2008–09 season saw a strong start for Hennessey and Wolves with eight victories out of the first nine league games. This fine run ended against promotion rivals Reading with a 0–3 loss begun by an own goal from Hennessey. Soon after manager Mick McCarthy dropped him to the bench, citing mental fatigue as the reason. Reserve keeper Carl Ikeme deputised and impressed enough to leave Hennessey on the sidelines until an injury ruled him out for the majority of the season. Hennessey then regained and kept his place in goal for the remainder of the season which culminated with promotion to the Premier League as champions after a five-year absence.

Hennessey began the club's 2009–10 Premier League campaign as first choice goalkeeper, making his 100th senior appearance for the club in a 2–2 draw at Stoke City in October 2009. However, after conceding four goals in two successive games, he was replaced by the more experienced Marcus Hahnemann and remained on the bench for the rest of the season as the club finished 15th.

In July 2010, Hennessey extended his contract with Wolves to run until the summer of 2015. The following season began with Hahnemann retaining the number one spot until his own loss of form saw Hennessey return to the starting line-up in November 2010. He then held on to the spot for the remainder of the campaign as the club narrowly avoided relegation on the final day.

During the 2011–12 season, Hennessey was part of the Wolves defence that went a club record of 30 consecutive league games without a clean sheet. They finally ended this with a goalless draw at Sunderland in April 2012, but by then the team was rooted to the bottom of the table. Despite the game halting this run, it brought bad news for Hennessey as he suffered a torn cruciate knee ligament during it that was due to keep him sidelined until Autumn 2012. After completing several reserve games during his comeback he re-injured the knee during training in November 2012 which kept him out of action for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.

He made his return to the Wolves goal during pre-season ahead of their 2013–14 campaign – with the club now in League One having suffered two relegations since Hennessey's initial injury – but he was not selected to start the club's opening fixtures. On 12 August 2013 it was agreed for the goalkeeper to spend a month on loan at Yeovil Town as he recovers from his long-term injury problems. However, before this deal was officially concluded Hennessey suffered a hamstring problem while on international duty with the Welsh national team and so the proposed loan was scrapped. Although, on 21 August 2013, after an injury to Yeovil's replacement goalkeeper Sam Johnstone Hennessey officially joined Yeovil Town on an initial one-month loan which was eventually extended until 17 November 2013. He made his Yeovil debut in a 0–3 loss to Derby County on 24 August 2013. In his penultimate home match Hennessey received the man of the match award after the Glovers achieved their first ever home win at Championship by defeating Nottingham Forest.

After his loan spell at Yeovil ended, Hennessey returned to Wolves but did not displace Carl Ikeme in goal. When Ikeme suffered an injury in January 2014, Hennessey declined to play in the following fixture against Gillingham, launching speculation that he wanted a move away from the club. Although he subsequently apologised for his refusal to play, he did not play again for Wolves and negotiations were later entered into with Premier League team Crystal Palace.

On 31 January 2014, Hennessey joined Crystal Palace on a three-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee, with media speculation suggesting it to be an initial £1.6 million, with add-on clauses. Hennessey made his debut for the Eagles in the team's final match of the Premier League season, a 2–2 draw with Fulham on 11 May 2014.

Hennessey's first appearance of the 2014–15 season came a 3–0 win at Walsall in the Football League Cup second round. On 25 October, he made his first Premier League appearance of the season as a substitute for injured first choice goalkeeper Julián Speroni in a 2–2 draw at West Bromwich Albion. He ended the season starting in Palace's final two league fixtures, wins against Liverpool and Swansea City, keeping his first Premier League clean sheet for the club in the latter match.

After starting in Crystal Palace's 2015–16 Football League Cup second and third round matches, Hennessey was selected to start the Premier League fixture against Watford in place of Alex McCarthy. He kept a clean sheet as Palace won 1–0 at Vicarage Road and has retained his place as the team's first choice goalkeeper, making five consecutive league appearances.

Hennessey was capped for Wales at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level. He once scored for the under-19 side with a 40-yard free kick against Turkey.

He made his full international debut for Wales in a 2–2 friendly draw against New Zealand on 26 May 2007 and has since established himself as his country's first-choice goalkeeper. Hennessey made his 50th appearance for Wales on 3 September 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win over Cyprus in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying.

Hennessey played in all ten of Wales' qualifying matches for UEFA Euro 2016, conceding just four times, as they reached their first major international tournament since the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was named in Wales' 23-man squad for the tournament as first choice goalkeeper but was forced to miss the opening game of the tournament, a 2–1 victory over Slovakia, after suffering a back spasm prior to the match, being replaced by Danny Ward.

In January 2019, an investigation was launched by the FA after Hennessey was pictured making what appeared to be a Nazi salute in a group photo posted on Instagram by teammate Max Meyer. Hennessey denied making the salute, claiming that "any kind of resemblance to that kind of gesture is absolutely coincidental".

Jeffrey Schlupp

Jeffrey Schlupp (; born 23 December 1992) is a professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Crystal Palace and the Ghana national team as a left back or winger. He started his career as a striker.

Schlupp is known for his extreme pace and athleticism, which allows him to be a versatile option and able to play anywhere on the left wing. Former teammate Andrej Kramarić once said of Schlupp, "I've never played with a more powerful player than Jeffrey Schlupp, such power and speed like I've never seen before."

Schlupp was part of the Leicester team that shocked the footballing world, by winning the 2015–16 Premier League as rank outsiders with the odds of 5000–1.

Jeff Schlupp was born to Ghanaian parents in Hamburg, Germany, on 23 December 1992, and raised mostly in England after his family moved there when he was young. He attended Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes along with Salford City F.C goalkeeper Max Crocombe.

A product of the Leicester City youth academy, Schlupp was given a squad number, 31, for the first time for the 2010–11 season along with fellow academy players Tom Parkes and Jorrin John by then manager Paulo Sousa. Schlupp signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2013 on 14 March 2011. Schlupp was named amongst the Leicester City substitutes for the first time by, then manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson in the 3–2 home defeat to Norwich City on 8 March 2011.

Schlupp joined Brentford on a one-month loan on 14 March 2011, declining a call up to the Germany Under-19 squad in order to complete the move. He made his senior debut in a 1–0 defeat to Huddersfield Town coming on as a substitute on 77 minutes on 15 March 2011. On his first full senior appearance in his career he scored two goals winning the match against Carlisle United 2–1 on 25 March 2011. Schlupp earned a start in Brentford's next match and proved himself once more by scoring a header from a Lewis Grabban cross against Sheffield Wednesday in a 3–1 victory.

On 3 April Schlupp started in the 2011 Football League Trophy Final, playing the full 90 minutes. Schlupp hit the post with an effort on goal. Carlisle United won the match 1–0.

On 14 April the loan deal was extended to the end of the 2010–11 season.

On returning to Leicester, Schlupp travelled with the squad on their tour to Sweden often playing in friendlies as a left-back. He was given the squad number 27 for the 2011–12 season. In his first competitive senior appearance for the club he scored a hat-trick against Rotherham United in the League Cup first round on 9 August. He made his league debut in a 2–0 defeat to Reading on 13 August, and scored his first league goal in a 4–0 win over Derby County on 1 October. Schlupp scored his second league goal, and Leicester City's 4,000th home league goal, against Birmingham City in the 80th minute of 13 March 2012 Championship clash. Schlupp ended his first season in the Leicester first team, scoring six times in 26 games in all competitions.

Schlupp spent a week in January 2013 training with Manchester United. This trial was extended into a second and third week into the beginning of February. During his time at Manchester United he played two under-21 games, a game against Liverpool and then a game against West Ham at Upton Park.

Upon Schlupp's return to Leicester he found his way into the Leicester team both at left back and in attack, scoring three goals towards the latter part of the 2012–13 season. Schlupp scored key goals in back to back home games against Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers.

Schlupp opened his goalscoring account for the 2013–14 season, rounding off a 3–1 away win to against Millwall on New Year's Day 2014 with smart finish through the goalkeeper's legs on his weaker foot. Following regular left-back Paul Konchesky receiving a three-match suspension for a red card against East Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest, Schlupp found greater opportunities at the back of the Leicester side, putting in highly rated performances against Ipswich Town and Charlton Athletic.

On 16 August 2014, Schlupp made his Premier League debut as a second-half substitute against Everton on the opening weekend of the season. On 4 October, Schlupp scored his first Premier League goal, in the 2–2 draw with Burnley. Schlupp scored his second goal of the season on 29 November, in the 2–3 defeat against Queens Park Rangers before adding his third in the 2–2 draw against Liverpool on 1 January 2015. On 18 May 2015, Schlupp's fine first season in the Premier League was met with reward as he was named Leicester City's Young Player of the Year, as voted by the fans, as well as winning the Players' Player of the Year award.

Schlupp started as the left back during Leicester's flying start to the season, although he later moved into a midfield role as the season progressed. Schlupp scored his first goal of the season in the 2–1 away victory against Norwich City. He was ruled out for six weeks in December with a hamstring injury. After returning from the injury Schlupp had a strong impact on Leicester City's season, and contributed hugely to Leicester's unlikely title triumph. As a result of his successful season Schlupp was named Leicester's Young Player of the Year for the second year running beating Demarai Gray and Ben Chilwell to the award.

On 13 January 2017, after only four league appearances for Leicester City in 2016–17, he joined Premier League club Crystal Palace for a reported £12 million. His first appearance for the club ended in defeat by three goals to nil to London rivals West Ham United.

Schlupp was called up to a Germany under-19 training camp in early 2011, but did not earn a cap in Ralf Minge's side.

On 7 November 2011, Schlupp was called up to the Ghana squad to face Sierra Leone and Gabon. Schlupp made his Ghana debut against Gabon on 15 November, coming on as a late substitute for Prince Tagoe.
In April 2014, it was reported that The Black Star's coaching team are believed to have watched Schlupp play with a view to taking him to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil following a string of impressive performances for Leicester. Schlupp played in a friendly against Netherlands on 31 May but wasn't named in Ghana's final 23. Schlupp was recalled to the Ghana squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Uganda and Togo in September 2014. Schlupp earned his fourth cap as a late substitute in Ghana's 3–1 win against Togo in the Blackstars last African Cup of Nations qualifier on 19 November 2014. Schlupp returned to the Black Stars squad in March 2015, coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2–1 defeat to Senegal on 28 March and playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Mali on 31 March.

Schlupp scored his first goal for Ghana in a 7–1 win over Mauritius in an African Cup of Nations qualifier on 14 June 2015.

Schlupp became a father in January 2014 to a son, Arlo.

Christian Benteke

Christian Benteke Liolo (born 3 December 1990) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Crystal Palace and the Belgium national team.

He began his career at Standard Liège, playing a part in their 2008–09 Belgian First Division triumph. Following a season at Genk he was signed for £7 million by Aston Villa. He scored 49 goals in 100 matches for Villa across all competitions, including 19 Premier League goals in his debut season and helping them to the 2015 FA Cup Final, before transferring to Liverpool in 2015 for £32.5 million. He spent a single season at Liverpool, scoring a total of ten goals, before being transferred to Crystal Palace at the start of the 2016–17 season.

Benteke has earned over 30 caps for Belgium since making his debut in 2010. He missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup through injury, but was part of their team that reached the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2016.

Benteke was born in Kinshasa in 1990. He and his family fled during the Mobutu regime and in 1993 emigrated to Liège, Belgium.

Benteke played youth football for JS Pierreuse and later Standard Liège before moving to Genk. He rejoined Standard in January 2009 and scored three goals in 12 matches as the Walloon club won the 2008–09 Belgian championship. On 7 August 2009, he joined KV Kortrijk on loan for a season, where he scored 14 goals in the Belgian Pro League, including five goals in the championship play-offs, as the club achieved its best ever finish.

He spent the following season on loan at KV Mechelen as part of the transfer of Aloys Nong, who moved from Mechelen to Standard Liège. Benteke's spell at Mechelen was less successful, with seven goals from 25 appearances. He returned to Genk from Standard in August 2011 for an undisclosed fee, and went on to score 16 goals and register nine assists in 20 starts during the 2011–12 season.

After beginning the 2012–13 season with three goals from five league matches, Benteke was subject of an offer of €6m from Premier League club Aston Villa in August 2012.

On 31 August 2012, Benteke joined Premier League club Aston Villa on a four-year deal for a fee believed to be around £7 million. Benteke stated it was a dream come true in getting a move to the Premier League and thanked the players and manager at K.R.C. Genk for his move.

On 15 September 2012, Benteke scored on his debut for Aston Villa in a 2–0 win against Swansea City, after coming on as a substitute for Austrian forward Andreas Weimann. The goal came when Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed the ball into Benteke's path, which he then lifted over the keeper and tapped in on the volley. Villa manager Paul Lambert praised Benteke's performance on his debut calling him "unplayable". He then scored Villa's only goal in a 1–1 home draw with Norwich City. He added a further two goals to his tally during a 3–2 victory over Swindon Town in the League Cup. He scored the winner in a 1–0 Premier League victory for Villa against Reading at Villa Park on 27 November to continue his impressive start in English football.

Benteke then scored Villa's fourth goal in a 4–1 League Cup win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. Benteke further added to his impressive start in Premier League football by scoring two goals in Villa's 3–1 win against Liverpool at Anfield on 15 December. In addition to the two goals, he also assisted Villa's second goal with a back-heel to Andreas Weimann. Paul Lambert said afterwards that 'Benteke has been unbelievable', after already stating midweek (post–Norwich) that 'you run out of things to say about the guy, how well he's performing and how young he is'. Around Christmas time, Tottenham Hotspur manager André Villas-Boas was reportedly interested in signing Benteke, referring to him as the season's "surprise package".

After not scoring for three games, Benteke scored Villa's first penalty kick in almost a year in a 2–2 draw away to Swansea City in Villa's first game of 2013. He recorded his 10th goal of the season with a 28-yard strike against West Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion in a 2–2 draw at The Hawthorns. The goal was nominated for January's goal of the month competition on Match of the Day. He then netted Villa's first goal in their 2–1 League Cup semi-final victory over Bradford City. However, the victory was not enough as Bradford won 4–3 on aggregate to progress to the final. Former England striker Michael Owen called him one of the signings of the season and posted a tweet the day after the semi-final saying: 'I'm seriously impressed with Benteke. What a player.' Benteke continued his rich scoring form with a goal against Newcastle United and a brace against Everton, in a game that Villa had led 3–1 at one point but eventually finished 3–3. He racked up his 15th goal in all competitions, as well as tallying six goals in five games, when he scored a penalty in a 2–1 victory against West Ham United on 10 February 2013. This was Villa's first league victory in eight games, since Benteke inspired the win against Liverpool back in December.
Benteke scored a deflected goal in a 2–1 victory at Reading, scoring the club's 1,000th goal in the Premier League in the process. The following week he went on to score a goal that sealed a 3–2 win over Queens Park Rangers. He then scored the third goal to seal a 3–1 win against relegation rivals Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Benteke was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year after his excellent debut season, eventually finishing as runner-up to eventual double award winner Gareth Bale. On 29 April, Benteke scored his first hat-trick for Aston Villa in a 6–1 thrashing of Sunderland. These goals also saw him exceed Dwight Yorke's record for most Premier League goals in a season (18) by an Aston Villa player and pass the 20 goal mark in all competitions, becoming the first player to do so for Villa since Juan Pablo Ángel in the 2003–04 season.

On 11 May, Benteke scored Villa's only goal in a 1–2 loss to Chelsea but in the second half he was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for a high boot on John Terry, meaning he would miss the last game of the season.

Benteke's 23 goals in 2012–13 led to speculation about his future, and in early July he submitted a transfer request. Villa said he could leave only if their valuation were met, but a fortnight later he withdrew his transfer request, after talks with manager Paul Lambert, and signed a new four-year contract with the club. On his second pre-season appearance, he scored a hat-trick against Crewe Alexandra in a 5–1 victory. He finished pre-season with seven goals in five appearances, including two goals against Málaga at Villa Park.

On 17 August 2013, Benteke scored twice, once from a penalty and one headed goal via a rebound from a missed penalty, in Aston Villa's 3–1 away-win against Arsenal on the opening day of the 2013–14 Premier League season.
Four days later, Benteke scored against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a 2–1 defeat. He scored his fourth goal in as many games, as Villa comfortably beat League One side Rotherham United 3–0 in the League Cup second round. He continued scoring, as he racked up his fifth goal in all competitions, against Newcastle United in a 1–2 defeat at Villa Park. However his brilliant early season form was abruptly ended, as he was injured in the next match against Norwich City. It was later confirmed that he would be out for up to six weeks with a hip flexor injury. However, he made his comeback earlier than expected, after coming on as a substitute against Tottenham Hotspur a month later in a 2–0 defeat.

After loss of form and niggling injuries prevented Benteke scoring for 12 games (his last goal being against Newcastle on 14 September), he eventually ended his drought against Arsenal in a 1–2 defeat on 13 January 2014. He followed this up with goals in back-to-back games against Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion, in a 2–2 draw and 4–3 victory respectively. Having not scored throughout February, the Belgian then scored a superb overhead volley as well as a header, in an eventual 4–1 home victory against Norwich City on 2 March.

On 3 April 2014, Benteke suffered a rupture of his achilles tendon while training and was ruled out for at least six months, missing the remainder of the season and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 2 November 2014, Benteke was given a straight red card by referee Neil Swarbrick for pushing the face of Tottenham Hotspur's Ryan Mason after Mason had stuck his face in Benteke's chest. Villa had been winning at the time, but went on to lose 2–1. The incident led to both clubs being fined £20,000 by The FA for failing to keep their players under control.

He scored his second goal of the season against Manchester United in a 1–1 draw at Villa Park. It took him until early March to score his next goal, a 94th-minute penalty in a local derby against rivals West Bromwich Albion. On 7 April, he scored his second Premier League hat-trick in a 3–3 draw with Queens Park Rangers. Twelve days later, he equalised as Villa came from behind to defeat Liverpool and reach the 2015 FA Cup Final, their first for fifteen years. On 2 May, he scored twice in a 3–2 win at home to Everton, taking him to a total of eleven goals in nine matches since the arrival of Tim Sherwood as manager. Six days later, Benteke was announced as the Premier League Player of the Month for April. He played the full 90 minutes in the FA Cup Final as Villa lost 0–4 to Arsenal, being beaten to a header by Per Mertesacker for the third goal of the rout.

On 22 July 2015, Liverpool completed the signing of Benteke on a "long-term contract" after meeting his release clause of £32.5 million, at the time making him their second most expensive transfer ever. He made his debut on 2 August in a pre-season friendly at Swindon Town, putting Liverpool into the lead with a volley as they went on to win 2–1.

On 9 August, Benteke made his competitive debut by starting in a 0–1 win at Stoke City. Eight days later he scored his first league goal for Liverpool in a 1–0 home win over newly promoted Bournemouth. On 12 September, he scored an overhead kick in a 1–3 defeat to rivals Manchester United.

After missing several games through injury, Benteke returned to score in consecutive games as a substitute on 25 and 31 October: a 1–1 draw against Southampton and a 1–3 away win against Chelsea. On 26 December, he replaced compatriot Divock Origi in the first half of a home fixture against league leaders Leicester City, and scored the only goal in a victory that curtailed the visitors' nine-game unbeaten run.

On 8 January 2016, Benteke was named as captain for Liverpool's FA Cup third round tie with Exeter City at St James Park.

On 11 May 2016, Benteke scored his tenth goal of his only season at Liverpool with a 92nd-minute equaliser in the team's final home game of 2015–16, a 1–1 draw with Chelsea. Benteke was often found on the bench because he wasn't fitting into Jürgen Klopp's style of play. Because of this, he ended his stint at Liverpool after making 42 appearances and scoring 10 goals.

On 20 August 2016, Premier League side Crystal Palace completed the signing of Benteke on a four-year deal for a fee of £27m which could rise by a further £5m, bringing the total fee to £32m. On 10 September 2016, Benteke scored his first goal for Palace in a 1–2 victory against Middlesbrough, in just his second league game. On 24 September 2016, Benteke headed home a goal against Sunderland in the 94th minute to cap Palace's comeback from 2–0 down to win 3–2. On 3 December 2016 (Benteke's birthday), he scored twice in a 3–0 win over Southampton that ended Palace's run of six consecutive defeats. Benteke marked his return to Anfield, the ground of his former club Liverpool, with two goals in a 2–1 win on 23 April 2017. He finished his first season with Palace as their top-scorer, with 15 league goals and 17 in total. The next season was less successful, with Benteke not scoring until December, and finishing the season with just three league goals in 30 appearances.

Benteke was a member of the Belgium U17 team at the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup in South Korea where he played three games and scored once.

On 19 May 2010, he made his senior debut for the Belgium national team in a friendly match against Bulgaria in Brussels after his former coach at Kortrijk, Georges Leekens, became national coach. On 15 August 2012, he scored his first goal in a 4–2 win against the Netherlands. Since then, he has become a regular starter for Belgium under Marc Wilmots. On 29 May 2013, he scored twice in a 4–2 friendly victory against the United States in Cleveland, Ohio.

He scored two goals in seven appearances during qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but was ruled out of the tournament finals with a ruptured Achilles tendon.

Benteke returned to Belgium's squad for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, scoring his first international goal for two years in a 5–0 defeat of Cyprus on 28 March 2015. He was selected for the final tournament in France, and made his tournament debut in the second group game on 18 June, replacing Romelu Lukaku for the last seven minutes of a 3–0 win over the Republic of Ireland in Bordeaux. He played three more minutes in place of the same player four days later in a victory over Sweden, but took no further part as the Belgians reached the quarter-finals and lost to Wales. On 10 October 2016, Benteke set a record for the fastest goal in a World Cup match—either qualifying or the finals—when he scored after 8.1 seconds against Gibraltar in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match, breaking the 23-year-old record previously held by Davide Gualtieri. He scored twice more to complete his first hat-trick for Belgium.

He was left out of the final Belgium 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup despite initially being named in the preliminary squad.

Benteke is a Christian. He points up to the sky after scoring goals to thank God, and also prays frequently. He has a younger brother, Jonathan, who is also a footballer.

Benteke's goal celebration features him beating his chest. The celebration appears in EA Sports’ video game "FIFA 18".

James McArthur

James McFarlane McArthur (born 7 October 1987) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Premier League club Crystal Palace.

McArthur started his career at Hamilton Academical and was part of the team that won the 2007–08 Scottish First Division title. He made over 190 appearances for Hamilton before joining Wigan Athletic in July 2010. McArthur helped Wigan win the FA Cup in 2013. He was transferred to Crystal Palace in the summer of 2014.

McArthur made 32 international appearances for the Scotland national team between 2010 and 2017.

Born in Glasgow and raised in the city's Barrowfield district, McArthur attended Whitehill Secondary School and supported Rangers in his youth; he played for Rangers South BC (alongside future international colleagues Robert Snodgrass and Graham Dorrans), St Johnstone pro youth, Rangers SABC and Clyde before moving to Hamilton Academical as a youth in 2003. He made his professional debut in January 2005 against Ross County. He established himself in the Hamilton team the following season and scored his first goal in April 2006 against St Johnstone.

Such was his progress that he was given the captaincy for Hamilton against Aberdeen in February 2008 for a Scottish Cup tie and nominated for the First Division Player of the Year for the 2007–08 season. In May 2008 after helping his side to the Scottish First Division, McArthur was awarded with a new three-year contract. By the time he departed from New Douglas Park aged 22, he had played in nearly 200 matches for "Accies".

In the 2009–10 season, several English Championship and Premier League clubs, including Sheffield United, West Bromwich Albion, Leeds United and Sunderland, showed an interest in McArthur. On 5 April 2010, McArthur went on a three-day visit to Premier League club Wigan Athletic with a view to a permanent move in the summer. He signed a four-year contract at the DW Stadium on 23 July for a fee of around £500,000. The move reunited him with former Hamilton teammate James McCarthy, who had made the same move at the beginning of the 2009–10 season. On 31 January 2012, McArthur scored his first goal for Wigan in a 3–1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur, and followed it up two games later with a winning goal over Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium in a game which finished 2–1 to Wigan. McArthur extended his contract with Wigan in May 2012, with the new deal due to run until 2016. On 11 May 2013 McArthur won the FA Cup, playing the whole game in a 1–0 upset win against Manchester City. However, only three days later, Wigan were relegated from the Premier League following a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal.

Wigan rejected a first offer of £5 million from Leicester City for McArthur in August 2014, but then accepted a proposed valuation of nearly £7 million. A payment schedule was not agreed and the proposed transfer collapsed, with Leicester signing Esteban Cambiasso instead. On the last day of the summer 2014 transfer window, Wigan accepted a £7 million offer from Crystal Palace for McArthur.

On 1 September 2014, McArthur signed a three-year contract with Crystal Palace after joining from Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee; due to a clause in his Wigan contract, his former club Hamilton received a sell-on fee from the Crystal Palace transfer, which they used to invest in the youth system through which the player had emerged. McArthur scored his first goal for Palace on 13 December, in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City.

In February 2016, McArthur tore ankle ligaments in a 2–1 loss to AFC Bournemouth. He returned in time to take part in the 2016 FA Cup Final, which Crystal Palace lost 2–1 to Manchester United after extra time.

In May 2018, having helped his club to maintain top division status for the fifth consecutive season of his spell at Selhurst Park, McArthur was recognised by the Premier League for reaching 200 appearances in the competition.

He was first called up to the Scotland under-21 squad in February 2008, and he made his debut at that level against Ukraine later that month. 

On 16 November 2010, McArthur made his senior international debut as a second-half substitute for Charlie Adam against the Faroe Islands. He scored his first international goal on 9 February 2011, in a Nations Cup match against Northern Ireland.

As of August 2018, McArthur had made 32 international appearances and scored four goals. At this time he advised Scotland manager Alex McLeish that he wished to be excused from international games while he managed ongoing back problems. Later that year, he announced his retirement from international football.

Connor Wickham

Connor Neil Ralph Wickham (born 31 March 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays for Crystal Palace as a forward.

He played youth football at Reading before moving to Ipswich Town in 2006 where he continued in the youth structure. He made his full professional debut for the club in April 2009. He has also played at various levels of international football, scoring the winning goal in the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship Final.

Wickham was born in Hereford, Herefordshire, the son of an Army Warrant Officer, He attended Philip Morant School in Colchester, where he achieved eight A-C grade GCSEs – as well as being a prominent member of the school football team, where he was a prolific goalscorer from a young age. He played youth football with Reading for four years. Wickham's father is Northern Irish.

Wickham made his debut for the Ipswich Town first team on 11 April 2009, aged 16 years and 11 days. He came on as a 66th-minute substitute for Veliče Šumulikoski in a 3–1 home defeat against Doncaster Rovers and in doing so he became Ipswich's youngest ever player, beating the previous record being held by Jason Dozzell by 46 days.

Wickham scored his first two senior goals in only his fourth appearance, when he scored in Ipswich's 2009–10 League Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town. He also scored in the penalty shootout, which saw Ipswich prevail 4–2. He scored his first league goal in a 1–0 home victory over Scunthorpe United in March 2010, his winning effort coming deep into injury time. In April 2010, Wickham scored his second league goal, which came in the 90th minute in a 3–1 victory over Derby County. This came two days after he signed his first professional contract at Ipswich, a two-year deal following his 17th birthday.

In April 2010, Wickham was named the Football League young player of the month. He won the award after scoring three goals in four matches during that time. The following month Tottenham Hotspur made offers to buy Wickham, but these were rejected by Ipswich Town.

Wickham extended his contract with Ipswich to 2013 in January 2011. It has an offer clause in it which states that if any bid equals or beats the one written in the contract, Ipswich would have to allow him to speak to the bidding club. It was reported that the figure was around the £15 million mark.

On 22 January 2011, Wickham scored Ipswich's his first goal of the season in a 3–2 win over Doncaster Rovers. Two games later, Wickham scored in a 3–0 win over Sheffield United at Portman Road. A clearance of a set piece saw Wickham pass two opponents before wrong-footing Rob Kozluk and goalkeeper Steve Simonsen to tap the ball into the net. Former Ipswich player, Kevin Beattie witnessed the goal, and described it as one of the greatest goals ever scored at Portman Road. Two weeks later Wickham recorded his first professional hat-trick in a 6–0 win at Doncaster Rovers. Wickham's superb scoring form continued when he scored late in the match against Reading on 8 March. With Ipswich already 3–0 down, his goal counted for little, although it was once again a superb finish, as he volleyed a ball that was coming over his shoulder into the top corner of the goal from a tight angle.

On 4 March 2011, Wickham was named Championship player of the month for February after scoring four goals in the month, including his first professional hat-trick at Doncaster. Two weeks later he was named the Football League Young Player of the Year as well as the Championship Apprentice of the Year at the 2011 Football League Awards.

On 2 April 2011, Tottenham Hotspur manager, Harry Redknapp admitted that his side had not made a bid for Wickham. This was despite several reports to the contrary suggesting a bid in the region of £10m had been made. The same day, Wickham scored the second of Ipswich's two goals against Burnley in the Championship, as they won 2–1.

He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 8 April 2011, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2014. Wickham admitted he was delighted to have signed the contract, and said he just wanted to concentrate on achieving his goals with Ipswich, rather than focusing on speculation about his future. He said:

He scored his next league goal on 7 May away to Leicester City, making the score 3–2 in Leicester's favour.

On 29 June 2011, Wickham signed a four-year deal with Premier League club Sunderland for a fee of £8 million. The fee has the potential to rise to £12 million over the course of the contract.
Despite having recently signed a new contract with Ipswich, Wickham had been widely tipped to move to a Premier League club following a highly successful 2010–11 season. Although Ipswich manager Paul Jewell had said there was no pressure to sell the youngster, Sunderland's eventual offer proved too lucrative. The fee broke Ipswich's record for transfer fees recouped, and broke the transfer record for a Football League player moving to a Premier League club. Ipswich's chief executive Simon Clegg summed it up:
He scored his first goal for Sunderland in a pre-season friendly against Kilmarnock. Wickham made his first competitive appearance for Sunderland when he came on as a substitute in the 1–0 defeat to Newcastle United in the Tyne–Wear derby on 20 August 2011. He made his first Premier League start for Sunderland on 22 October 2011 where he helped Sunderland secure their second win of the season against Bolton Wanderers.

Wickham scored his first Premier League goal for the "Black Cats" a week later in the 2–2 draw with Aston Villa. The following week against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Wickham suffered a knee injury and had to be substituted just five minutes into the game. The arrival of new manager Martin O'Neill saw Wickham fall out of favour as he spent the majority of the remainder of the season on the bench and playing for the reserves. Wickham came off the bench at Bolton Wanderers in the third round of the FA Cup to score his first goal of the season as Sunderland came from 2–0 down to earn a replay.

On 8 February 2013, Wickham joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan, initially on a one-month deal. He made his debut on 9 February, in a 2–2 draw against Derby County. He scored his first goal for the club on 9 March, in a 1–0 win away against Leicester City in what was the last game of his loan spell, firing a first time volley into the roof of the net. On 14 March 2013 it was confirmed that Wickham would not be re-joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan.

On 27 August 2013, Wickham inspired Sunderland to a late comeback against Milton Keynes Dons in the Football League Cup, scoring twice and assisting Jozy Altidore's goal as the Premier League side scored four times in the last 20 minutes to win 4–2.

On 1 November 2013, Wickham re-joined Sheffield Wednesday in another loan move until 1 January 2014. Wickham scored on his return in the 5–2 win over Reading at Hillsborough on 2 November. Wickham again appeared on the score sheet scoring a brace of goals in the 2–1 win over Leicester City on 3 December. Four goals in four games in December 2013 earned Wickham a nomination for the December Championship Player of the Month award but he ultimately lost out to Leicester City's Danny Drinkwater. On 31 December 2013, his loan spell at Wednesday was extended by a further month, although his parent club prevented him from representing the "Owls" in the FA Cup. On 11 January 2014, he scored in Wednesday's 6–0 win over Yorkshire rivals Leeds United. After the game, he described the win as a "fantastic team performance" while saying that he was "unhappy with my own personal performance." He was recalled to his parent club on 27 January 2014.

On 26 February 2014, Wickham joined Football League Championship side Leeds United on loan until the end of the 2013–14 season. Wickham was handed the number 9 shirt for Leeds.
He made his debut on 1 March 2014 in a 1–1 draw away to Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road.

On 24 March, Wickham was recalled from his loan after playing four games for Leeds to bolster Sunderland's goal scoring options, with Steven Fletcher injured and Jozy Altidore badly out of form.

On 16 April, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium. Three days later, he scored the club's first goal in Sunderland's 2–1 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. On 27 April, he scored a brace to help Sunderland overcome Cardiff City 4–0, playing a pivotal role in Sunderland's late surge to try and avoid relegation. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for April. On 3 May, his cross assisted Sebastian Larsson's goal in a 1–0 win at Old Trafford, making it Sunderland's first win away to Manchester United since 1968.

On 4 October 2014, he scored his first goal of the season and assisted a Steven Fletcher goal in a 3–1 win over Stoke City. In December 2014, Connor Wickham agreed a new four-and-a-half year deal with Sunderland.

On 3 August 2015, Wickham joined Crystal Palace on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee, although some sources reported it as an initial £7 million, rising to a potential £9 million depending upon his performance. Wickham made his debut on 8 August 2015 as a second-half substitute in the 3–1 win at Norwich City.

In November 2016, Wickham sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of first-team action until October 2018. He did not not make an appearance in the starting line-up until January 2019, scoring the opening goal in a 2–0 fourth-round FA Cup win against Tottenham Hotspur.

Wickham is eligible for Northern Ireland, as his father is Northern Irish meaning that until he receives a full cap from England in a competitive game he is still eligible for the national team. His progress in the English Premier League was also being monitored by former Republic of Ireland management duo of Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane. His links to Northern Ireland mean that he also qualifies to play for the Republic of Ireland though there are no reports of Wickham having been approached by current manager Mick McCarthy.

Wickham has represented the England under-16 team and was also on stand-by for the under-17 squad during the 2008–09 season. He won the 2008 Victory Shield with England, scoring in the 2–0 final win over Scotland.

On 11 August 2009, Wickham received a call-up to the under-17 squad, for their three-game FA International Tournament, which would take place later that month.

In May 2010, Wickham was included in the England U17 squad for the UEFA European U17 Championship in Liechtenstein. He was involved in two of the goals in England's 3–1 win against the Czech Republic in the group stage, with a convincing performance. He then played the full game in the second group match against Greece, once again playing well. Wickham was rested for the final group game of the tournament, but returned to face France in the semi-final. He scored both goals for England in a 2–1 victory, both left-footed, and both in the first half. Wickham scored the winner in a 2–1 victory over Spain in the final. He received the ball on the edge of the box before proceeding to beat two defenders and drill the ball low into the net. He was given the Golden Player award by UEFA for the best player in the tournament.

Following the success of Wickham in the England youth set-up, speculation began to mount about him winning a senior cap, and possibly even being included in Fabio Capello's World Cup squad – although seemingly a longshot. Former England defender Russell Osman said:

On 7 September 2010, England under-21 boss, Stuart Pearce admitted that he had been monitoring Wickham's progress, and that he would consider calling him up to the under-21 squad once he had recovered from injury. On 15 November 2010 Pearce did name Wickham in the under-21s friendly match against Germany on 16 November 2010. In that game he came on as a 66th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat for England. Following that game, and the important experience Wickham gained, he returned to the England under-19 side. However, it would not be long before he was back in the fold for the under-21s.

On 14 March 2011, it was announced that Wickham had been included in the squad for England's games against Denmark and Iceland. He came on as a substitute in the game against Denmark, which England went on to win 4–0. The following Monday, Wickham started the game in a friendly against Iceland at Deepdale in Preston. It was his first start for the under-21s, and he played the full 90 minutes as England lost the game 2–1 to a very strong Iceland side that consisted of a number of first team regulars. Wickham played as a lone striker in the game.

Prior to the Iceland game, Wickham admitted that he was hopeful of being included in the squad that would play in the summer's Euro 2011 under-21s tournament due to take place in June. Having been an instrumental figure in the success of the under-17's the previous summer, he felt he could repeat the feat at a higher level. He said:

He scored his first goal for the under-21s on 10 September 2012, scoring the only goal of the game in a win against Norway in Chesterfield, ensuring England won their European Under-21 Championship qualifying group. He scored his second goal on 16 October, helping England to a 2–0 aggregate win in the play-off against Serbia.

In 2010, Wickham signed a sponsorship deal with British sportswear and equipment supplier, Umbro. He appeared in an advert for the new England kit in September 2010 and is one of the flagship wearers of Umbro's GT range of football boots.

Michy Batshuayi

Michy Batshuayi-Atunga (; born 2 October 1993) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Crystal Palace, on loan from Chelsea, and the Belgium national team.

He began his professional career at Standard Liège in 2011, scoring 44 goals in 120 games across all competitions. His 21 goals in the 2013–14 Belgian Pro League made him the second-highest scorer and contributed to his Ebony Shoe Award. He then transferred to Marseille for £4.5 million, helping them reach the 2016 Coupe de France Final. In July 2016, he was signed by Chelsea for £33 million, and scored the goal that won the Premier League title in his debut season.

Batshuayi scored in his international debut for Belgium against Cyprus in March 2015. He was part of their side that reached the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2016 and third place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Born in Brussels, Batshuayi had a nomadic youth career with spells at Evere, Schaarbeek, Brussels (twice) and Anderlecht before he joined Standard Liège.

Batshuayi made his debut for the senior team on 20 February 2011 in a 4–1 loss away to Gent, replacing Franck Berrier for the last seven minutes. Six days later, he made his only other appearance of the Belgian Pro League season, filling in for Aloys Nong in the last minute of a 3–0 victory against KV Mechelen at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne.

On 21 July, Batshuayi was an unused substitute in the 2011 Belgian Super Cup, a 1–0 loss to Gent. On 15 December, he scored his first professional goal, the only one away to Copenhagen in the last match of Group B during the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage, advancing his team into the knockout stages. Six days later, he added two more in a 2–1 win at Lierse in the quarter-final first leg of the Belgian Cup, although his side lost 5–4 on aggregate. He scored his first league goal on 14 January 2012 to round off a 6–1 home win over Germinal Beerschot, and ended the campaign with six. He was sent-off as a substitute in a 3–2 loss at Genk on 22 April for stamping on the chest of Jeroen Simaeys, for which the Royal Belgian Football Association suspended him for four matches.

Batshuayi was again sent-off on 25 September 2012 in a 3–2 win at Mouscron in the sixth round of the Belgian Cup, having elbowed Benjamin Delacourt within the first half-hour; he was suspended for the next two matches of the competition and fined €200. In an interview a month later, he said he felt "destroyed" by the suspension. He recorded 12 goals in 26 matches over the campaign, including two on 19 May 2013 to decide a 4–3 home win over Lokeren.
In the 2013–14 season, Batshuayi scored 21 goals in 34 matches, putting him in second place for the league's top scorer behind Lokeren's Hamdi Harbaoui. This tally included a first professional hat-trick on 15 September in a 4–2 win at Oostende. He was awarded the Ebony Shoe Award for the season's best player of African origin, ahead of Harbaoui.

On 8 August 2014, Batshuayi signed with French club Marseille for a £4.5 million transfer fee. He made his debut the next day as Marseille began the Ligue 1 season with a 3–2 win at Bastia, replacing Dimitri Payet with 11 minutes remaining. On 29 October, he scored his first goal for the club to open a 2–1 defeat at Rennes in the third round of the Coupe de la Ligue. He scored nine league goals for Marcelo Bielsa's team, despite rarely starting matches. On 22 February 2015, within five minutes of coming on for André-Pierre Gignac, he scored twice away to Saint-Étienne in an eventual 2–2 draw. In March, he added further braces in away victories at Toulouse and Lens (6–1 and 4–0 respectively), the latter after taking Gignac's place at half-time.

On 23 August 2015, Batshuayi scored his first goals of the season, a brace, in a 6–0 victory over Troyes. Soon after, club president Vincent Lebrune said, "There is not a single top 15 world club that is not interested in Batshuayi. He is one of the most wanted players on the market. There were a lot of offers for him this summer, but he didn't want to leave. He's proving himself on the pitch, and if clubs want him then they are going to have to pay around €50m." By the mid-season break, he had 11 goals from 19 matches, behind only arch-rival Paris Saint-Germain's Zlatan Ibrahimović, with Marseille in tenth in the league table and PSG in first. Batshuayi finished the league season with 17 goals. He added two more goals from five games in the Coupe de France, one being in the final, where Marseille lost 4–2 to PSG on 21 May 2016.

In April 2016, English Premier League club West Ham United were reported as the favourites to sign Batshuayi, having offered a €35 million bid. Two months later, their London neighbours Crystal Palace made a €38 million (£31.5 million) bid which would have made him their record signing, while Italian champions Juventus were also among the interested parties. Although Palace's bid was accepted, Batshuayi did not want to make the move, instead engaging with a €40 million (£33.2 million) offer from Chelsea, for which he left Belgium's UEFA Euro 2016 squad to undergo a medical. On 3 July, he signed a five-year deal at Chelsea. He was the first signing by their new manager Antonio Conte, and said his aim was to get the team back to winning the Premier League and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. Batshuayi added he was eager to work alongside their midfielder Oscar. Batshuayi joined Chelsea for pre-season in Austria, and on 20 July, he made his debut in a friendly against Wolfsberger AC. A day later, he scored his first two goals in an 8–0 friendly victory against Atus Ferlach.

On 15 August, Batshuayi made his competitive debut in Chelsea's opening match of the 2016–17 season, coming off the substitutes' bench to set-up Diego Costa's late winner in a 2–1 win over West Ham. Five days later, after replacing Oscar, he went on to score his first Premier League goal in a victory by the same score at Watford. On 23 August, Batshuayi made his first start for Chelsea in the EFL Cup, scoring a brace in a 3–2 home victory against Bristol Rovers.

On 12 May, Batshuayi came on as a second-half substitute against West Bromwich Albion with the score 0–0, with Chelsea needing a victory to clinch the Premier League title. In the 82nd minute, he slotted a goal past goalkeeper Ben Foster to win Chelsea their fifth Premier League title. Batshuayi went on to score three goals in Chelsea's final two matches, including the last goal of the season in the 92nd minute of Chelsea's 5–1 win over Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. Batshuayi finished the season with 5 goals in only 236 minutes of Premier League action, equaling a rate of one goal every 47 minutes.

Batshuayi scored his first Chelsea hat-trick on 20 September 2017 in a 5–1 home win over Nottingham Forest in the third round of the EFL Cup.
In a UEFA Champions League group stage match away to Atlético Madrid a week later, substitute Batshuayi scored the added-time winning goal in a 2–1 victory. On 17 January 2018, he scored in a third-round FA Cup win over Norwich City on his 50th appearance for Chelsea. The match finished 1–1 after extra time, with the "Blues" going on to win 5–3 on penalties.

On 31 January 2018, Batshuayi joined German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund on loan for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. His debut came on 2 February away to 1. FC Köln, where he scored twice and had a third disallowed via the video assistant referee, as he was in an offside position. He also made an assist. The match ended 3–2 to Dortmund as an away victory. Batshuayi became the first player to score multiple goals on his Bundesliga debut since the player he replaced at Dortmund, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The following week, on matchday 22, he again scored the opening goal against Hamburger SV as Dortmund won 2–0. On 15 February, he scored twice against Atalanta in the round of 32 first leg of the UEFA Europa League as Dortmund won 3–2 and took the lead going into the second leg. Dortmund's draw in Italy meant the club progressed to the round of 16, although Batshuayi reported hearing "monkey noises" during the match. In March, UEFA's investigation led to both teams being fined for use of pyrotechnics and other crowd disturbances, but Batshuayi's allegations of racism were dismissed. He criticised European football's governing body for their judgement. In a 2–0 loss to Schalke 04 on 15 April, Batshuayi injured his ankle ligaments and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.

On 10 August 2018, Batshuayi was loaned to Spanish La Liga club Valencia for the 2018–19 season. Ten days later, he made his Liga debut as a 76th-minute substitute for Carlos Soler in a 1–1 home draw with Atlético Madrid, then continued that role in subsequent matches in a side possessing Rodrigo, Santi Mina and Kevin Gameiro as striking options. On 26 September, he scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw with Celta de Vigo, therefore becoming the first player to score in the top leagues of France, Germany, England and Spain in the 21st century.

In January 2019, Batshuayi's loan to Valencia was cut short and he joined English Premier League club Crystal Palace on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season. He made his debut on 2 February in a home 2–0 win against Fulham, providing an assist for Jeffrey Schlupp to score the second goal.

Batshuayi was eligible to play for the DR Congo national team through his parents, but in March 2015, he ruled out this option, stating that although his Congolese heritage is important to him, he would rather represent Belgium.

Batshuayi made his international debut for Belgium on 28 March 2015 in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Cyprus. Replacing Christian Benteke in the 77th minute, he scored from outside the penalty area three minutes later to seal a 5–0 victory at home. He was selected for the final tournament in France, making his competition debut in the last 16 against Hungary in Toulouse on 26 June. With his first touch, he finished Eden Hazard's assist for the second goal of a 4–0 victory.

In Belgium's 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Batshuayi scored once in a 4–3 win away to Bosnia and Herzegovina on 7 October 2017, with the "Red Devils" already assured of their place in the final tournament. Manager Roberto Martínez named him in the 23-man squad to go to Russia. In their second group stage match, he came on as a 68th-minute substitute against Tunisia and missed several chances before finally scoring the fifth goal for Belgium in a 5–2 victory.

A December 2015 profiling by "FourFourTwo" likened Batshuayi for his speed, strength, positioning and link-up play to Didier Drogba, despite being shorter than the Ivorian.

Batshuayi is nicknamed "Batsman", a play on the name of the superhero Batman. His younger brother Aaron Leya Iseka plays for Toulouse in the same position, coming through at Anderlecht and signing for Marseille on loan, one month after Batshuayi's exit.

Bakary Sako

Bakary Sako (born 26 April 1988) is a professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club Crystal Palace and the Mali national team.

Sako had been with Châteauroux since 2001, joining the club as an academy player. He made his league debut on the final matchday of the 2005–06 Ligue 2 season coming on as a half-time substitute in a 4–1 victory over Bastia. Following the season, he signed his first professional contract after agreeing to a three-year deal. He was promoted to the senior squad and assigned the number 26 shirt.

During the next two seasons, Sako was limited to mostly substitute appearances. He did score his first league goal, during the 2007–08 season, in a 1–2 defeat against Brest. During the 2008–09 season Sako became an integral part of the team, helping the club narrowly avoid relegation on the final day.

On 9 July 2009, Sako departed Châteauroux for Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Étienne, where he signed a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

On 29 August 2012, Sako signed for Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee that was reported to be £2.2 million. He scored on his Wolves debut in a League Cup tie against Northampton on 30 August 2012, and again on his league debut in the following match, a 3–1 defeat at Cardiff.

The winger adapted well to English football, scoring ten times in total and contributing eleven assists. However, his season was halted early when he tore his hamstring in March 2013 in a match against Bristol City, which ruled him out for much of the season's final games, during which the team were relegated to League One.

Sako was the subject of transfer speculation during Summer 2013 with interest from Fulham in June 2013 but the London club did not meet a reported £4 million asking price. Owing to his uncertain future, the player did not play in Wolves' final match of the transfer window as he "didn't feel he was in the right frame of mind". Several reported bids from Nottingham Forest were rejected by the club. In October 2013, Forest again attempted to set up a deal but Wolves pulled out of negotiations citing that "the terms surrounding the offer were unrealistic".

Despite the initial speculation surrounding his future and the breakdown of his proposed move to Forest, Sako went on to have a productive season for Wolves, finishing as joint top-scorer alongside the departed Leigh Griffiths as Wolves won the League One title with a record points haul for the third tier. Sako was also named in the League One PFA Team of the Year for the 2013–14 season alongside four of his teammates.

Back at Championship level, Sako continued to score regularly for Wolves and was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the 2014–15 season. He finished the season as the club's (joint) top goalscorer as the team missed out on the play-offs on goal difference. Out of contract with the club, he voiced his desire to play in the Premier League, while head coach Kenny Jackett stated that he expected Sako to depart.

On 5 August 2015, Sako joined Premier League side Crystal Palace on a three-year contract following his release from Wolves. He scored his first goal for the club on his full debut against Aston Villa on 22 August 2015.
Sako then scored again the following week away to Chelsea, in a 2–1 win, which was José Mourinho's second ever loss at Stamford Bridge. Sako also assisted the second goal scored by Joel Ward.

In the 2017–18 season, Sako's form started to pick up under the management of Roy Hodgson scoring his first goal of the season against Huddersfield in the EFL Cup. He later scored against Bristol City in the same competition. Sako was also back scoring in the league as well, netting against Watford, Burnley and Leicester. He also added a goal in the FA Cup in an away loss to Brighton & Hove Albion.

On 2 October 2018, West Bromwich Albion signed free agent Sako until the end of the season.

On 27 January 2019, Sako rejoined Crystal Palace on a short-term contract until the end of the 2018–19 season.

Sako played for the Malian U17 team in one friendly match in 2005, while the team was preparing for the 2005 African Under-17 Championship. The following year, he returned to the French team playing with the under-18 squad. He was a member of the French squad that participated in the 2007 European Under-19 Championship reaching the semi-finals before being eliminated by Spain. He made his French under-21 debut on 11 February 2009 in a friendly match against Tunisia. He scored his first under-21 goal in the 2009 Toulon Tournament against Qatar.

Sako was called up by the Malian national team for the first time for a friendly against Senegal on 5 March 2014. He scored his first international goal against Guinea in a friendly match played in Colombes, France, on 25 May 2014. His first goal in competitive internationals came when he scored the opener in a 2–0 win over Malawi in an Africa Cup of Nations qualification match played in Bamako on 7 September 2014.
In December 2014 Sako was called up to the Mali squad for the finals of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Equatorial Guinea in January 2015. This was to be his first taste of a senior international tournament.

Sako started Mali's first two matches in group D of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. These both finished in 1–1 draws, against Cameroon on 20 January and against Ivory Coast on 24 January. Sako scored a left-foot half-volley against Ivory Coast that the BBC hailed as the goal of the tournament at that point. Sako was unable to start the final and decisive group game against Guinea due to an illness though he did appear from the bench for the final 15 minutes of the game. This too ended in a 1–1 stalemate, meaning that five of the six games in group D finished 1–1 and this led to the drawing of lots between Mali and Guinea to decide who qualified for the quarter finals and who went home. It was Guinea who emerged from the hat, meaning the Eagles exited the tournament unbeaten.

Pape Souaré

Pape N'Diaye Souaré (; born 6 June 1990) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a left back for Premier League club Crystal Palace.

Born in Mbao, Pikine Department, Souaré spent his early career with Diambars, Lille II, Lille and Reims.

He moved to Crystal Palace on a three-and-a half-year deal in January 2015 for an undisclosed fee, reported as £3.45 million. He made his Palace debut on 14 February in the fifth round of the FA Cup, a 2–1 home loss to Liverpool, and was described by Dominic Fifield of "The Observer" as looking "rusty and susceptible".

On 22 January 2016, it was announced that Souaré had signed a new three-and-a half-year contract with Palace. He was sent off on 13 February at the end of a 2–1 loss to Watford at Selhurst Park, for fouling Valon Behrami.

After over a year out of football following a car crash, Souaré made his first appearance on 19 September 2017 in a 1–0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the third round of the EFL Cup. He was praised for his performance by manager Roy Hodgson.

Souaré made his international debut for Senegal on 29 February 2012, in a goalless friendly draw against South Africa at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. He later competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and was a squad member at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. He scored his first international goal from a 20-yard free kick on 29 March 2016 as the "Lions de Teranga" won 2–1 away to Niger in 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. Following his car crash, he returned to the national team in March 2018.

He was not included in Senegal's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 11 September 2016, Souaré was airlifted to hospital after being involved in a road accident on the M4. He sustained injuries to his thigh and jawbone. It was thought that he would be out for 6 months, although he returned to training after 11 months.

Vicente Guaita

Vicente Guaita Panadero (; born 10 January 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Crystal Palace.

He appeared in 176 La Liga matches during eight seasons with Valencia and Getafe, as well as a season on loan with Recreativo in the Segunda División.

Born in Torrent, Valencian Community, Guaita graduated from the Valencia youth system after arriving there from CD Monte-sión at the age of 13, being promoted to the first team for the 2008–09 season following the retirement of longtime incumbent Santiago Cañizares. Additionally, as German Timo Hildebrand became ostracized by coach Unai Emery, he became the backup.

Guaita made his official debut with the main squad on 2 October 2008, in a UEFA Cup tie against Marítimo (2–1 home win). However, after the signing of veteran César Sánchez from Tottenham Hotspur later in the year and the full recovery of Renan, he remained third-choice until the end of the campaign.

In 2009–10, with Sánchez having renewed his link a further year and the signing of Mallorca's Miguel Ángel Moyá, Guaita was deemed surplus to requirements and joined, on loan, Segunda División's Recreativo de Huelva. As the Andalusians finished comfortably in mid-table he was awarded the competition's Ricardo Zamora Trophy, with just 24 goals conceded in 30 appearances.

In November–December 2010, profiting from injuries to both César and Moyà, Guaita had a run of several matches for Valencia, notably a 2–1 home win against Almería in La Liga and a 1–1 draw away to Manchester United for the UEFA Champions League. On 2 April 2011, as he had established himself in the starting XI, he suffered the loss of his father due to a heart attack (aged only 46), prompting manager Emery to reinstate César between the posts for two games.

In May 2011, Guaita extended his contract with Valencia until 2015. He begun the season as the starter, but picked up a serious hand injury in early November 2011, being nonetheless selected to several games by Emery as the reserve.

On 31 July 2014, Guaita was sold to Getafe with a buy-back option. He made his debut for his new team on 24 August, in a 1–3 away loss to Celta.

In the 2016–17 campaign, with the club again in the second level, Guaita played little due to injury. He was, however, the starter in the play-offs, which ended in promotion.

On 2 February 2018, Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Guaita had agreed to join from 1 July on a free transfer. The transfer was reconfirmed by the club on 8 June, with the player joining on a three-year contract. He made his Premier League debut on 15 December, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 home win against Leicester City.

Ryan Inniss

Ryan Stuart Clayton Inniss (born 5 June 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Premier League club Crystal Palace.

An England under-16 and under-17 international, he turned professional at Crystal Palace in 2011. He had a number of loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Luton Town, Gillingham, Yeovil Town, Port Vale, Southend United, Colchester United and Dundee.

Inniss joined the Crystal Palace youth academy at the age of 14 and signed his first professional contract two years later. He captained the club's youth team during the 2012–13 season.

Inniss joined League Two side Cheltenham Town on 1 August 2013 on a month's loan; this was later extended for a further month. "Robins" manager Mark Yates said that Inniss had "been on our radar for six months now". Standing in for the injured Troy Brown, Inniss made his professional debut on 27 August 2013 in Cheltenham's 2–1 League Cup defeat against West Ham United. He impressed, despite suffering a facial injury. He made his first appearance in the English Football League four days later against Bury. On 13 September 2013, Inniss had his loan spell at Cheltenham terminated due to injury. After recovering, he was an unused substitute for Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss to Liverpool in the Premier League on 5 October 2013.

On 10 January 2014, Inniss joined Conference Premier leaders Luton Town on a one-month loan, having been a "number one target" for "Hatters" manager John Still. He scored with his first touch five minutes into his Luton debut in a 2–2 FA Trophy draw with Cambridge United. He returned to Crystal Palace after playing in three matches for the club. On 14 February 2014, he joined League One side Gillingham on a loan deal lasting until the end of the season, making his debut against Sheffield United in a 1–0 defeat. He picked up an injury in the game, which limited him to just two further appearances for the "Gills".

On 16 October 2014, Inniss joined Yeovil Town on a one-month loan deal, later extended until 20 December 2014. "Glovers" manager Gary Johnson had signed him on the recommendation of Tony Pulis. On 29 November, he was sent off for the first time in his career for a two-footed challenge on Kyel Reid in a 2–0 defeat by Preston North End at Huish Park. On 6 January 2015, Inniss returned to Crystal Palace after being recalled from his loan spell at Yeovil having made six appearances.

On 12 February 2015, Inniss joined Port Vale on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut two days later, helping the "Valiants" to keep their first clean sheet in three months with a 1–0 win over Walsall. He collected five yellow cards in five starts during his stay at Vale Park, helping the team to concede just two goals whilst he was on the pitch, but his loan spell was not extended as he damaged his ankle ligaments during his final appearance.

After being linked with a return to Burslem for many weeks, his arrival on loan at Port Vale for the entirety of the 2015–16 season was confirmed on 27 July. He started the 2015–16 season competing with Remie Streete and Richard Duffy for one of two available centre-back places. He was in good form at the start of the campaign, and also managed to significantly improve his disciplinary record. He dislocated his shoulder in September and returned to Selhurst Park for treatment, though his loan deal to Port Vale remained active. He returned to Vale shortly after Christmas. However he picked up a hamstring injury in a home draw with Coventry City on 7 February, and was ruled out of action for three weeks. He returned to Crystal Palace after a re-occurrence of his hamstring injury in a defeat to Barnsley on 28 March. Page described him as "the unluckiest player I think I have ever met with injuries".

On 31 August 2016, he joined League One side Southend United on loan for the rest of the 2016–17 season. He had a difficult start to the campaign, and after returning to Southend following his release from prison he went on to dislocate his shoulder in an FA Cup defeat to Millwall, and was ruled out of action for three months following surgery. On 25 February, he was sent off for two yellow card offences in a 2–1 loss at Gillingham, though manager Phil Brown strongly criticised the decision and said it was "unbelievable refereeing". On 4 April, he dislocated his shoulder for the second time of the season in a 1–0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers at Roots Hall.

On 31 August 2017, he joined League Two side Colchester United on loan for the rest of the 2017–18 season. He made his Colchester debut in a 3–1 win over Crawley Town at the Colchester Community Stadium on 9 September. He made 19 appearances for John McGreal's "U's" across the 2017–18 season.

Inniss made his Crystal Palace debut on 28 August 2018, playing in the entirety of the club's 1–0 win at Swansea City in the EFL Cup. Hr admitted his "surprise" at finally making his senior debut for the club and said "I can only thank those people at the club who have helped me off the field through some tough times". However manager Roy Hodgson he did not name him in his 25-man Premier League squad, and three days later he joined Scottish Premiership side Dundee on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season. He started the season in the "Dens" starting eleven, but fell out of the first-team picture after Jim McIntyre replaced Neil McCann as manager in October. He did manage to force his way back into the team in January, alongside Genséric Kusunga, after Darren O'Dea was suspended and Andrew Davies picked up an injury. However his loan at Dens Park was ended early on 31 January, with Inniss returning to Palace having played 13 games for Dundee.

Inniss has represented England at under-16 and under-17 level. He scored the winning goal in England U16's 2–1 Victory Shield win over Scotland U16 in 2011.

Inniss is eligible to represent Trinidad and Tobago at international level, due to his father being born there.

Inniss had a troubled childhood, as his mother's drug dependency and his father's imprisonment left him to raise his two younger siblings as a teenager. He has three police cautions: one for a public order offence in 2011, one for common assault in August 2015 and one for being drunk and disorderly and resisting a police constable in March 2015. On 9 September 2016, Inniss pleaded guilty to assault following an incident in a bar four months earlier; he was sentenced to 14 weeks in prison. He was released three days later after successfully appealing his sentence, which was suspended for 18 months; he was also handed 240 hours unpaid work, a £300 fine, and ordered to take part in a 20-day alcohol rehabilitation course.

A vocal player, Cheltenham Town centre-back partner Steve Elliott described him as "a typical modern-day centre-half: tall, athletic and aggressive".

Sam Woods

Sam Woods (10 May 1846 – 23 November 1915) was a British trade unionist and politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1890s.

Born at Peasley Cross in St Helens, Woods began working in coal mining at the age of seven. He was elected as a pit checkweighman in 1875 and became strongly involved in trade unionism, joining the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation in 1881. When this merged into the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) in 1889, Woods became the organisation's first vice president.

In the 1892 general election, Woods was elected as a Lib–Lab MP for Ince. In Parliament, he agitated for the Eight Hours Bill, and in 1894 he was elected as the Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

Jaïro Riedewald

Jaïro Jocquim Riedewald (born 9 September 1996) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a defender or midfielder for English side Crystal Palace.

On 15 March 2013, Riedewald signed his first professional contract with Ajax, a product of the Ajax Youth Academy having joined the club from SV Overbos at the age of 11. His first contract with the club was a three-year contract binding him to the club until 2016. On 21 December 2013 he made his professional debut in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands, playing for the reserves team Jong Ajax, in a match against VVV-Venlo which ended in a 5–1 away loss.

On 14 December 2013, Ajax head coach Frank de Boer announced the inclusion of Riedewald in the first team squad for the away match against SC Cambuur on 15 December 2013. Not having made an appearance in that fixture it was the first time he was called for the first team. He made his debut for the first team on 19 December 2013 in the KNVB Cup match against IJsselmeervogels. The match ended in a 3–0 away win, with Riedewald coming on for Daley Blind in the 73rd minute of the match. Three days later he made his Eredivisie debut against Roda JC Kerkrade. After Bojan Krkić, Riedewald was substituted on as well in the 80th minute, where he replaced Christian Poulsen, quickly scoring two goals, after trailing 1–0, helping Ajax to a 2–1 away victory, hereby becoming the youngest scoring debutant in the club and league history with 17 years, 104 days. The youngest scoring player before him in the Dutch Eredivise was Jeroen Lumu with 17 years, 111 days, while Marco van Basten was the youngest scoring debutant at the club with 17 year, 154 days of age.

Since January 2014 Riedewald became a permanent member of the first team at Ajax. On 27 February 2014, Riedewald made his continental debut for Ajax in the UEFA Europa League away match against Red Bull Salzburg which resulted in a 3–1 loss where he replaced Christian Poulsen in the 63rd minute.

After Niklas Moisander departed the club at the start of the 2015-16 season, Ajax manager Frank de Boer decided to choose Riedewald as the new partner of Joël Veltman in central defense. In de Klassieker against Feyenoord on 7 February 2016, Riedewald got injured soon after kick-off; he had broken his left ankle, which meant his season was finished. Until that moment, he had only missed one league game due to suspension. He returned early from injury on 1 May 2016, replacing Kenny Tete in the 76th minute in a match against FC Twente.

After Ajax lost the Eredivisie title to PSV on the last matchday of the season by drawing to De Graafschap, manager De Boer decided to leave the club. His successor Peter Bosz decided to use Riedewald more as a defensive midfielder during the opening of the season. On 15 September 2016, Riedewald scored the rebound of Davy Klaassen's missed penalty in a Europa League match against Panathinaikos, his first goal for Ajax since his debut match.

In July 2017, Riedewald signed a five-year contract with Premier League side Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee.

Riedewald received his first call up to the senior Netherlands team in August 2015. On September 6, he made his official debut for Oranje against Turkey.

Born in Haarlem, Riedewald is of mixed Dutch, Surinamese and Indonesian heritage. His father hails from Suriname, while his mother is of half Dutch, half Indonesian descent. This was revealed in an interview with Riedewald prior to the off-season tour of Indonesia in 2014 by AFC Ajax of Holland.

Jarosław Jach

Jarosław Przemysław Jach (born 17 February 1994) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Sheriff Tiraspol of the Moldovan National Division, on loan from club Crystal Palace.

Although his mother Lucyna originally wanted him to be a swimmer, young Jarosław always was more of a football fan. He started his career in a local club Pogoń Pieszyce, where he played until his friend helped him earn a transfer to Lechia Dzierżoniów. With time he established himself as one of the most important figures in the club and was often chosen as captain of the team and took free kicks even though he wasn't even 20 years old.

He signed with Zagłębie Lubin in 2013 and after a year of playing in the reserve team, he made his debut in Polish top division on May 27, 2014 against Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała, coming on as substitute for Đorđe Čotra in 74th minute of the match.

The club eventually got relegated and started the 2014–15 season in second division. Jach made 13 appearances, helping the side to promotion.

In 2015–16 season, he scored his first goal in a 2-1 win over Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała on 22 November 2015. He helped his team to win a bronze medal in that season.

In the 2016–17 season and the departure of Maciej Dąbrowski to Legia Warsaw, he became a regular starter for Zagłębie and proved to be a crucial part of the team's defense, which turned out to be the 5th in the league. A series of performances however, was stopped by an injury which caused him to pause for 3 months.

Jach signed for Premier League club Crystal Palace on 23 January 2018 on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

In July 2018, Jach joined Turkish Süper Lig side Çaykur Rizespor on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season, though his loan was ended early, in February 2019, after he made only five league appearances for the side.

Following his departure from Rizespor, Jach joined Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol on loan.

Jason Puncheon

Jason David Ian Puncheon (born 18 June 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Huddersfield Town, on loan from Crystal Palace.

Following his goal against Everton on his Blackpool debut, he has scored in all of the top four divisions of English league football, scoring for Barnet in League Two, Milton Keynes Dons and Southampton in League One, Millwall in the Championship and Blackpool, Southampton and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

Born in Croydon, Greater London, Puncheon began his career with Wimbledon, and moved with the team to Milton Keynes, where the club became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. He was released in January 2006. He moved to Barnet in June of the same year, after brief spells with Fisher Athletic and Lewes. He was named FA Cup Player of the Third Round in 2007 and the following season after scoring a succession of brilliant goals (including a last minute 35-yard free kick versus Bradford) was named in the PFA Team of the Season.

Plymouth Argyle signed Puncheon from Barnet for £250,000 in 2008. He endured an unsuccessful 18-month spell at the club, making six league appearances. He was loaned to former club MK Dons three times in two years, where he scored 11 goals in 51 appearances.

On 30 January 2010, Puncheon joined Southampton which then led to his loan deal at MK Dons to be cut short. He scored his first goal in a 5–1 victory over Walsall, and scored again a few days later, in a 5–0 victory over Huddersfield.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, he was a regular in the first team. However, when Alan Pardew lost his job just days after a 4–0 win away to Bristol Rovers, Southampton hired Nigel Adkins as manager. Under Adkins, he stayed in the first team, but found himself under increasing pressure from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his place. Eventually Adkins lost patience with Puncheon's erratic performances, and dropped him to the bench in favour of 17-year-old Chamberlain, who was later sold to Arsenal for a reported £15m. On 16 November 2010, Puncheon moved on an emergency loan deal to Millwall. He scored his first goal on his first game for Millwall in their 1–0 victory over Middlesbrough. On 1 January 2011, Puncheon scored a hat-trick in the 3–0 victory over Crystal Palace.

On 31 January 2011, Puncheon joined Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut, scoring a goal, at Everton on 5 February. He scored his second goal against Chelsea on 7 March at Bloomfield Road. Puncheon re-joined the Saints after Blackpool's failed attempt to fight off relegation. On 31 August 2011, Puncheon joined Queens Park Rangers on loan until 2 January 2012.

He returned to the Saints after his unsuccessful loan spell at QPR, but on 21 January 2012, he publicly criticised Executive chairman Nicola Cortese. However just days later, it was revealed that Puncheon had apologised to Cortese and would be available for selection in the first team. He then started the next two matches: a 1–1 draw in the FA Cup at Millwall and a 1–1 draw in the Championship against Cardiff City.

He scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season with a 30-yard volley in a league cup win at Stevenage. He scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton in a 4–1 home victory against Aston Villa. His second came when Southampton won 3–1 away to Queens Park Rangers. He scored his third Premier League goal in the 61st minute against Reading to secure Southampton a vital 1–0 victory and move them out of the relegation zone. His fourth was scored to give Southampton a 2–2 draw away to the Champions of Europe Chelsea. On 9 February 2013, he scored his fifth in Southampton's 3–1 home win against 2011–12 champions Manchester City.

On 1 March 2013, Puncheon signed a new contract with Southampton, expiring in 2016.

On 21 August 2013, Puncheon signed a one-year loan with Crystal Palace. He missed a penalty as Palace lost 2–0 away to Tottenham Hotspur on 11 January 2014, but made up for his miss by scoring the only goal of their 1–0 win against Stoke City the following weekend. On 31 January 2014, Puncheon made his loan spell into a permanent move, for a fee of around £1.75m. Puncheon's three goals in January and a further three in back-to-back wins in April that lifted Palace away from the relegation zone, led boss Tony Pulis to issue a 'hands off' warning to other clubs interesting in signing Puncheon.

On 16 August 2014, in Palace's first match of the new season away to Arsenal, Puncheon took a corner which was headed in by Brede Hangeland for the first goal of the game. He was sent off for his second booking in the 89th minute, after which Arsenal scored their winning goal. On 17 January 2015, Puncheon scored his third goal of the season and second in as many games against Burnley in a 3–2 away win. Crystal Palace had come from 2 goals down to claim victory to boost their survival hopes. Palace manager Alan Pardew heaped praise on Puncheon's performance, describing him as "the best player on the pitch by a country mile." 

On 6 April 2015, Puncheon scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace against Manchester City. Puncheon's goal came from a freekick which went past Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart. He opened the scoring in the 2016 FA Cup Final against Manchester United with a goal in the 78th minute, but Palace went on to lose the match 2–1 after extra time.

On 18 July 2017, Puncheon replaced Scott Dann as captain. In January 2018, manager Roy Hodgson announced that Puncheon would play no further part in the 2017–18 season following a cruciate ligament injury sustained while playing against Manchester City.

On 4 January 2019, Puncheon signed for Premier League club Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season.

Puncheon is of Jamaican descent and is eligible for the Jamaica national football team.

In December 2017, Puncheon was arrested and charged with possession of an offensive weapon, common assault, and a public order offence of "causing fear or provocation of violence" after a fight outside a nightclub in Reigate. On 5 January 2018, Puncheon appeared in court where he denied the charge of assault. The charge of possessing an offensive weapon was withdrawn and he was bailed to appear again in court on 4 June. He later changed his plea to guilty and was given a community order requiring him to carry out 210 hours of unpaid work, and pay the doorman involved £250 compensation.
