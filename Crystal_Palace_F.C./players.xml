'''Julián Maria Speroni''' ({{IPA-es|xuˈljan espeˈɾoni}}; born 18 May 1979) is an Argentine [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Having begun his career at [[Club Atlético Platense|Platense]], he played three seasons in the [[Scottish Premier League]] with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] before joining Crystal Palace for £750,000 in 2004. He has played 400 matches across all competitions for his current club.

==Club career==
===Dundee===
Speroni was born in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; He started his career with [[Club Atlético Platense]], in his homeland, but moved after just one year as a professional and two matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistaeldiego.net/2012/12/julian-speroni-conquistador-silencioso.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141029131030/http://www.revistaeldiego.net/2012/12/julian-speroni-conquistador-silencioso.html |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]. Dundee manager [[Ivano Bonetti]] received advice from an Italian contact to Speroni's potential. The move to Dundee was delayed for two months, due to administration delays in Argentina, holding up Speroni's application for an Italian passport.&lt;ref name="Interview with Speroni 2002"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+I+OWE+EVERYTHING+TO+IVANO.-a0102435273 Interview with Speroni 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===

He signed for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], newly promoted to the [[Premier League]], on 13 July 2004, for a fee of around £750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speroni joins Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/3811683.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speroni made his debut for Palace against Everton in a three goals to one defeat. Speroni only started the first six games for his newly promoted team in their Premier League campaign, before he was replaced by Hungarian international [[Gábor Király]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

His first three seasons at [[Selhurst Park]] saw him largely play understudy to Király who made the goalkeeping spot his own. This was until the Hungarian departed Selhurst Park at the end of the 2006–07 season. Back in the line-up Speroni flourished and won his reputation back.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Palace managed to reach the play-offs with Speroni earning a new three-year contract at the end of the 2007–08 season and the club's "[[Crystal Palace F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]]" award. At the end of the following season, he retained Palace's "Player of the Year" award.

In the 2009–10 season, Speroni again drew praise. Like at Dundee, his club fell into financial difficulty, and finished the season in administration. This meant a ten-point deduction, and survival was only secured on the final day of the season. For his role in this, Speroni was given a new record, becoming the first man to win Palace's "Player of the Year" award for three consecutive years. Then on 10 December 2010, Speroni agreed a 3 1⁄2 year extension to his current contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speroni commits to Palace|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11706/6565971/speroni-commits-to-palace|publisher=Sky Sports|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Speroni was named Player of the Year for the fourth time.&lt;ref name="POTY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/may/speroni-lands-fourth-player-of-the-year-award/|title=Speroni Lands Fourth Player of the Year Award|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=6 May 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418225344/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/may/speroni-lands-fourth-player-of-the-year-award/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract expired early into 2014 and he subsequently negotiated contract offers with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premier League clubs submit retained and released lists |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504185633/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |archivedate= 4 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julian Speroni could leave Crystal Palace|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/466697/Julian-Speroni-could-leave-Crystal-Palace|publisher=Daily Express|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2014 Crystal Palace announced that Speroni had signed a new contract with the club for 12 months with a further 12 month option. Speroni is much loved by the Crystal Palace fans and has become a cult hero at the club being named the supporters' player of the season on four separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/june/speroni-signs-new-contract/|title=Speroni Signs New Contract|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418224142/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/june/speroni-signs-new-contract/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speroni was rewarded for his years of service to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] with a Testimonial match against [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on 26 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/dundee-to-play-in-speroni-testimonial|title=DUNDEE TO PLAY IN SPERONI TESTIMONIAL|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418223255/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/dundee-to-play-in-speroni-testimonial|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speroni made his 347th league appearance for the club, breaking [[John Jackson (footballer, born 1942)|John Jackson]]'s record as the team's goalkeeper with the most league appearances, against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/february/speroni-breaks-league-record/|title=Speroni Breaks League Record|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418224724/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/february/speroni-breaks-league-record/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, prior to the testimonial, Speroni was inducted into the [[Dundee F.C.#Hall of Fame|Dundee Hall of Fame]] picking up the International Award which was previously won by fellow countryman [[Claudio Caniggia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/the-2015-dundee-fc-hall-of-fame-2|title=2015 Dundee FC Hall of Fame 2|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=28 March 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418223911/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/the-2015-dundee-fc-hall-of-fame-2|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, Speroni signed a one-year contract extension at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to keep him at the club until at least the end of the [[2015-16 Premier League|2015–16 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speroni Extends Eagles Stay|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/may/speroni-extends-eagles-stay/|publisher=Crystal Palace|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped to third-choice goalkeeper in that season, behind [[Wayne Hennessey]] and [[Alex McCarthy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Pardew reveals why he dropped this Crystal Palace ace|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/500256/Alan-Pardew-Crystal-Palace-FA-Cup-Julian-Speroni-Premier-League-fans-right-to-criticise|publisher=Daily Star|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still played 2 league games, including the league match against [[Southampton F.C.]] in the final day of the season, when he equaled [[John Jackson (footballer, born 1942)|John Jackson]]’s club appearance record as a goalkeeper in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaney and Speroni Sign New Deals|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/june/delaney-and-speroni-sign-new-deals/|publisher=Crystal Palace|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed another one-year contract extension on 13 June 2016 to remain with the club until the end of [[2016-17 Premier League|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace duo Julian Speroni and Damien Delaney sign new one-year deals|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36520014|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2017 he was named a starter in Palace's match day squad again, helping them to a 2–1 win over defending champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/october/match-report-for-crystal-palace-vs-chelsea-on-14-oct-17/|title=Crystal Palace FC Report: Crystal Palace 2–1 Chelsea|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

In November 1998, Speroni was named in the squad for a friendly against Japan U20 in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La nómina del Sub 21|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/117437-la-nomina-del-sub-21|publisher=La Nacion|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=11 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, he was called into the Argentina U20 pre-selection squad for the [[1999 South American U-20 Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farías y Duscher se agregaron al plantel|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/12/27/r-06601d.htm|publisher=clarin.com|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=27 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina's under 20 team played friendlies against Hungary and Denmark. On 30 December [[José Pékerman]] did not name him in the final squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ya está la lis20|url=http://pdf.diariohoy.net/1998/12/30/cla6y7.pdf|publisher=diariohoy.net|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=30 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307004221/http://pdf.diariohoy.net/1998/12/30/cla6y7.pdf|archive-date=7 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speroni made one appearance for the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina U20]] team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11706/9163143/crystal-palace-goalkeeper-julian-speroni-targets-argentina-place&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Speroni also holds an Italian passport, for which he qualified through his grandfather.&lt;ref name="Interview with Speroni 2002"/&gt;

Speroni owned a restaurant in [[Purley, London|Purley]], south London that was named 'Speroni's.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace keeper Julian Speroni opens new restaurant|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Crystal-Palace-keeper-Julian-Speroni-opens-new/story-20521896-detail/story.html|publisher=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=29 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302014112/http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Crystal-Palace-keeper-Julian-Speroni-opens-new/story-20521896-detail/story.html|archive-date=2 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant closed in October 2016 following "structural issues" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace legend Julian Speroni reveals why his Purley restaurant closed down|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/8203-more-detail-revealed-about-why-julian-speroni-s-restaurant-closed-down/story-30016499-detail/story.html|publisher=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Aanholt was first selected for Chelsea in an [[FA Cup]] tie away to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the [[FA Cup 2009–10|2009–10]] edition of the Cup, wearing the squad number 52, but did not make an appearance, remaining on the bench.

He provided cover for the Spaniard, sustaining Newcastle's productive left flank alongside [[Jonás Gutiérrez]]. Van Aanholt played his last game in the 1–2 away victory at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

Van Aanholt scored his first career goal on 22 September 2010 in the 4–3 defeat to former club Newcastle in the [[2010–11 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307975&amp;cc=5739|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926130707/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307975&amp;cc=5739|archivedate=26 September 2010|title=Ameobi sends Chelsea crashing out|date=22 September 2010|work=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 2011, he joined [[Leicester City F.C|Leicester City]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_6703047,00.html | title=Foxes clinch Van Aanholt loan |work=Sky Sports | date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 1–0 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 1 February 2011,&lt;ref name="Sheff Utd   0 - 1   Leicester"&gt;{{cite news|title = Sheff Utd 0 – 1 Leicester|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/9379936.stm|publisher = BBC Sport|date = 1 February 2011|accessdate = 1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered a torn muscle in his thigh at the end of the month after playing six games.&lt;ref name="Leicester's Patrick van Aanholt set to miss a month"&gt;{{cite news|title = Leicester's Patrick van Aanholt set to miss a month|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/9410062.stm|publisher = BBC Sport|date = 28 February 2011|accessdate = 1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Aanholt scored his first senior league goal in a 4–0 victory over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 9 April 2011.&lt;ref name="Report: Leicester City 4 Burnley 0"&gt;{{cite news|title = Leicester City vs Burnley|url = http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~52285,00.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110413061448/http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~52285,00.html|archivedate = 13 April 2011|publisher = Leicester City F.C.|date = 9 April 2011|accessdate = 9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2012, Milivojević scored an impressive goal against city rivals [[FK Partizan|Partizan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.blic.rs/Fudbal/Domaci-fudbal/223658/Milivojevic-Ceo-zivot-sam-sanjao-i-molio-Boga-da-dam-gol-Partizanu] Blic Sport: Milivojević: Ceo život sam sanjao i molio Boga da dam gol Partizanu {{sr icon}} 18 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anderlecht===
On 26 July 2013, Milivojević signed a five-year contract with [[Belgian]] football giants [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/anderlecht/transfer-talk/news/milivojevic-joins-anderlecht_95417.html] Sports Mole: Milivojević joins Anderlecht (28 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2014, it was announced that Milivojević had joined [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] on loan from Anderlecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympiacos.org/article/40270/sta-%C2%ABerythroleyka%C2%BB-o-milibogebits|script-title=el:Στα «ερυθρόλευκα» ο Μιλιβόγεβιτς|date=1 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|language=Greek|publisher=Olympiacos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2014–15 season, Milivojević reiterated his desire to stay with Olympiacos. The two clubs could have started new negotiations after the season ended; Milivojević stated that his wish was to make the move permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/30944/milivojevic-wants-to-commit-his-future-to-olympiakos/|title=Milivojević wants to commit his future to Olympiakos|date=19 April 2015|publisher=www.sdna.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports in Belgium, Olympiacos were to meet Anderlecht's asking price in order to complete the permanent transfer of Milivojević. Olympiacos were in negotiations with the Belgian club as they were reluctant to pay the €2.7 million Anderlecht asked for Milivojević.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/31165/olympiakos-poised-to-activate-milivojevic-buy-out-clause/|title=Olympiakos poised to activate Milivojevic buy-out clause|date=20 April 2015|publisher=www.sdna.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had spent a season with the club, and joined the Greek champions by signing a four-year contract, for a fee of €2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lameuse.be/1303542/article/2015-06-04/anderlecht-cede-definitivement-luka-milivojevic-a-olympiacos|title=Anderlecht cède définitivement Luka Milivojevic à Olympiacos |date=4 June 2015|publisher=www.lameuse.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympiacos.org/article/48508/thrylos-kai-milibogebits-synexizoyn-mazi|title=Θρύλος και Μιλιβόγεβιτς συνεχίζουν μαζί!|date=4 June 2015|publisher=www.olympiacos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/synexizei-ston-olympiako-o-milivogevits.3509826.html|title=Μιλιβόγεβιτς ως το 2019|date=4 June 2015|publisher=www.sport24.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2015, Olympiacos turned down a bid in the region of €5 million from [[Fenerbahce]].

===Crystal Palace===
[[File:Manchester United v Crystal Palace, 30 September 2017 (12).jpg|thumb|Milivojević in action against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]]]
On 31 January 2017, Milivojević signed for Crystal Palace on a three-and-a-half year contract for almost €16 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milivojevic Joins The Eagles|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/january/milivojevic-joins-the-eagles/|publisher=Crystal Palace Official Site|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 2017, he scored his first goal for Palace with a penalty kick in his team's 3–0 home win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/apr/10/crystal-palace-v-arsenal-premier-league-live|title=Crystal Palace v Arsenal: Premier League – live!|last=Butler|first=Michael|date=10 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and got his other goal of the season on 14 May in a 4–0 win at [[Selhurst Park]] against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], which secured his team's place in the top flight for next season and relegated the opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Neil |title=Crystal Palace 4–0 Hull City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39833968 |accessdate=11 March 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Dann''' (born 14 February 1987) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He began his [[Football League]] career with [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], before moving on to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and then to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2009. After Birmingham's relegation from the Premier League, Dann joined Blackburn in August 2011 and was the club's captain.

==Early life==
Dann was born in [[Liverpool]], Merseyside,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and attended Archbishop Beck High School in the [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] district of the city. He is a former [[Liverpool F.C.]] season ticket holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-considering-move-birmingham-3375863 |title=Liverpool FC considering move for Birmingham City defender Scott Dann |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Walsall===
Dann joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in 2003 as a junior after impressing on trial at the [[Bescot Stadium]], signing a professional contract with the Saddlers the following year. He moved up the ranks at Walsall to become a regular in the reserve team throughout 2004–05 and was allowed to join Danish side [[Køge BK]] on loan towards the end of the campaign.

Dann then joined [[Conference North]] side [[Redditch United F.C.|Redditch United]] on loan in October 2005 initially until the end of the season, but he was recalled in January 2006. He then Joined Redditch's league rivals [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]] on loan following injuries to their regular centre-backs Richard Teesdale and Ian Wright. He played in three games for the Pitmen, against [[Hucknall Town F.C.|Hucknall Town]], [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]] and [[Lancaster City F.C.|Lancaster City]], before injury put an end to his loan spell at [[Keys Park]]. He returned to Walsall and was put on a short-term contract for the 2006–07 season, where he earned his place in the starting line-up with a number of excellent performances at the back. His season was ended in March 2007 after picking up a metatarsal injury in the game against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].

As reward for his outstanding season for the Saddlers, who were promoted as League Two Champions, Dann was given a three-year contract to commit him to the club and to ward off interest from a number of clubs higher up in the league.

===Coventry City===
His form in League One was equally as impressive as the previous season, so it was little surprise that in January 2008 Dann joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for an undisclosed fee, suggested in the media to be "in excess of £1 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scott-dann-follows-fox-to-coventry-57533 |title=Scott Dann follows Fox to Coventry from Walsall |first=Brian |last=Halford |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His impressive form for the Saddlers continued in the Championship for the Sky Blues alongside former Walsall teammate [[Daniel Fox (footballer)|Daniel Fox]], who had also moved to the [[Ricoh Arena]]. He helped the club narrowly avoid relegation. The England set-up had seen enough in Dann and Fox to decide they were ready to make the step up to international level, with both players making their U-21 debuts in March 2008 against Poland at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]].

Dann was appointed [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of Coventry City for the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/scott-dann-named-coventry-city-3093103 |title=Scott Dann is named Coventry City captain |first=Andy |last=Turner |newspaper=Coventry Telegraph |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Kouyaté began his footballing career in 1996 in his hometown with ASC Yego Dakar and was scouted by [[RWDM Brussels FC|RWDM Brussels]] in September 2006. RWDM Brussels then signed the player in January the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html FC BRUSSELS Players] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430152814/http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html |date=30 April 2009 }} on www.rwdm-brussels.be&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play ten league appearances for the first team between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="whufc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |title=CHEIKHOU KOUYATE |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115021426/http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |archivedate=15 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anderlecht===
As Kouyaté turned 19, he left Brussels because his former employers did not pay him three months' worth of wages. He subsequently moved to Belgian rivals [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] on a four-year deal for a free transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=T31U96TG Cheikhou Kouyaté moet van de rechter naar Anderlecht] on www.nieuwsblad.be&lt;/ref&gt; After a loan to KV Kortrijk, he returned to Anderlecht.

'''Andros Darryl Townsend''' (born 16 July 1991) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|CrystalP}} club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

A graduate of the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Reserves and Academy|academy]] and featuring in various England youth teams, Townsend was initially loaned out to several [[EFL League One|League One]] and then [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs alongside limited Tottenham appearances, before gaining his Premier League debut on 16 September 2012. After further limited appearances and then a half-season loan to Premier League club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], Townsend established himself as a Tottenham player for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. He subsequently fell out of favour at Tottenham, and following a short spell at Newcastle United in the 2015–16 season, he transferred to Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016.

In his senior international career, Townsend earned his first England cap on 11 October 2013, and has gone on to make thirteen appearances, scoring three goals.

==Early career==
Townsend joined the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] academy at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2456592/Andros-Townsend-dedicated-England-debut-memory-late-brother.html |title=Tragedy that drives England's new star&amp;nbsp;– Townsend dedicates Wembley heroics to memory of his brother Kurtis |author1=Higgs, Peter |author2=Miller, Alex |last-author-amp=yes |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=12 October 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, he went on loan to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/y/yeovil/7952653.stm |title=Yeovil sign teenage Tottenham duo |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090322135753/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/y/yeovil/7952653.stm| archivedate= 22 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; making his football league debut against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] alongside fellow Spurs academy player [[Jonathan Obika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7937330.stm |title=Yeovil 0–0 MK Dons |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323074638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7937330.stm| archivedate= 23 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made ten appearances and scored one goal for Yeovil as they avoided relegation.&lt;ref name=THFCResProfile&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106142845/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/players/reserves/androstownsend.html |title=Professional Player Profiles: Andros Townsend |archivedate=6 January 2011 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/players/reserves/androstownsend.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
====Initial loans====
Townsend entered the senior Tottenham team under manager [[Harry Redknapp]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In August 2009, he went on a month's loan to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], extended at the end of the month to the end of December, after which he returned to Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808145732/http://www.leytonorient.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10439~1745442%2C00.html |url=http://www.leytonorient.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10439~1745442,00.html |title=O's take Spurs youngster on loan |date=6 August 2009 |archivedate= 8 August 2009 |publisher=Leyton Orient F.C |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-extends-loan-310809/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros extends loan |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 26 appearances for Orient, Townsend scored twice, including a "great goal" in a 3–3 draw against Yeovil, passing three opposing players with a run that began in his own half, leading the opposition manager to lament that his players had not been more ruthless and taken him down with a professional foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8207704.stm |title=Yeovil 3–3 Leyton Orient |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having not yet made his Tottenham debut, on 14 January 2010, Townsend was again taken on loan by a League One club, Milton Keynes Dons, until the end of the season, although he was recalled after just two months due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-recalled-050310/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros recalled |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nine matches for the Dons he had scored twice.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The season ended without Townsend having made his debut for Tottenham.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On 12 August 2010, Townsend signed another season-long loan, moving up to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] level with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], but this was terminated on 20 December, as Redknapp believed he had not been playing regularly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Tottenham-pull-Andros-Townsend-out-of-his-Ipswich-loan-because-of-a-lack-of-game-time-article654939.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |title=Redknapp pulls youngster out of Ipswich loan |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-loan-to-ipswich-120810/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros loan to Ipswich |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had played 16 times, scoring once.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On 9 January 2011, Townsend marked his senior Tottenham debut in a third round FA Cup tie at [[White Hart Lane]] against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], scoring the first goal and being voted [[Man of the Match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/8786154.Watford_still_hope_to_sign_Spurs__Townsend/ |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |title=Watford still hopeful of signing Tottenham winger Andros Townsend |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be his only appearance for Tottenham for the rest of the season, with two further loan spells occurring.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He joined Championship club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 20 January 2011 on loan until the end of the season, but this was terminated early, on 23 February, with Townsend having made three appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-in-watford-loan-200111/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros in Watford loan |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/9405798.stm |title=Watford's Kiernan joins Wycombe, Townsend leaves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March, Townsend again went on loan to a Championship club until the end of the season, this time [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/9417132.stm |title=Millwall sign Tottenham Hotspur winger Andros Townsend |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April he said he would be happy to stay at the club beyond his loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/millwall/8441390/Tottenham-Hotspur-winger-Andros-Townsend-keen-to-stay-at-Millwall-after-fine-display-in-victory-over-Leeds.html |title=Tottenham Hotspur winger Andros Townsend keen to stay at Millwall after fine display in victory over Leeds |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 appearances he scored twice.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====European football and further loans====
For the first half of Tottenham's [[2011–12 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Townsend was a regular in their [[2011-12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League campaign]], making six appearances in the competition, scoring his second goal for the club in their final match in the competition against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 15 December 2011, curling in a shot from outside the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/15/tottenham-hotspur-shamrock-rovers-europa-league| title=Tottenham thrash Shamrock Rovers but exit Europa League| first=Declan |last=Warrington|newspaper=The Guardian
|location=London |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December, he signed a contract extension, making him a Tottenham player until the end of the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11675/7391922/Townsend-signs-Spurs-extension| title=Townsend signs Spurs extension| publisher=Sky Sports| date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With only one other appearance for Tottenham, in the League Cup, on 1 January 2012, Townsend joined Championship club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on loan until the end of the season, but with his agent claiming he was unhappy at the club, he switched the loan to their Championship rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107201730/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120101/tottenham-star-joins-united_2247585_2562839| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120101/tottenham-star-joins-united_2247585_2562839| title=Tottenham star joins United| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=1 January 2012 |archivedate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2622625,00.html |title=Andros wings in |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=24 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227080705/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10412~2622625%2C00.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17157791 |title=Andros Townsend joins Birmingham on loan after leaving Leeds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Leeds, he made seven appearances, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, and scored one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108054655/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120104/leeds-decision-was-no-brainer-for-andros_2247585_2565206| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120104/leeds-decision-was-no-brainer-for-andros_2247585_2565206| title=Leeds decision was 'no brainer' for Andros| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=4 January 2012 |archivedate=8 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/match-report/match/1120008| title=Luc's late, late winner for Leeds!| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Birmingham, he made 16 league appearances, including in their second leg tie in the [[2012 Football League play-offs|unsuccessful Championship promotion playoff]] against Blackpool.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Premier League debut====
Townsend remained with Tottenham for the first half of their [[2012–13 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2012–13 season]], with the club now under a new manager, [[André Villas-Boas]], who replaced Redknapp in the summer. He made his Premier League debut with a late substitution appearance on 16 September.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Although appearing a further four times in the Premier League, these were all still late substitute appearances.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Outside the league he made a further five appearances, once in the League Cup and FA Cup respectively, and three times in the Europa League.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored his third Tottenham goal in the League Cup, a fine individual effort in a 3–0 victory against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/26/tottenham-hotspur-carlisle |title=Tottenham's understudies excel in audition and outclass bold Carlisle |first=Louise |last=Taylor |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Queens Park Rangers====
On 31 January 2013, Townsend followed Redknapp to Premier League club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a loan deal until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21285005 |title=Jermaine Jenas completes move from Tottenham to QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made twelve appearances for the club, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, scoring two goals in March, a dipping volley from outside the penalty area in a 3–1 win at home to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and an equalising deflection in a 3–2 away loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/9842206/QPR-v-Norwich-City-live.html |title=QPR v Norwich City: live |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2 February 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21639329 |title=QPR 3–1 Sunderland |author=Sanghera, Mandeep |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21724358 |title=Aston Villa 3–2 QPR | last = Monaghan | first = Matt |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; QPR were ultimately relegated, and Townsend returned to his parent club.

Now back at Tottenham, Townsend started the second Premier League match of their [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2013–14 season]], and went on to make a total of 33 appearances, including 25 in the league.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored twice, in a 5–0 away victory over [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in the Europa League (his first match of the season), and his first in the Premier League in a 2–0 victory away to Aston Villa on 20 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23707596 |title=Dinamo Tbilisi 0–5 Tottenham | last = Magowan | first = Alistair |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24510366 | title = Aston Villa 0–2 Tottenham | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 20 October 2013 | accessdate = 9 November 2013 | first = Phil | last = McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the season, Townsend came under the management of his third Tottenham boss, after Villas-Boas was replaced by [[Tim Sherwood]].

With Sherwood's contract terminated at the end of the season, Townsend started the club's [[2014–15 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2014–15 season]] under new manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]]. He made a total of 35 appearances, scoring 5 goals, but was reduced to just 17 appearances in the league, having been unable to hold down a starting place until the second half of the season.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news |title=Merson tells Andros Townsend to 'win some medals' as Twitter fallout rolls on|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/2376873/paul-merson-tells-andros-townsend-to-win-some-medals-as-twitter-fallout-continues |publisher=ESPN |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started as Tottenham lost 2–0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 1 March.&lt;ref name=2015LC&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Chelsea 2–0 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31572594 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Out of favour====
On 4 November 2015, having not started a league match of the [[2015–16 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2015–16 season]], Townsend was dropped from the squad following a touchline argument with the club's fitness coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34725197 | title = Spurs drop Andros Townsend after row with coach Nathan Gardiner | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 4 November 2015 | accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having apologised, Pochettino allowed Townsend to return to the squad by 17 November, and stated the matter was over and he was available for selection again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='We feel sorry for him' Pochettino's injury set-back ahead of West Ham |url=http://www.london24.com/sport/football/clubs/tottenham/we_feel_sorry_for_him_pochettino_s_injury_set_back_ahead_of_west_ham_1_4319706 |work=London 24 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202180057/http://www.london24.com/sport/football/clubs/tottenham/we_feel_sorry_for_him_pochettino_s_injury_set_back_ahead_of_west_ham_1_4319706 |archivedate=2 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He never made a first team appearance for Tottenham following the incident, being an unused substitute three times, the last time on 10 December.&lt;ref name=newcastle&gt;{{Cite news|title = Andros Townsend completes £12m Newcastle move from Tottenham|url = http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/10145700/andros-townsend-completes-newcastle-medical-ahead-of-16312m-move-from-tottenham|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
[[File:Townsend 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Townsend playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2016]]

On 26 January 2016, having still not started a league match, Tottenham agreed a transfer fee with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for Townsend, reportedly £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35409021 | title = Andros Townsend: Newcastle agree fee with Tottenham | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 26 January 2016 | accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fee had been announced, Townsend had already tweeted a goodbye message, and stated "As soon as I knew of Newcastle's interest they were the only club I wanted to join...Two of the best positions you can play in football are centre-forward and left wing at Newcastle. I've got the chance. I could never turn that down. I can't wait to play my first game at [[St James' Park]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Townsend to Newcastle: 'They were the only club I wanted to join'|url = https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/andros-townsend-to-newcastle-they-were-the-only-club-i-wanted-to-join-says-departing-tottenham-a3165371.html|newspaper=London Evening Standard|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was confirmed the following day, a five-and-a-half-year contract but with the club declining to disclose the fee. On signing, his new manager, Newcastle head coach [[Steve McClaren]], said of Townsend that he is a "winger with an old-fashioned style. He can play on the right or the left, is two-footed, quick, very direct and loves taking on defenders and crossing the ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Newcastle sign Andros Townsend|url = http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160127/newcastle-sign-andros-townsend_2281670_5304402|publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sky Sports, the transfer had been under negotiation for a week and Newcastle had initially wanted Townsend on loan, and then had a transfer offer of £10.5m rejected.&lt;ref name=newcastle/&gt;

Despite his debut for Newcastle being in a disappointing team performance in an away defeat, at the next match, his home debut, he was given a standing ovation after a Man of the Match performance which saw Newcastle climb out of the relegation places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Everton 3–0 Newcastle United|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35416325|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 6 February 2016|first = Patrick Jennings BBC|last = Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Newcastle United 1–0 West Bromwich Albion|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35447662|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 6 February 2016|first = Saj Chowdhury BBC|last = Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for the club came in his third match, a shot from just outside the area, but it was just a 90th minute consolation goal in a 5–1 away defeat to Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Chelsea 5–1 Newcastle United|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35510139|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 13 February 2016|first = Chris|last = Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
[[File:Andros Townsend 16-07-2016 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Townsend playing for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2016]]

On 1 July 2016, Townsend joined Premier League club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a five-year contract from Newcastle following their relegation to the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36680273 |title=Crystal Palace sign Andros Townsend and Steve Mandanda |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace triggered his £13&amp;nbsp;million release clause just six months after he joined from Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12691/10329590/andros-townsend-set-for-crystal-palace-medical-after-16313m-newcastle-release-clause-triggered |title=Andros Townsend set for Crystal Palace medical after £13m Newcastle release clause triggered |publisher=Sky Sports |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally assigned the number 17 shirt for his first season with Palace, however after Bolasie left for Everton, it was announced that Townsend had been reassigned the vacant number 10 shirt previously worn by Bolasie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/august/townsend-changes-shirt-number/ | title=Townsend Changes Shirt Number | publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. | date=19 August 2016 | accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role within the loan system==
Having had nine loan spells, Townsend's career path to regular first team football for Tottenham is often discussed in the context of a wider debate in English football about the best way to develop young talent, contrasting the loan route with Premier League players being developed in Under-21 leagues, or being brought to the Premier League level via transfers from lower league clubs. According to his father, the loan spells were the making of his son's career, while Tottenham's former Director of Football [[Damien Comolli]] who was dismissed in October 2008 believes Townsend succeeded in spite of the way Tottenham handled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |title=Premier League: Is the loan system being abused by clubs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34125476 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Harry Kane: Rise of Tottenham striker shows loaning out is increasingly the way to develop young players - Glenn Moore|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/glenn-moore-rise-of-kane-shows-loaning-out-is-increasingly-the-way-to-develop-young-players-10124360.html|newspaper=The Independent |location=London|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth levels===
Townsend represented England at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19 level]]. He played three times for the under-16s between 2006 and 2007, making his debut in a 1–1 draw away with [[Wales national under-16 football team|Wales]] on 20 October 2006 and his last appearance in a 2–0 away loss to [[Germany national under-16 football team|Germany]] in April 2007.&lt;ref name=TheFAprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/T/Andros-Townsend |title=Andros Townsend |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice on his under-17 debut, in a 6–1 win over [[Northern Ireland national under-17 football team|Northern Ireland]] in August 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/08/England17_vNIReport.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080312021738/http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/08/England17_vNIReport.htm |dead-url=yes |archivedate=12 March 2008 |title=Noel's boys hit six |author=Hunt, Ben |publisher=The Football Association |date=29 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make six appearances, the last in a 0–0 draw with [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal]] on 5 February 2008.&lt;ref name=TheFAprofile/&gt;

Townsend received his first call up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] in October 2012 for the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs|Euro 2013 play-off]] matches against [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/2012/under-21s-squad-v-serbia.aspx |title=Sterling selected for U21s |publisher=The Football Association |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first leg as a 65th-minute substitute for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2012/england-v-serbia |title=Craig gives England the edge |author=Bradbury, Jamie |publisher=The Football Association |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Townsend was charged by [[The Football Association]] over alleged breaches of its rules on betting. He subsequently voluntarily withdrew from England's squad for the upcoming European Under-21 Championship finals.&lt;ref name=BBC22658711&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22658711 |title=Andros Townsend: Spurs midfielder fined over betting |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted to charges under the FA's rules for breaching football betting regulations. After a personal hearing, he was fined £18,000 and suspended for four months backdated to 23 May 2013, with three months suspended until 1 July 2016.&lt;ref name=BBC22658711/&gt;

===Senior team===
Townsend's first call-up to the senior [[England national football team|England squad]] came in September 2013, for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group H|World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andros Townsend and Ross Barkley in England squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23853555|accessdate=27 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut in the starting eleven against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] in the World Cup qualifier on 11 October, aged 22 years 87 days. He was involved in England's first goal in a 4–1 win, scored the third with a "low swerving finish" from outside the penalty area after 78 minutes, two minutes before being substituted, and was named man of the match.&lt;ref name="England 4–1 Montenegro"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 4–1 Montenegro |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24393746 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a second cap in the World Cup qualifier against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], a playing almost all of the 2–0 home win, on 15 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=925|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further appearances came in the November friendlies, a 57th minute sub appearance in the 2–0 home defeat to [[Chile national football team|Chile]], and a full match in the 1–0 loss to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=926|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=927|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fifth cap came as a very late substitute in a March 2014 friendly, a 1–0 home win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=928|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second England goal came in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign in a 5–0 win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] on 9 October 2014, as he came on for the final third of the match.&lt;ref name="England 5–0 San Marino"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29454223 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next appearance marked his third England goal; on 31 March 2015 he scored the equaliser in the 79th minute against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], having come on as a 70th minute sub in a friendly match which ended 1–1.&lt;ref name="Italy 1–1 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Italy 1–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32028730 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20-yard strike was described as a "sweet right-foot drive into the bottom corner"; Townsend took to Twitter immediately after the match to respond to [[Paul Merson]] after he had said Townsend's club form did not justify him being anywhere near the England team.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; His eighth and ninth caps came in June 2015, first as a 66th minute sub in the 0–0 away draw to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] in a friendly on 7 June 2015, before playing for the first two-thirds of a 3–2 away win over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] on 14 June 2015 in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=943|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=944|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenth cap was in another Euro 2016 qualifier, this time as a 73rd minute sub in the 3–0 away win over [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=948|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Townsend was born in [[Leytonstone]], London.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt; He is of paternal [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] and maternal [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Greek Cypriot selected for the full England squad for world cup qualifiers|url=http://www.parikiaki.com/2013/08/first-greek-cypriot-selected-for-the-full-england-squad-for-world-cup-qualifiers|website=Parikiaki|date=August 2013|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in [[Chingford]], and is a lifelong Tottenham fan.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt; He attended [[Rush Croft Sports College]].&lt;ref name=THFCResProfile/&gt;

'''Dazet Wilfried Armel Zaha''' (born 10 November 1992) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivorian national team]].

Zaha advanced into the Crystal Palace first team from their academy, in 2010. In January 2013, he transferred to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for an initial fee of £10&amp;nbsp;million, [[Alex Ferguson]]'s last transfer before his retirement at the end of the season. Zaha remained on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Palace until the end of the season, helping them return to the Premier League. After an unsuccessful 2013–14 season with Manchester United (partly spent on loan at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]), Zaha returned to Palace in August 2014 on a season-long loan, before rejoining the club on a permanent basis in February 2015.

Born in the Ivory Coast, Zaha grew up in England from the age of four. He made his debut for the [[England national football team|England national team]] in 2012. He made two non-competitive appearances for England, the latter of which came in 2013, before switching his allegiances to the Ivory Coast ahead of the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]].

On 11 August 2013, Zaha made his debut for Manchester United in the [[2013 FA Community Shield]] against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref name=sb1314/&gt; He was included in the starting line-up and played 61 minutes before being replaced by [[Antonio Valencia]] as he won his first major honour in football.&lt;ref name=FACS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23565298 |title=Community Shield: Man Utd 2–0 Wigan |first=Tom |last=Rostance |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704152704/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23565298 |archivedate=4 July 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not play again until 29 October, starting in a 4–0 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the third round of the League Cup at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 4–0 Norwich City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24619369 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Premier League]] debut was on 7 December in a 1–0 home loss to [[Newcastle United]], as a substitute for [[Nani]] shortly after his team conceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |title=Manchester United 0–1 Newcastle United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25164173 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2014, Zaha completed a loan move to Cardiff City for the remainder of the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] season after being left out of favour by manager [[David Moyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transfer deadline day: Man Utd's Zaha joins Cardiff City on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25973209 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, following Moyes' sacking, Zaha said that he was never given a chance by the Scot. He contrasted his experience with that of [[Raheem Sterling]], another young attacker who was given a chance by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a difficult start.

Despite their poor start, Palace stayed up with a game in hand under new manager [[Roy Hodgson]], with the combination between Zaha and fellow winger [[Andros Townsend]] a key factor.&lt;ref name = "move up front"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Adrian |title=Move up front makes Zaha a striking force |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/668140 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Premier League |date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Premier League: Crystal Palace and Stoke – how one stayed up and one went down |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44017358 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Palace survival depends on Zaha staying fit, says Townsend |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-cry-townsend/palace-survival-depends-on-zaha-staying-fit-says-townsend-idUKKBN1GV0NJ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Reuters |date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named their Player of the Year for the third time in a row, a feat only done before by goalkeeper [[Julián Speroni]].&lt;ref name=poty18&gt;{{cite news |title=Zaha Named Palace’s 2017/18 Player of the Year |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2018/may/zaha-named-palaces-201718-player-of-the-year/ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
In Palace's first game of the new season on 11 August, Zaha scored the second goal of a 2–0 win at Fulham. It was his 23rd Premier League goal for the club, drawing level with [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] as their top scorer in the competition's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=Charlotte |title=Fulham 0–2 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha on target in Palace win |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/fulham-vs-c-palace/390759 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen days later, with a consolation goal in a 2–1 loss at Watford, he overtook Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fayiga |first1=Kunle |title=Wilfried Zaha can truly be fulfilled at Crystal Palace |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ng/news/wilfried-zaha-can-truly-be-fulfilled-at-crystal-palace/w0120dqxwdkr1an8d8qjcjghy |accessdate=30 August 2018 |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring a winning goal against [[Huddersfield Town]] in September 2018, Zaha publicly complained about what he considered to be a lack of appropriate protection by referees against fouls, saying that he would need a broken leg before any action would be taken. Data proved that in the last five years, he was the second most fouled player in the league after [[Eden Hazard]].&lt;ref name=bysouth&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bysouth |first1=Alex |title=Wilfried Zaha: Is the Crystal Palace winger a target?

==International career==
Zaha was eligible to represent both the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[England national football team|England]], the former because he has Ivorian parents and it was where he was born, and the latter because it is where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Stick with England, Pearce pleads with Palace wonderkid Zaha |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2109427/Stuart-Pearce-tells-Wilfried-Zaha-stick-England.html |location=London |newspaper=Daily Mail |first=Sami |last=Mokbel |date=2 March 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zaha was in good form for Crystal Palace under Hodgson ahead of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the manager said that he regretted not fielding the winger in a competitive game to tie him to England.&lt;ref name=brighton/&gt;

===Ivory Coast (2016–present)===
On 27 November 2016, the [[Ivorian Football Federation]] confirmed that Zaha had sent correspondence to [[FIFA]] to switch his international football allegiance from England to the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/10675387/wilfried-zaha-swaps-england-for-the-ivory-coast "Wilfried Zaha swaps England for the Ivory Coast"].

==Style of play==
Zaha can play as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] or as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].&lt;ref name="move up front" /&gt; In 2018, Adrian Clarke of the Premier League's website opined that he "offers more threat" as a frontman, going on to add that "his ultra-mobile combination with [Andros] Townsend generates more goals and points", citing "the speed, athleticism and unpredictable movement of the Zaha-Townsend axis is more difficult for opponents to contain".&lt;ref name="move up front" /&gt;

Zaha has been accused of [[diving (association football)|diving]], however Roy Hodgson, who managed him at club level for Crystal Palace and internationally [[England national football team manager|for England]], has stated: "Wilf Zaha does not dive for penalties. He gets knocked over sometimes – sometimes he gets knocked over or unbalanced without it being a penalty or a foul – because he runs at such speed and has such agility with the ball. But he certainly doesn’t dive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Hodgson warns ‘disgraceful’ Harry the Hornet over diving antics|agency=Press Association|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/24/roy-hodgson-warns-disgraceful-harry-the-hornet-over-diving-antics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson also said that Zaha's characterisation as a diver is because of a "campaign" and it causes fouls against him to be dismissed by referees.&lt;ref name=bysouth/&gt;

'''Mamadou Sakho''' (born 13 February 1990) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He is known for his tackling ability and his passing accuracy.

Sakho began his career at [[Paris FC]] before moving to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s youth system in 2002. In October 2007, on his league debut, he became the youngest player ever to captain a [[Ligue 1]] club. Sakho made over 200 appearances for the club, winning all four [[Football in France|domestic trophies]]. In 2013, he transferred to Liverpool for £18&amp;nbsp;million. He had a loan spell with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2017, and was subsequently bought by the team for £26&amp;nbsp;million on 1 September 2017.

Sakho is a full international, who has previously earned caps and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the nation at all youth levels. Since making his senior debut in 2010 against [[England national football team|England]], Sakho has over 25 caps and represented France at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Sakho was born in [[Paris]] to [[Senegal]]ese parents and was the fourth child of a family of seven children.&lt;ref name="biographie_sakho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mamadousakho.fr/fr/biographie-mamadou-sakho/ |title=Biographie 1/2 |accessdate=10 April 2010 |publisher=Mamadou Sakho Official Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312221958/http://www.mamadousakho.fr/fr/biographie-mamadou-sakho/ |archivedate=12 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the northern neighborhood of [[Goutte d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, Ervin. "[http://www.post-gazette.com/travel/20021027paris1027trp2.asp Little Africa in Paris is a continent within a city]." ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''. Sunday 27 October 2002. Retrieved 22 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Sakho started his football career at the age of six playing for the juniors of hometown club [[Paris FC]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 2002, he was lured away to professional club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. Sakho was originally a striker, but due to Paris Saint-Germain's youth team having fewer defenders than strikers, he was moved into a more defensive role.

Sakho struggled to adapt during his first year at the [[Camp des Loges]], the headquarters of the club's [[Youth system|youth academy]], often refusing to accept orders handed out by the trainers, such as when to go to bed. At one point, he was threatened with expulsion from the club due to his constant bad behavior. Following guidance from his parents and, particularly, under-13 Paris Saint-Germain coach Christian Mas, Sakho curbed his bad behavior and began to focus on his studies and football. When Sakho was 14, his father suddenly died. The resulting pain led to Sakho considering leaving football, but he later described that idea as "useless" and returned to the club after [[Grief|bereavement]]. Sakho quickly became one of the club's most sought after prospects winning numerous [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] awards during his time in the youth academy. In April 2005, he was a part of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]] team that won the 2004–05 Coupe Nationale. That same year, he was a part of the Paris Saint-Germain under-18 team that won the ''Championnat National des 18 ans'' league title, despite being three years younger than many of his teammates.&lt;ref name ="biographie_sakho" /&gt;

In total, Sakho spent nearly six years at the [[Camp des Loges]]. A day after his 17th birthday, manager [[Paul Le Guen]] called the youngster up for the club's [[UEFA Cup]] Round of 32 first leg match against [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] on 14 February 2007. Sakho started the match picking up a yellow card in the 20th minute. He played 85 minutes before being substituted out as Paris Saint-Germain won the match 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=2006/round=2366/match=85542/report=lu.html | title = AEK v. PSG Match Report |date= 14 February 2007 | accessdate =10 April 2010 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho played his second and final match of the season in the [[UEFA Cup]] Round of 16 first leg match against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], he played the full match in a 2–1 victory.

===Paris Saint-Germain===

====2007–10====
On 14 June 2007, Sakho signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://psgenforceleblog.football.fr/post/2007/06/14/740-mamadou-sakho-signe-pro?post_id=87615&amp;vote=yes&amp;mode=url |title= Mamadou Sakho signe pro |date= 14 June 2007 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=PSG En Force | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially promoted to the senior side for the [[Ligue 1 2007–08|2007–08 season]], despite being only 17 years old, and was assigned the first team number 3 shirt. Sakho made his first start that season for Paris Saint-Germain in the club's 3–0 win over [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] in the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] on 26 September 2007, starting in the centre back role alongside the experienced Colombian [[Mario Yepes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007/2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=T95&amp;num_ordre=2 | title = Lorient v.

Sakho's role as captain made him the youngest-ever captain of Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 17 years and 8 months and also the youngest player to ever captain a side in [[Ligue 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007/2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J11&amp;num_ordre=10 | title = FEUILLE DE MATCH 11ème Journée | date = 20 October 2007 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher = Ligue du Professionnel Football | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090524204528/http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007%2F2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;num_ordre=10&amp;code_jr_tr=J11 | archivedate = 24 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following match against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], he was named captain again and tasked with the role of containing fellow French starlet [[Hatem Ben Arfa]].

Sakho opened the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]] as the incumbent starter partnering either veterans [[Sammy Traoré]] or [[Zoumana Camara]] in defense. Midway through the season, Sakho was embroiled in controversy when he allegedly slapped a ''[[Le Parisien]]'' newspaper journalist at the [[Camp des Loges]], the club's training center. Before the incident, Sakho had allegedly confronted the journalist to question the accuracy of an article he had written referring to the controversy surrounding why Sakho went to a [[nightclub]] following Paris Saint-Germain's embarrassing loss to [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lepost.fr/article/2010/02/11/1936958_un-joueur-du-psg-frappe-un-journaliste_2.html | title = Un journaliste frappé par le joueur Mamadou Sakho: "Il m'a insulté et m'a mis une claque" |date= 11 February 2010 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=Le Post | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho reportedly insulted the journalist and then slapped him before walking away. The journalist, who preferred to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], filed a complaint the following day with both he and the newspaper describing Sakho's attitude as "unprofessional".

Sakho started the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 campaign]] partnering with Camara in defense. He was also installed as the team's captain in the [[UEFA Europa League]] by manager Kombouaré due to the unavailability of [[Claude Makelele]]. Midway through August, Sakho began appearing in the centre back position alongside veteran [[Sylvain Armand]].

On 10 May, Sakho was nominated for the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award. Two weeks later, he won the honour. Sakho was also named to the organization's Team of the Year alongside club teammate [[Nenê (footballer)|Nenê]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UNFP: Trophées UNFP du football Un petit coin de paradis...|url=http://www.unfp.org/a-la-une/actualite-detaillee/cat/19/article/un-petit-coin-de-paradis.html |work=[[National Union of Professional Footballers]] |date= 22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho began the [[2011–12 in French football|2011–12 season]] as the club's first-choice captain under Kombouaré. On 13 August 2011, in the club's second league match of the season, he suffered a [[hamstring]] injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mamadou Sakho blessé pour trois semaines|url=http://www.chronofoot.com/psg/psg-mamadou-sakho-blesse-pour-trois-semaines_art17181.html |work=Chronofoot |date= 15 August 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initially being ruled out for three weeks, Sakho missed two months and returned to the team in its 3–1 away win over [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]].

He was replaced by Italian manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]]. Under the helm of Ancelotti, Sakho retained the captaincy and appeared as a starter through March. However, after unconvincing performances in draws with Lyon, [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]], and Bordeaux, which resulted in the club losing its grip on first place, the captain was benched by Ancelotti and stripped of the captaincy. Ancelotti based Sakho's benching on the increased competition in the squad as the Italian preferred the central duo of [[Milan Biševac]] and [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carlo Ancelotti cherche encore son capitaine|url=http://www.chronofoot.com/psg/psg-carlo-ancelotti-cherche-encore-son-capitaine_art31086.html |work=Chronofoot |date= 9 May 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leparisien.fr"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bisevac-Alex, les deux font la paire|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/bisevac-alex-les-deux-font-la-paire-14-04-2012-1954337.php |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date= 14 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leparisien.fr"/&gt; Sakho was also questioned by club director [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]] for being "slightly overweight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le titre, le cas Mamadou Sakho, le mercato: Carlo Ancelotti dit tout!|url=http://www.footmercato.net/ligue1/le-titre-le-cas-mamadou-sakho-le-mercato-carlo-ancelotti-dit-tout_84219 |work=FootMercato |date= 30 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May, in PSG's final game of the season having already won the league, Sakho came on as an emergency goalkeeper for the final seven minutes against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] after substitute goalkeeper [[Ronan Le Crom]] had been sent off for fouling [[Julien Quercia]] to give away a penalty.

On 18 July 2016, it was announced that Sakho would wear the number 3 jersey for the [[2016–17 Liverpool F.C. season|2016–17 season]], switching from the number 17 he had worn since he joined Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/228132-mamadou-sakho-to-wear-no-3-shirt-for-2016-17|title=Mamadou Sakho to wear No.3 shirt for 2016-17|date=18 July 2016|publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]]|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States, Sakho was sent home by manager Jürgen Klopp for not respecting the rules that had been put in place for the squad. Klopp revealed that Sakho had been late for the team's flight as well as for a subsequent medical treatment session and a team meal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/28/jurgen-klopp-respect-mamadou-sakho-liverpool-us-tour|title=Jürgen Klopp sent Mamadou Sakho home for a 'lack of respect'|last=Dobson|first=Mark|date=28 July 2016|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Sakho was demoted from the senior squad and thus only played competitive football with the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserves]] in the [[Professional Development League]] that season.

====Loan to Crystal Palace====
On 31 January 2017, Sakho signed with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on loan until the end of the season. Sakho made his debut appearance in a 1–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 25 February, and was praised by manager [[Sam Allardyce]] for his role in Crystal Palace's victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com.au/news/allardyce-hails-van-aanholt-and-sakho-452654|title=ALLARDYCE HAILS VAN AANHOLT AND SAKHO|date=26 February 2017|work=FourFourTwo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Palace kept clean sheets in victories against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], Sakho was named a nominee for the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award for March&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/354749|title=EA SPORTS Player of the Month: Vote now!|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also awarded Crystal Palace's Player of the Month on March 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/march/sakho-scoops-mansion-player-of-the-month/|title=Crystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho has been named the Mansion Player of the Month for March|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho followed this up with well-received performances in Palace's 1–2 victory at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] over league leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and a 3–0 home win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/how-crystal-palace-falling-love-12876734|title=How Crystal Palace are falling in love with Mamadou Sakho|date=11 April 2017|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 31 August 2017, Sakho signed for Crystal Palace on a four-year contract, with a transfer fee of £24&amp;nbsp;million plus £2&amp;nbsp;million in add-ons being agreed with Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/september/sakho-makes-permanent-crystal-palace-move/|title=Sakho Makes Permanent Crystal Palace Move|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11706/11014400/crystal-palace-sign-mamadou-sakho-from-liverpool|title=Crystal Palace sign Mamadou Sakho from Liverpool|website=skysports.com|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth===
Sakho has been active with [[France national youth football team|France at youth level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rlfoot.fr/Joueurs/SAKHO_Mamadou.htm | title = La fiche de Mamadou SAKHO | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=RL Foot | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the age of 13, he began featuring with regional youth sides playing for [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] alongside fellow youth internationals [[Yacine Brahimi]], [[Tripy Makonda]], [[Maxime Partouche]], and [[Sébastien Corchia]]. Sakho made his debut for the [[France national under-16 football team|under-16 team]] on 21 March 2006 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Germany national youth football team|Germany]] in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/292421.shtml | title = La France bat l'Allemagne (3–1) |date= 21 March 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his only goal for the team in their 1–0 victory over [[England national under-16 football team|England]] in the [[Montaigu Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/297994.shtml | title = La France bat l'Angleterre (1–0) |date= 13 April 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; France later won the competition defeating [[Italy national under-16 football team|Italy]] 2–1 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/298516.shtml | title = La France remporte la finale (2–1) |date= 17 April 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[France national under-17 football team|under-17 team]], Sakho made his debut in the team's opening match against Cyprus in an international youth tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/318468.shtml | title = La France bat la Grèce (2–1) |date= 26 August 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the season, Sakho was named [[Captain (association football)|captain]] by coach François Blaquart who noticed the player's leadership skills. Under Sakho's captaincy, the team reached the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] and, later, the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] by virtue of their semi-final appearance in the UEFA-sanctioned tournament. At the U-17 World Cup, which was held in South Korea, Sakho captained the team to a quarter-final appearance where they lost to [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]] in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17worldcup/korea2007/teams/team=1888290/profile.html | title = France squad preview | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=FIFA.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due his increased playing time with his parent club, Sakho only made four appearances with the [[France national under-18 football team|under-18 team]]. He made his debut for the team on 18 December 2007 in a friendly match against [[Portugal national under-18 football team|Portugal]] and later featured in two friendly matches against [[Germany national under-18 football team|Germany]], one of which was played at the [[GAZi-Stadion auf der Waldau]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/414180.shtml | title = Courte défaite tricolore (1–0) |date=18 December 2007 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/428650.shtml | title = Succès allemand à Stuttgart (1–0) |date=11 March 2008 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with the [[France national under-19 football team|under-19 team]], Sakho's play with the team was limited not only due to his playing time with Paris Saint-Germain, but also due to his commitments with the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]]. Despite making only four appearances with the team, he was selected to play in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Paris Saint-Germain, however, refused his participation in order to preserve the player's fitness with the player having already played in the [[2009 Toulon Tournament]], which was held the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m19ans/selection/332273.shtml | title = Les joueurs retenus | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho made his France U21 debut on 19 August 2008 in a friendly match against [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/fiche_joueur/match.php?id_match=45 | title = France v. Slovakia Match Report |date=19 August 2008 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the 2009 Toulon Tournament and captained the team on two occasions serving in place of the lead captain for the tournament, [[Étienne Capoue]], who came off the bench. On 8 September 2009, Sakho scored his first under-21 goal in a [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification]] match against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]]. The match ended in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season=2011/round=2000006/match=2000191/index.html | title = Chesnakov pegs back France |date=8 September 2009 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=UEFA }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he was installed as the first-choice captain of the team following the selection of former captain [[Moussa Sissoko]] to the [[France national football team|senior team]].

===Senior===
[[File:Sakho.JPG|thumb|Sakho playing for France in 2013.]]
On 5 August 2010, Sakho was called up to the [[France national football team|France senior team]] for the first time by new manager [[Laurent Blanc]] for the team's [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on 11 August 2010. He didn't make his international debut in the match, but was subsequently called up by Blanc for national team matches in September and October 2010. On 17 November 2010, Sakho made his senior international debut against [[England national football team|England]] in a 2–1 win at [[Wembley Stadium]], appearing as a substitute at the start of the second half for [[Philippe Mexès]].

On 19 November 2013, in the second leg of their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|2014 World Cup qualifying play-off]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], Sakho scored his first and second international goals, giving ''Les Bleus'' a 3–2 aggregate win to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2510109/France-3-Ukraine-0-agg-3-2-match-report-Mamadou-Sakho-Karim-Benzema-Oleg-Gusev-goal-Les-Bleus-World-Cup.html|title= Sakho and Benzema ensure rampant Les Bleus complete mission impossible|date=19 November 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2014, Sakho was named in [[Didier Deschamps]]' squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy not in France squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27401306|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[FIFA World Cup]] debut in the team's opening match, keeping a clean sheet in partnership with [[Raphaël Varane]] in a 3–0 defeat of [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285092|title=France 3–0 Honduras|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match, ''Les Bleus'' were again on course for a shutout with Sakho in defence, leading 3–0 against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] when he was substituted with an injury in the 66th minute. The team eventually ran out 5–2 winners to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207|title=Switzerland 2–5 France|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=21 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho returned to the side for the next match, helping France to another clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285420|date=25 June 2014|title=Ecuador 0–0 France|accessdate=26 June 2014|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2018, he was named on the preliminary list for the [[French national football team|French squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/12025/11376691/alexandre-lacazette-and-anthony-martial-on-standby-for-france-world-cup-squad-and-dimitri-payet-out&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately did not make the final list.

==Style of play==
Sakho is renowned for his energy on the pitch, and had [[cult status]] at Liverpool for his interaction with the supporters.  In April 2016, Richard Innes of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' described him as "a defensive maverick; a man who plays by his own rules", who practises an "often highly ''alternative'' approach" to defending.&lt;ref name=innes/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sakho is married to Majda, with whom he has two daughters, Aida and Sienna, born in 2013 and 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mamadou Sakho : Sa fille Aïda s'incruste en direct à la télévision|trans-title=Mamadou Sakho: His daughter Aïda  is shown on live television|url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/mamadou-sakho-sa-fille-aida-s-incruste-en-direct-a-la-television_a171219/1|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Pure People|date=21 January 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Tidiane, born in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madja Sakho's Instangram|trans-title=Madja Sakho's Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfk8PQDjVQ0/|accessdate=24 Feb 2018|publisher=Instagram|date=24 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Liverpool Football Club's work in the community, Sakho helped teach the [[French language]] to local children when he played for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho teaches French to pupils|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32173950|accessdate=5 April 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho is a [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/28/world-cup-muslim-fasting_n_5538226.html|title=Will These Men Fast While Competing In The World Cup?|last=Service|first=Janet Tappin Coelho Religion News|date=2014-06-28|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wayne Robert Hennessey''' (born 24 January 1987) is a Welsh professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]].

Hennessey's first professional games saw him set a new League Two record for consecutive clean sheets while on loan at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. He played 166 times for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] over eight seasons, including three years at Premier League level. After several injury setbacks, he moved to join Crystal Palace in 2014.

A full international since 2007, Hennessey has earned more than 80 caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]].

==Early life and career==
Hennessey is a cousin of [[Terry Hennessey]], who earned 39 caps for Wales from 1962 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nardiello follows in father's footsteps |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-452221/Nardiello-follows-fathers-footsteps.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Bangor, Gwynedd]] and raised in [[Beaumaris]], [[Anglesey]], Hennessey speaks [[Welsh language|Welsh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wales players told to learn words of national anthem|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/22/gary-speed-wales-anthem|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at [[Ysgol David Hughes]] but switched to [[Connah's Quay High School]] as it was easier to travel to [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Where it all began for Wales' Euro 2016 goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/began-wales-euro-2016-goalkeeper-11425292|work=[[North Wales Daily Post]]|date=5 June 2016|first=Blake|last=Welton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennessey began as a trainee at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] but was released in 2003, whereupon he joined the youth academy at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. After progressing through the ranks, he signed professional forms in April 2005.

After remaining in Wolves' reserve and youth teams during the 2005–06 season, Hennessey was sent on trial with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in July 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=406314&amp;plid=50647&amp;clid=113&amp;cpid=11 |title=Stockport Robins admit McAllister interest |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=28 July 2006 |author=Alex Dunn |publisher=Sky Sports }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to a [[loan (sports)|loan]] move to gain [[first team]] experience but was recalled to Wolves after an injury to their first-choice goalkeeper [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]]. He did go back to Bristol City in August 2006, however, on a one-month loan deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=409245&amp;plid=50647&amp;clid=113&amp;cpid=11 |title=Robins to sign young keeper |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=11 August 2006 |author=Mark Buckingham |publisher=Sky Sports }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not make an appearance and returned to his parent club early due to an arm injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/5271818.stm Johnson eager to bring in keeper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Stockport County===
To gain first-team football, Hennessey joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in January 2007 on a one-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6252807.stm |title=Hatters sign goalkeeper Hennessey |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=11 January 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his senior debut against [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]], he kept a [[clean sheet]] and after keeping another five clean sheets in successive matches, his loan spell was extended by an extra month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6357051.stm |title=Stockport extend Hennessey loan |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=13 February 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to set a [[The Football League|Football League]] record of nine successive clean sheets and wins.&lt;ref name="FL record"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sport/story/0,,2026082,00.html |title=Leeds deeper in gloom as Nicholls says he wants away |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=4 March 2007 |author=Jason Tomas |newspaper=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockport broke the 119-year-old record,&lt;ref name="FL record"/&gt; when they beat [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] 3–0 on 3 March 2007.&lt;ref name="FL record"/&gt; After this accomplishment, he was named the League Two Player of the Month for February 2007.&lt;ref name="Hennessey's heroics secure award"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6417015.stm |title=Hennessey's heroics secure award |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=4 March 2007  |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His feat also means he now holds County's record for the longest period without conceding a goal, beating [[Harry Hardy]]'s 85-year-old record. His record now stands at 857 minutes, from the start of his competitive club debut, against Boston United on 13 January 2007, until [[Oliver Allen (footballer)|Oliver Allen]] of [[Barnet F.C|Barnet]] scored on 10 March 2007. He therefore did not concede in his first nine-and-a-half matches of competitive club football.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Hennessey was recalled by Wolves in April 2007 after another injury to first-choice [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportbox.tv/football/news/story.php?id=244508 |title=County lose Hennessey |accessdate=16 April 2007 |date=10 April 2007 |publisher=Sportbox.tv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929061750/http://www.sportbox.tv/football/news/story.php?id=244508 |archivedate=29 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and found himself on the substitutes bench for several games. When Murray broke his shoulder on the eve of Wolves' [[Football League Championship|Championship]] play-off semi-final first leg against local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], Hennessey stepped in to make his Wolves debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/6651217.stm |title=Murray out with broken shoulder |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Murray sidelined for the whole of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]] with yet another injury, Hennessey became firmly established at the club's number one, being an ever-present in the league and signing a new extended contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1218608,00.html |title=New Deals For Young Duo |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=18 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192732/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1218608,00.html |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season he was named in the [[PFA Team of the Year#Championship|2007–08 PFA Championship Team of the Year]] as well as being named Wolves' Player of the Season.&lt;ref name="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1303707,00.html |title=Hennessey Scoops Player of the Season Titles |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=2 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192816/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1303707,00.html |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine ranked him  22nd in their Top 50 Football League Players list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/footballleagueawards/archive/2008/03/02/fourfourtwo-50-best-football-league-players.aspx |title=FourFourTwo 50 Best Football League Players |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008–09 season saw a strong start for Hennessey and Wolves with eight victories out of the first nine league games. This fine run ended against promotion rivals [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] with a 0–3 loss begun by an own goal from Hennessey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7639348.stm |title=Wolves 0–3 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after manager [[Mick McCarthy]] dropped him to the bench, citing mental fatigue as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7654568.stm |title=Hennessey needs a rest – McCarthy |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reserve keeper [[Carl Ikeme]] deputised and impressed enough to leave Hennessey on the sidelines until an injury ruled him out for the majority of the season. Hennessey then regained and kept his place in goal for the remainder of the season which culminated with promotion to the [[Premier League]] as champions after a five-year absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8015237.stm |title=Wolves 1–0 Doncaster |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennessey began the club's 2009–10 Premier League campaign as first choice goalkeeper, making his 100th senior appearance for the club in a 2–2 draw at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wayne Hennessey is one appearance away from Wolverhampton Wanderers landmark|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/wolves-fc-news/2009/10/30/wayne-hennessey-is-one-appearance-away-from-wolverhampton-wanderers-landmark-97319-25051332/|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after conceding four goals in two successive games, he was replaced by the more experienced [[Marcus Hahnemann]] and remained on the bench for the rest of the season as the club finished 15th.

In July 2010, Hennessey extended his contract with Wolves to run until the summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8788850.stm |title=Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey signs new deal at Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season began with Hahnemann retaining the number one spot until his own loss of form saw Hennessey return to the starting line-up in November 2010. He then held on to the spot for the remainder of the campaign as the club narrowly avoided relegation on the final day.

During the 2011–12 season, Hennessey was part of the Wolves defence that went a club record of 30 consecutive league games without a clean sheet. They finally ended this with a goalless draw at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in April 2012, but by then the team was rooted to the bottom of the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17643422 |title=Sunderland 0–0 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the game halting this run, it brought bad news for Hennessey as he suffered a torn cruciate knee ligament during it that was due to keep him sidelined until Autumn 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17754937 |title=Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey out for six months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing several reserve games during his comeback he re-injured the knee during training in November 2012 which kept him out of action for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/wayne-hennessey-141112-486254.aspx |title=Crushing blow for keeper |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=14 November 2012 |access-date=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117002150/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/wayne-hennessey-141112-486254.aspx |archive-date=17 November 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20325266 |title=Wolves keeper Wayne Hennessey ruled out for the season|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his return to the Wolves goal during pre-season ahead of their 2013–14 campaign – with the club now in [[Football League One|League One]] having suffered two relegations since Hennessey's initial injury – but he was not selected to start the club's opening fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23340086|title=Wolves and Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey makes comeback|publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2013 it was agreed for the goalkeeper to spend a month on loan at [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] as he recovers from his long-term injury problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gloveman-to-glovers-120813-988291.aspx|title=Gloveman to Glovers?|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=12 August 2013|access-date=12 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814142511/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gloveman-to-glovers-120813-988291.aspx|archive-date=14 August 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before this deal was officially concluded Hennessey suffered a hamstring problem while on international duty with the Welsh national team and so the proposed loan was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23715305|title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper's injury halts Yeovil loan|publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, on 21 August 2013, after an injury to Yeovil's replacement goalkeeper [[Sam Johnstone]] Hennessey officially joined Yeovil Town on an initial one-month loan which was eventually extended until 17 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23779668 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper cleared for Yeovil Town loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24674195 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Yeovil Town keep Wolves goalkeeper on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Yeovil debut in a 0–3 loss to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 24 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23744657 |title=Yeovil 0–3 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his penultimate home match Hennessey received the man of the match award after the Glovers achieved their first ever home win at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] by defeating [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24590303 |title=Yeovil 3–1 Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 October 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his loan spell at Yeovil ended, Hennessey returned to Wolves but did not displace [[Carl Ikeme]] in goal. When Ikeme suffered an injury in January 2014, Hennessey declined to play in the following fixture against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], launching speculation that he wanted a move away from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12040/9100583/league-one-wolves-goalkeeper-wayne-hennessey-declines-to-play-against-gillingham |title=League One: Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey declines to play against Gillingham |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he subsequently apologised for his refusal to play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25645844|title=Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey apologises for no-show|publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did not play again for Wolves and negotiations were later entered into with [[Premier League]] team [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Drayton |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2533160/Crystal-Palace-set-sign-goalkeeper-Wayne-Hennessey-Wolves.html |title=Palace set to capture Wolves outcast Hennessey as Pulis targets first signing |work=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 31 January 2014, Hennessey joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a three-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee, with media speculation suggesting it to be an initial £1.6 million, with add-on clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hennessey Signs For Palace |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/january/hennessey-signs-for-palace/ |work=Crystal Palace FC |date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25980091|title=Wolves' Wayne Hennessey joins Palace|publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennessey made his debut for the Eagles in the team's final match of the [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League season]], a 2–2 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 11 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/11205470.Eagles_held_at_Fulham_despite_Gayle_brace/|title=Fulham 2–2 Crystal Palace|date=12 May 2015|work=The Bolton News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennessey's first appearance of the [[2014–15 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2014–15 season]] came a 3–0 win at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28847260|title=Walsall 0–3 Crystal Palace|work=BBC|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, he made his first [[2014–15 Premier League|Premier League]] appearance of the season as a substitute for injured first choice goalkeeper [[Julián Speroni]] in a 2–2 draw at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29671751|title=West Brom 2–2 Crystal Palace|date=25 October 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season starting in Palace's final two league fixtures, wins against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], keeping his first Premier League clean sheet for the club in the latter match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32670817|title=Liverpool 1–3 Crystal Palace|date=16 May 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32770846 |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Swansea|date=24 May 2015|work=BBC |accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starting in Crystal Palace's [[2015–16 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] second and third round matches, Hennessey was selected to start the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]] fixture against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in place of [[Alex McCarthy]]. He kept a clean sheet as Palace won 1–0 at [[Vicarage Road]] and has retained his place as the team's first choice goalkeeper, making five consecutive league appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/wayne-hennessey|title=13 Wayne Hennessey|accessdate=3 November 2015|work=Premier League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Hennessey was capped for Wales at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level. He once scored for the under-19 side with a 40-yard free kick against [[Turkey national under-19 football team|Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/stockport_county/s/233/233326_hennessey_puts_county_strikers_in_shade.html |title=Hennessey puts County strikers in shade |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=16 January 2007 |author=Stuart Brennan |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his full international debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in a 2–2 [[exhibition game|friendly]] draw against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] on 26 May 2007 and has since established himself as his country's first-choice goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wayne Hennessey out to establish himself as Wales’ No 1 goalkeeper|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2009/10/09/wayne-hennessey-out-to-establish-himself-as-wales-no-1-goalkeeper-91466-24886688/|newspaper=South Wales Echo|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennessey made his 50th appearance for Wales on 3 September 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gwilym|first1=Andrew|title=Cyprus vs Wales match report: Gareth Bale's bullet header has Welsh on brink of Euro 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/cyprus-vs-wales-match-report-gareth-bales-bullet-header-has-welsh-on-brink-of-euro-2016-10485586.html|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=The Independent|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennessey played in all ten of Wales' qualifying matches for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], conceding just four times, as they reached their first major international tournament since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named in Wales' 23-man squad for the tournament as first choice goalkeeper but was forced to miss the opening game of the tournament, a 2–1 victory over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]], after suffering a [[back spasm]] prior to the match, being replaced by [[Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)|Danny Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36507888 |title=Euro 2016: Hennessey ruled out of Wales opener with back spasm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2016 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, an investigation was launched by the [[The Football Association|FA]] after Hennessey was pictured making what appeared to be a [[Nazi salute]] in a group photo posted on [[Instagram]] by teammate [[Max Meyer (footballer)|Max Meyer]]. Hennessey denied making the salute, claiming that "any kind of resemblance to that kind of gesture is absolutely coincidental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wayne Hennessey: Football Association looking into alleged Nazi salute |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46796546 |accessdate=11 January 2019 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loan to Brentford ====
Schlupp joined [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on a one-month [[loan (sports)|loan]] on 14 March 2011, declining a call up to the [[Germany national youth football team|Germany Under-19]] squad in order to complete the move.&lt;ref name="bring-in"/&gt; He made his senior debut in a 1–0 defeat to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] coming on as a substitute on 77 minutes on 15 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9422282.stm|title=Brentford 0 – 1 Huddersfield|work=BBC Sport|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his first full senior appearance in his career he scored two goals winning the match against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 2–1 on 25 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9429110.stm|title=Brentford 2 – 1 Carlisle|work=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlupp earned a start in Brentford's next match and proved himself once more by scoring a header from a [[Lewis Grabban]] cross against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9436379.stm|title=Sheff Wed 1 – 3 Brentford|work=BBC Sport|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2011–12 season ====
[[File:Schlupp 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Schlupp playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2011]]
On returning to Leicester, Schlupp travelled with the squad on their tour to Sweden often playing in friendlies as a left-back.

Schlupp ended his first season in the Leicester first team, scoring six times in 26 games in all competitions.

==== 2012–13 season ====
Schlupp spent a week in January 2013 training with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11712/8406224/Manchester-United-have-taken-Leicester-City-s-Jefferey-Schlupp-on-trial | title=Manchester United have taken Leicester City's Jefferey Schlupp on trial | work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trial was extended into a second and third week into the beginning of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/21368222|title=Jeffrey Schlupp: Nigel Pearson coy about Man Utd 'move'|work=BBC Sport|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Manchester United he played two under-21 games, a game against Liverpool and then a game against West Ham at Upton Park.

Upon Schlupp's return to Leicester he found his way into the Leicester team both at left back and in attack, scoring three goals towards the latter part of the [[2012–13 Football League Championship|2012–13]] season. Schlupp scored key goals in back to back home games against Birmingham City and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

==== 2013–14 season ====
Schlupp opened his goalscoring account for the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14]] season, rounding off a 3–1 away win to against Millwall on New Year's Day 2014 with smart finish through the goalkeeper's legs on his weaker foot. Following regular left-back [[Paul Konchesky]] receiving a three-match suspension for a red card against East Midlands rivals [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], Schlupp found greater opportunities at the back of the Leicester side, putting in highly rated performances against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

==== 2014–15 season ====
On 16 August 2014, Schlupp made his [[Premier League]] debut as a second-half substitute against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the opening weekend of the season. On 4 October, Schlupp scored his first Premier League goal, in the 2–2 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Schlupp scored his second goal of the season on 29 November, in the 2–3 defeat against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] before adding his third in the 2–2 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/29/england/premier-league/queens-park-rangers-fc/leicester-city-fc/1703741/|title=QUEENS PARK RANGERS VS.

|work=Soccerway|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2015, Schlupp's fine first season in the Premier League was met with reward as he was named Leicester City's Young Player of the Year, as voted by the fans, as well as winning the Players' Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esteban Cambiasso Named Leicester City Player of the Year|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/esteban-cambiasso-named-leicester-city-player-of-the-year-2461984.aspx|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Leicester City|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2015–16 season ====

Schlupp started as the left back during Leicester's flying start to the season, although he later moved into a midfield role as the season progressed. Schlupp scored his first goal of the season in the 2–1 away victory against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34366647|title=Norwich City 1 – Leicester City 2|work=BBC Sport|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ruled out for six weeks in December with a hamstring injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11712/10102756/leicester-have-been-hit-by-jeff-schlupps-hamstring-injury|title=Leicester hit by Jeff Schlupp's hamstring injury|work=Sky Sports|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from the injury Schlupp had a strong impact on Leicester City's season, and contributed hugely to Leicester's unlikely title triumph.

'''Christian Benteke Liolo''' (born 3 December 1990) is a Belgian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for English club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

He began his career at [[Standard Liège]], playing a part in their [[2008–09 Belgian First Division]] triumph. Following a season at [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]] he was signed for £7 million by Aston Villa. He scored 49 goals in 100 matches for Villa across all competitions, including 19 Premier League goals in his debut season and helping them to the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], before transferring to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2015 for £32.5 million. He spent a single season at Liverpool, scoring a total of ten goals, before being transferred to Crystal Palace at the start of the 2016–17 season.

Benteke has earned over 30 caps for Belgium since making his debut in 2010. He missed the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] through injury, but was part of their team that reached the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
Benteke was born in [[Kinshasa]] in 1990. He and his family fled during the [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] regime and in 1993 emigrated to [[Liège]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Wallace|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/christian-benteke-street-football-took-brilliant-belgians-to-top-8298505.html|title=Christian Benteke: Street football took brilliant Belgians to top|location=London|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Standard Liège and Genk===
Benteke played youth football for JS Pierreuse and later [[Standard Liège]] before moving to [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]. He rejoined Standard in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/WNATb23a8af74ba369c45b1b97f597636c02/ |title=Christian Benteke volgt Bolat |publisher=Article.wn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored three goals in 12 matches as the Walloon club won the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|2008–09]] [[List of Belgian football champions|Belgian championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/division1/standard/standard-champion-51b7afd3e4b0de6db987c419|title=Standard champion !|date=24 May 2009|language=French|work=DH.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 August 2009, he joined [[KV Kortrijk]] on loan for a season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Footgoal.Net |url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=42996 |title=Officiel : Benteke à Courtrai, Van Hout au Standard |publisher=Footgoal.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810074449/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=42996 |archivedate=10 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he scored 14 goals in the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League|Belgian Pro League]], including five goals in the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League#Championship Playoff|championship play-offs]], as the club achieved its best ever finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/analysis-liverpool-fc-match-winner-9885143|title=Analysis: Liverpool FC match winner Benteke reaches 50 Premier League goals|date=19 August 2015|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent the following season on loan at [[KV Mechelen]] as part of the transfer of [[Aloys Nong]], who moved from Mechelen to Standard Liège. Benteke's spell at Mechelen was less successful, with seven goals from 25 appearances. He returned to Genk from Standard in August 2011 for an undisclosed fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/1.1098745|title=Benteke verhuist van Standard naar Genk |date=29 August 2011|language=Dutch|work=Sporza}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to score 16 goals and register nine assists in 20 starts during the [[2011–12 Belgian Pro League|2011–12 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Players/68312/ |title=Christian Benteke &amp;#124; Age 21 |publisher=WhoScored.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beginning the [[2012–13 Belgian Pro League|2012–13]] season with three goals from five league matches, Benteke was subject of an offer of €6m from [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/29/aston-villa-genk-christian-benteke|title=Aston Villa ready to abandon bid for Genk's Christian Benteke|date=30 August 2012|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===

====2012–13 season====
On 31 August 2012, Benteke joined [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on a four-year deal for a fee believed to be around £7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stuart James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/01/aston-villa-sign-christian-benteke |title=Aston Villa sign £7m Christian Benteke but are forced to defend transfers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 September 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke stated it was a dream come true in getting a move to the Premier League and thanked the players and manager at [[K.R.C. Genk]] for his move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2196578/Christian-Benteke-signs-Aston-Villa.html |title=Christian Benteke signs for Aston Villa |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=31 August 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2012, Benteke scored on his debut for Aston Villa in a 2–0 win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], after coming on as a substitute for Austrian forward [[Andreas Weimann]]. The goal came when Swansea defender [[Ashley Williams (footballer)|Ashley Williams]] headed the ball into Benteke's path, which he then lifted over the keeper and tapped in on the volley. Villa manager [[Paul Lambert]] praised Benteke's performance on his debut calling him "unplayable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19528067 |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored Villa's only goal in a 1–1 home draw with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20014232 |title=Aston Villa 1–1 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added a further two goals to his tally during a 3–2 victory over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20053684 |title=Swindon 2–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the winner in a 1–0 Premier League victory for Villa against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at [[Villa Park]] on 27 November to continue his impressive start in [[Football in England|English football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20405324 |title=Aston Villa 1–0 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate= 16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benteke then scored Villa's fourth goal in a 4–1 League Cup win over Norwich City at [[Carrow Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20590506 |title=Norwich 1–4 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke further added to his impressive start in Premier League football by scoring two goals in Villa's 3–1 win against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] on 15 December. In addition to the two goals, he also assisted Villa's second goal with a back-heel to Andreas Weimann. [[Paul Lambert]] said afterwards that 'Benteke has been unbelievable', after already stating midweek (post–[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]]) that 'you run out of things to say about the guy, how well he's performing and how young he is'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20650106 |title=Liverpool 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around Christmas time, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager [[André Villas-Boas]] was reportedly interested in signing Benteke, referring to him as the season's "surprise package".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/25/tottenham-andre-villas-boas-christian-benteke|title=Tottenham's André Villas-Boas eyes summer move for Christian Benteke|last=Hytner|first=David|date=2012-12-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After not scoring for three games, Benteke scored Villa's first [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in almost a year in a 2–2 draw away to Swansea City in Villa's first game of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20840916 |title=Swansea 2–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded his 10th goal of the season with a 28-yard strike against [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C|West Bromwich Albion]] in a 2–2 draw at [[The Hawthorns]]. The goal was nominated for January's goal of the month competition on [[Match of the Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20996732 |title=West Brom 2–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then netted Villa's first goal in their 2–1 [[2012-13 Football League Cup#Semi-finals|League Cup semi-final]] victory over [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. However, the victory was not enough as Bradford won 4–3 on aggregate to progress to the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21022502 |title=Aston Villa 2–1 Bradford (3–4) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[England national football team|England]] striker [[Michael Owen]] called him one of the signings of the season and posted a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]] the day after the semi-final saying: 'I'm seriously impressed with Benteke. What a player.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/themichaelowen/statuses/293820156210188288 |title=Tweet |publisher=Twitter |date=23 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke continued his rich scoring form with a goal against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and a brace against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], in a game that Villa had led 3–1 at one point but eventually finished 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21137565 |title=Aston Villa 1–2 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209061 |title=Everton 3–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He racked up his 15th goal in all competitions, as well as tallying six goals in five games, when he scored a penalty in a 2–1 victory against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 10 February 2013. This was Villa's first league victory in eight games, since Benteke inspired the win against Liverpool back in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311649 |title=Aston Villa 2–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benteke scored a deflected goal in a 2–1 victory at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], scoring the club's 1,000th goal in the [[Premier League]] in the process. The following week he went on to score a goal that sealed a 3–2 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21639183 |title=Reading 1–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21724358 |title=Aston Villa 3–2 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored the third goal to seal a 3–1 win against relegation rivals [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Britannia Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21979453 |title=Stoke 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] after his excellent debut season, eventually finishing as runner-up to eventual double award winner [[Gareth Bale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22216746 |title=Carrick, Bale, Suarez, Van Persie, Hazard &amp; Mata on PFA shortlist |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April, Benteke scored his first [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] for Aston Villa in a 6–1 thrashing of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. These goals also saw him exceed [[Dwight Yorke]]'s record for most Premier League goals in a season (18) by an Aston Villa player and pass the 20 goal mark in all competitions, becoming the first player to do so for Villa since [[Juan Pablo Ángel]] in the [[2003-04 Aston Villa F.C. season|2003–04 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22244165 |title=Aston Villa 6–1 Sunderland |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May, Benteke scored Villa's only goal in a 1–2 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] but in the second half he was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for a high boot on [[John Terry]], meaning he would miss the last game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22409606|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Chelsea|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====

Benteke's 23 goals in 2012–13 led to speculation about his future, and in early July he submitted a transfer request.

On 17 August 2013, Benteke scored twice, once from a penalty and one headed goal via a rebound from a missed penalty, in Aston Villa's 3–1 away-win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644714 |title=Arsenal 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2014, Benteke suffered a rupture of his [[achilles tendon]] while training and was ruled out for at least six months, missing the remainder of the season and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/03/christian-benteke-suffers-achilles-injury-aston-villa-belgium-world-cup|title=Christian Benteke ruled out of World Cup after rupturing achilles|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2014|publisher=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
On 2 November 2014, Benteke was given a straight red card by referee [[Neil Swarbrick]] for pushing the face of [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Ryan Mason]] after Mason had stuck his face in Benteke's chest. Villa had been winning at the time, but went on to lose 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whalley|first1=Mike|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29775975|accessdate=2 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to both clubs being fined £20,000 by [[The FA]] for failing to keep their players under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aston Villa and Tottenham fined £20,000 each by FA|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29921851|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 22 July 2015, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] completed the signing of Benteke on a "long-term contract"&lt;!--This is Liverpool's own description of it, so it needs quotation marks, just as it is reported in the BBC article used as a source--&gt; after meeting his release clause of £32.5 million, at the time making him their second [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics#Record transfer fees paid|most expensive transfer]] ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool sign £32.5m Aston Villa striker|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33627800|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=22 July 2015|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 2 August in a pre-season friendly at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], putting Liverpool into the lead with a volley as they went on to win 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool striker scores in Swindon friendly|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33754238|accessdate=3 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After missing several games through injury, Benteke returned to score in consecutive games as a substitute on 25 and 31 October: a 1–1 draw against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Match Report|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34564965|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 October 2015|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1–3 away win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34623902|last=McNulty|first=Phil|title=Chelsea 1–3 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, he replaced compatriot [[Divock Origi]] in the first half of a home fixture against league leaders [[Leicester City]], and scored the only goal in a victory that curtailed the visitors' nine-game unbeaten run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jurejko|first1=Jonathan|title=Liverpool 1–0 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35140035|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2016, Benteke was named as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for Liverpool's [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] third round tie with [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] at [[St James Park (Exeter)|St James Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/exeter-vs-liverpool-team-news-christian-benteke-captains-jurgen-klopps-youthful-liverpool-line-up-a6803166.html|title=Exeter vs Liverpool team news: Christian Benteke the captain as Jurgen Klopp makes 11 changes|date=9 January 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2016, Benteke scored his tenth goal of his only season at Liverpool with a 92nd-minute equaliser in the team's final home game of 2015–16, a 1–1 draw with Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/live-coverage-of-liverpool-v-chelsea-sunderland-v-everton-norwich-v-watford/news-story/ead855105fd49409ddea00b7dd52a3f9|title=Liverpool v Chelsea: Christian Benteke cancels out Eden Hazard goal at Anfield in Premier League|date=12 May 2016|publisher=Fox Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke was often found on the bench because he wasn't fitting into [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s style of play. Because of this, he ended his stint at Liverpool after making 42 appearances and scoring 10 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/232467-christian-benteke-completes-move-to-palace|title=Christian Benteke completes move to Palace|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Christian_Benteke.JPG|thumb|upright|Benteke with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 2013]]

Benteke was a member of the [[Belgium national under-17 football team|Belgium U17]] team at the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup squads|2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] in South Korea where he played three games and scored once.&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|274008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2010, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] in a friendly match against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in Brussels after his former coach at [[KV Kortrijk|Kortrijk]], [[Georges Leekens]], became national coach. On 15 August 2012, he scored his first goal in a 4–2 win against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Since then, he has become a regular starter for Belgium under [[Marc Wilmots]]. On 29 May 2013, he scored twice in a 4–2 friendly victory against the [[USMNT|United States]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slane|first1=Mike|title=United States 2–4 Belgium: Sloppy defensive play leads to friendly defeat|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/united-states-vs-belgium/1460935/report|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored two goals in seven appearances during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/teams/player=1902165/index.html|title=Christian Benteke|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ruled out of the tournament finals with a ruptured Achilles tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=2083755.html|title=Belgium's Benteke ruled out of World Cup|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benteke returned to Belgium's squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, scoring his first international goal for two years in a 5–0 defeat of [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] on 28 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/live/day=5/session=2/match=2013931/index.html|title=Belgium 5–0 Cyprus|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2016|the final tournament]] in France, and made his tournament debut in the second group game on 18 June, replacing [[Romelu Lukaku]] for the last seven minutes of a 3–0 win over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saffer|first1=Paul|title=Belgium find best form to beat Ireland|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000448/match=2017955/postmatch/report/|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played three more minutes in place of the same player four days later in a victory over [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ladyman|first1=Ian|title=Sweden 0–1 Belgium: Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Co bow out of Euro 2016 as Radja Nainggolan scores screamer in Nice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3655065/Sweden-0-1-Belgium-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-bow-Euro-2016-Radja-Nainggolan-scores-screamer-Nice.html|accessdate=4 July 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but took no further part as the Belgians reached the quarter-finals and lost to [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. On 10 October 2016, Benteke set a record for the fastest goal in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] match—either qualifying or the finals—when he scored after 8.1 seconds against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group H|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match]], breaking the 23-year-old record previously held by [[Davide Gualtieri]].

===Hamilton Academical===
Born in [[Glasgow]] and raised in the city's [[Barrowfield]] district, McArthur attended [[Whitehill Secondary School]] and supported [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in his youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12380478.Family_feeling_is_the_secret_of_success_so_far_for_Hamilton/ |title=Family feeling is the secret of success so far for Hamilton |publisher=The Herald |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Rangers South BC (alongside future international colleagues [[Robert Snodgrass]] and [[Graham Dorrans]]),&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/robert-snodgrass-grassroots-football-glasgow-7592004 |title=Robert Snodgrass: Grassroots football in Glasgow was tough... but it is brilliant |work=Daily Record|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone pro youth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/scotland/james-mcarthur-i-ll-always-remember-don-hutchison-s-goal-1-4469383 |title=James McArthur: 'I'll always remember Don Hutchison's goal'|publisher=The Scotsman |date=8 June 2017|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers SABC and [[Clyde F.C.

He made his professional debut in January 2005 against [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]]. He established himself in the Hamilton team the following season and scored his first goal in April 2006 against St Johnstone.

Such was his progress that he was given the captaincy for Hamilton against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in February 2008 for a [[Scottish Cup]] tie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=477&amp;Itemid=38|title=Aberdeen 1 Accies 0|publisher=Hamilton Academical F.C|date=2 February 2008|access-date=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207100148/http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=477&amp;Itemid=38|archive-date=7 February 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated for the First Division Player of the Year for the [[2007–08 Scottish First Division|2007–08]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/7335161.stm|title= Dorrans and McDonald on shortlist|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 after helping his side to the [[Scottish First Division]], McArthur was awarded with a new three-year contract. By the time he departed from [[New Douglas Park]] aged 22, he had played in nearly 200 matches for ''Accies''.

===Wigan Athletic===
In the 2009–10 season, several English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] and [[Premier League]] clubs, including [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], showed an interest in McArthur. On 5 April 2010, McArthur went on a three-day visit to [[Premier League]] club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] with a view to a permanent move in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hamilton_academical/8598986.stm|title= Hamilton Accies' James McArthur to visit Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a four-year contract at the [[DW Stadium]] on 23 July for a fee of around £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hamilton_academical/8839771.stm|title= James McArthur completes move from Hamilton to Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2100292,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725010259/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2100292,00.html |archive-date=25 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move reunited him with former Hamilton teammate [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]], who had made the same move at the beginning of the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]] season. On 31 January 2012, McArthur scored his first goal for Wigan in a 3–1 loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and followed it up two games later with a winning goal over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]] in a game which finished 2–1 to Wigan. McArthur extended his contract with Wigan in May 2012, with the new deal due to run until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18118717 |title=Wigan extend contract of Scotland midfielder James McArthur |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2013 McArthur won the [[FA Cup]], playing the whole game in a 1–0 upset win against [[Manchester City]].&lt;ref name=facup13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22409634 |title=Man City 0 - 1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only three days later, Wigan were relegated from the Premier League following a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22430454|title=Arsenal 4 - 1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wigan rejected a first offer of £5 million from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for McArthur in August 2014, but then accepted a proposed valuation of nearly £7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28957513 |title=James McArthur: Leicester set to sign Wigan Athletic midfielder |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A payment schedule was not agreed and the proposed transfer collapsed, with Leicester signing [[Esteban Cambiasso]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28983784 |title=James McArthur: Leicester move for Wigan midfielder collapses |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the summer 2014 transfer window, Wigan accepted a £7 million offer from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] for McArthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29013298 |title=Transfer deadline day: Crystal Palace to sign Wigan's McArthur |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===

He came on as a 66th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Veliče Šumulikoski]] in a 3–1 home defeat against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7978909.stm | title = Ipswich 1–3 Doncaster | publisher= [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 11 April 2009| date = 11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so he became Ipswich's youngest ever player, beating the previous record being held by [[Jason Dozzell]] by 46 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=News&amp;itemid=IPED25%20Oct%202007%2007%3A06%3A10%3A037|title=Teenage star set to shine|date=24 October 2007|work=[[Evening Star (Ipswich)|Evening Star]]|accessdate=9 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317011632/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline|archivedate=17 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10====
[[File:Connor Wickham - It 6.jpg|thumb|Wickham with Ipswich Town in 2009]]
Wickham scored his first two senior goals in only his fourth appearance, when he scored in Ipswich's [[2009–10 Football League Cup#First round|2009–10 League Cup]] tie against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. He also scored in the [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], which saw Ipswich prevail 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shrewsbury 3–3 Ipswich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8188438.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2009

This came two days after he signed his first professional contract at Ipswich, a two-year deal following his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name="Connor Signs Two Year Deal"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10272~2014145,00.html | title = Connor Signs Two Year Deal | publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 4 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100602214223/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10272~2014145%2C00.html | archivedate = 2 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Wickham was named the Football League [[Football League Young Player of the Month|young player of the month]]. He won the award after scoring three goals in four matches during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=16469 | title = Wickham Young Player of the Month |publisher = TWTD |date= 17 May 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] made offers to buy Wickham, but these were rejected by Ipswich Town.&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Henderson | first = Mel | title = Ipswich wonderkid Connor Wickham passes Euro test on his way to the top | newspaper = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 1 June 2010 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1282957/Ipswich-wonderkid-Connor-Wickham-passes-Euro-test-way-top.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | accessdate = 1 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11====
Wickham extended his contract with Ipswich to 2013 in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Connor Wickham signs fresh Ipswich Town deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/9370218.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an offer clause in it which states that if any bid equals or beats the one written in the contract, Ipswich would have to allow him to speak to the bidding club. It was reported that the figure was around the £15 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Wickham Contract Has Offer Clause|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=17929&amp;title=new_wickham_contract_has_offer_clause |publisher=TWTD|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2011, Wickham scored Ipswich's his first goal of the season in a 3–2 win over Doncaster Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9365340.stm|title=Ipswich 3-2 Doncaster|date=29 January 2018|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two games later, Wickham scored in a 3–0 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at [[Portman Road]]. A clearance of a set piece saw Wickham pass two opponents before wrong-footing [[Rob Kozluk]] and goalkeeper [[Steve Simonsen]] to tap the ball into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9389147.stm|title=Ipswich 3-0 Sheff Utd|date=14 February 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Ipswich player, [[Kevin Beattie]] witnessed the goal, and described it as one of the greatest goals ever scored at Portman Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=17866&amp;title=town_topic:_the_greatest_town_goals|title=Town Topic: The Greatest Town Goals - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later Wickham recorded his first professional [[hat-trick]] in a 6–0 win at Doncaster Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11707_6771920,00.html | title = Jewell hopes to keep Wickham| publisher = Sky Sports | date = 22 February 2011 | accessdate = 22 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham's superb scoring form continued when he scored late in the match against Reading on 8 March. With Ipswich already 3–0 down, his goal counted for little, although it was once again a superb finish, as he volleyed a ball that was coming over his shoulder into the top corner of the goal from a tight angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9415246.stm|title=Ipswich 1-3 Reading|date=8 March 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2011, Wickham was named Championship player of the month for February after scoring four goals in the month, including his first professional hat-trick at Doncaster.&lt;ref name="twtd.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18009&amp;title=wickham_named_championship_player_of_the_month|title=Wickham Named Championship Player of the Month - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later he was named the Football League Young Player of the Year as well as the Championship Apprentice of the Year at the [[Football League Awards|2011 Football League Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.football-league.co.uk/flawards/news/20110320/connor-wickham-wins-young-player-of-the-year_2293338_2319366 | title = Connor Wickham wins Young Player of the Year| publisher = Football League | date = 20 March 2011 | accessdate = 20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2011, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager, [[Harry Redknapp]] admitted that his side had not made a bid for Wickham. This was despite several reports to the contrary suggesting a bid in the region of £10m had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11890_6847653,00.html|title=Harry denies bids|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Wickham scored the second of Ipswich's two goals against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the Championship, as they won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9439038.stm|title=Burnley 1-2 Ipswich|date=2 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 8 April 2011, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13012409|title=Connor Wickham extends Ipswich Town contract|date=8 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham admitted he was delighted to have signed the contract, and said he just wanted to concentrate on achieving his goals with Ipswich, rather than focusing on speculation about his future. He said:

{{Cquote|I'm obviously delighted to have signed a new contract and feel that I'm at the right club to progress as a player. After having a look over the last two years I approached this season wanting to make a real impact. It didn't start well with me getting injured but I feel I have moved forward as a player since I got back in the side. I'm playing games every week, I'm enjoying my football and the club is moving in the right direction and that's all I want.|||Connor Wickham|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18220&amp;title=wickham_delighted_to_extend_contract|title=Wickham Delighted to Extend Contract - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He scored his next league goal on 7 May away to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], making the score 3–2 in Leicester's favour.

===Sunderland===
On 29 June 2011, Wickham signed a four-year deal with [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a fee of £8 million. The fee has the potential to rise to £12 million over the course of the contract.&lt;ref name="Black Cats snap up Wickham"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.safc.com/news/20110629/black-cats-snap-up-wickham_2256213_2383586 | title = Black Cats snap up Wickham | date=29 June 2011 | publisher = Sunderland A.F.C. | accessdate = 29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite having recently signed a new contract with Ipswich, Wickham had been widely tipped to move to a Premier League club following a highly successful 2010–11 season. Although Ipswich manager [[Paul Jewell]] had said there was no pressure to sell the youngster, Sunderland's eventual offer proved too lucrative.&lt;ref name="Sunderland sign Ipswich striker Connor Wickham"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/13873800.stm| title = Sunderland sign Ipswich striker Connor Wickham| publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate = 29 June 2011| date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee broke Ipswich's record for transfer fees recouped, and broke the transfer record for a Football League player moving to a Premier League club. Ipswich's chief executive Simon Clegg summed it up:
{{Cquote|As much as we would have liked to have kept Connor at Portman Road we have to be realistic and recognise that the offer from Sunderland was simply too good to turn down.|||Simon Clegg|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10272~2383584,00.html|title=Wickham leaves Town in record move|date=29 June 2011|publisher=Ipswich Town F.C.|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903144841/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10272~2383584%2C00.html|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He scored his first goal for Sunderland in a pre-season friendly against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. Wickham made his first competitive appearance for Sunderland when he came on as a substitute in the 1–0 defeat to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Tyne–Wear derby]] on 20 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14514549.stm|title=Sunderland 0–1 Newcastle|author=Alistair Magowan|date=21 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start for Sunderland on 22 October 2011 where he helped Sunderland secure their second win of the season against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15319551.stm|title=Bolton 0–2 Sunderland|first=Becky|last= Ashton|date=22 October 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickham scored his first Premier League goal for the ''Black Cats'' a week later in the 2–2 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. The following week against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], Wickham suffered a knee injury and had to be substituted just five minutes into the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/7294582/Injury-woe-for-Wickham |title=Injury woe for Wickham| work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of new manager [[Martin O'Neill]] saw Wickham fall out of favour as he spent the majority of the remainder of the season on the bench and playing for the reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spellman |first=Damian |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/martin-oneill-challenges-sunderland-striker-connor-wickham-to-take-his-chance-8428851.html |title=Martin O'Neill challenges Sunderland striker Connor Wickham to take his chance |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham came off the bench at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the third round of the [[2012–13 FA Cup|FA Cup]] to score his first goal of the season as Sunderland came from 2–0 down to earn a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cartwright |first=Phil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20863471 |title=Bolton 2–2 Sunderland |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan spells====
On 8 February 2013, Wickham joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on loan, initially on a one-month deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21383420 | title = Connor Wickham: Sheffield Wednesday secure loan deal | date = 8 February 2013 | accessdate = 8 February 2013 | publisher = BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 9 February, in a 2–2 draw against Derby County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311544 "Sheffield Wed 2–2 Derby"] BBC Sport. 9 February 2013.

On 27 August 2013, Wickham inspired Sunderland to a late comeback against [[MK Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in the [[2013–14 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]], scoring twice and assisting [[Jozy Altidore]]'s goal as the Premier League side scored four times in the last 20 minutes to win 4–2.

On 1 November 2013, Wickham re-joined Sheffield Wednesday in another loan move until 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wickham signs |url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/news/article/wickham-signs-1148390.aspx |work=www.swfc.co.uk |date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham scored on his return in the 5–2 win over Reading at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] on 2 November. Wickham again appeared on the score sheet scoring a brace of goals in the 2–1 win over Leicester City on 3 December. Four goals in four games in December 2013 earned Wickham a nomination for the December Championship Player of the Month award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/20140109/player-of-the-month-nominations_2293322_3610119&lt;/ref&gt; but he ultimately lost out to Leicester City's Danny Drinkwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatsleepsport.com/leicester-city/drinkwater-gets-monthly-award-1692866.html#.Us_FpPZAKHk|title=EatSleepSport|website=www.eatsleepsport.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2013, his loan spell at Wednesday was extended by a further month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25561786|title=Connor Wickham extends Sheffield Wednesday loan|date=31 December 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his parent club prevented him from representing the ''Owls'' in the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-wednesday/sheffield-wednesday-owls-connor-blow-1-6346262&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2014, he scored in Wednesday's 6–0 win over Yorkshire rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-utd/sheffield-wednesday-6-leeds-united-0-wednesday-wipe-out-22-years-of-hurt-with-destruction-of-leeds-1-6368579|title=Sheffield Wednesday 6 Leeds United 0: Wednesday wipe out 22 years of hurt with destruction of Leeds|website=www.yorkshirepost.co.uk|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, he described the win as a "fantastic team performance" while saying that he was "unhappy with my own personal performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ConnorWickham10|author=Connor Wickham|number=422033957568651264|date=11 January 2014|title=Unhappy with my personal performance today but buzzing for @clavery13 deserved his goals!

====Return to Sunderland====
On 24 March, Wickham was recalled from his loan after playing four games for Leeds to bolster Sunderland's goal scoring options, with Steven Fletcher injured and [[Jozy Altidore]] badly out of form.

On 16 April, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Manchester City at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26716896 "Manchester City 2–2 Sunderland"] BBC Sport. 16 April 2014.

===Crystal Palace===
On 3 August 2015, Wickham joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wickham Moves South |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/august/wickham-moves-south/ |publisher=Crystal Palace FC |date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources reported it as an initial £7 million, rising to a potential £9 million depending upon his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace sign striker Connor Wickham from Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33756128|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham made his debut on 8 August 2015 as a second-half substitute in the 3–1 win at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Norwich City 1–3 Crystal Palace|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/august/report-norwich-city-1-3-crystal-palace/|date=8 August 2015|website=cpfc.co.uk|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Wickham sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of first-team action until October 2018.

==International career==
Wickham is eligible for Northern Ireland, as his father is Northern Irish meaning that until he receives a full cap from [[England national football team|England]] in a competitive game he is still eligible for the national team. His progress in the English Premier League was also being monitored by former Republic of Ireland management duo of [[Martin O'Neill]] and [[Roy Keane]].&lt;ref&gt;Irish Independent Weekender Magazine 26 April 2024&lt;/ref&gt; His links to Northern Ireland mean that he also qualifies to play for the Republic of Ireland though there are no reports of Wickham having been approached by current manager Mick McCarthy.&lt;ref name="Speck"/&gt;

===England U16===
Wickham has represented the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16]] team and was also on stand-by for the [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] squad during the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref name="Profiles - Connor Wickham"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10272~46161,00.html | title = Profiles – Connor Wickham | publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 11 April 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090427135335/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0%2C%2C10272~46161%2C00.html | archivedate = 27 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the 2008 [[Victory Shield]] with England, scoring in the 2–0 final win over Scotland.

===England U17===
On 11 August 2009, Wickham received a call-up to the [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 squad]], for their three-game FA International Tournament, which would take place later that month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simply-blue.co.uk/viewtopic.php?id=826 Wickham Gets England Call]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Simply-Blue. Retrieved 13 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Wickham was included in the [[England national under-17 football team|England U17]] squad for the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|UEFA European U17 Championship]] in [[Liechtenstein]]. He was involved in two of the goals in England's 3–1 win against the [[Czech Republic national under-17 football team|Czech Republic]] in the group stage, with a convincing performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/under17/matches/season=2010/round=15342/match=2002332/report/ | title = England flex muscles against Czechs | publisher = UEFA | accessdate = 22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played the full game in the second group match against [[Greece national under-17 football team|Greece]], once again playing well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u17s/News/match-centre/2010/Greece%20v%20England/210510# | title = Barkley banks semi spot | publisher = The Football Association | accessdate = 22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham was rested for the final group game of the tournament, but returned to face [[France national youth football team|France]] in the semi-final. He scored both goals for England in a 2–1 victory, both left-footed, and both in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u17s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvFrance/Report | title = Wickham brace sends England into Final | publisher = The Football Association | accessdate = 27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham scored the winner in a 2–1 victory over [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]] in the final. He received the ball on the edge of the box before proceeding to beat two defenders and drill the ball low into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1282660/England-youngsters-seniors-claiming-UEFA-Under-17-title.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | title = England youngsters show the seniors how it's done by claiming UEFA Under 17 title | publisher = The Daily Mail | accessdate = 30 May 2010 | location=London | first=Neil | last=Moxley | date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the Golden Player award by UEFA for the best player in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/history/season=2010/goldenplayer/index.html|title=2010: Connor Wickham|accessdate=18 May 2014|work=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Wickham in the England youth set-up, speculation began to mount about him winning a senior cap, and possibly even being included in [[Fabio Capello]]'s [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup squad]] – although seemingly a longshot. Former England defender [[Russell Osman]] said:

{{Cquote|Of course people will question why Capello would take Wickham to the World Cup but my reply would be, "Why not?" [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] picked [[Theo Walcott]] four years ago and he was 17 with even less experience than Wickham.|||Russell Osman|"&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;''}}

===England U21===
[[File:Connor Wickham England U21.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|Wickham playing for England Under 21s in 2012]]
On 7 September 2010, England under-21 boss, [[Stuart Pearce]] admitted that he had been monitoring Wickham's progress, and that he would consider calling him up to the under-21 squad once he had recovered from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pearce well aware of Wickham | newspaper = [[Yahoo! Sports]] | date = 7 September 2010 | url = http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/07092010/63/pearce-well-aware-wickham.html | accessdate = 8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2010 Pearce did name Wickham in the [[England under-21 national football team|under-21s]] friendly match against Germany on 16 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=17388|title=Wickham Called Up to England U21s - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that game he came on as a 66th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat for England. Following that game, and the important experience Wickham gained, he returned to the England under-19 side. However, it would not be long before he was back in the fold for the under-21s.

On 14 March 2011, it was announced that Wickham had been included in the squad for England's games against Denmark and Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18065|title=Wickham in England U21 Squad - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as a substitute in the game against Denmark, which England went on to win 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/sturridge-stands-out-as-england-romp-to-40-victory-2252547.html|title=Sturridge stands out as England romp to 4-0 victory|date=25 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following Monday, Wickham started the game in a friendly against Iceland at [[Deepdale Stadium|Deepdale]] in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. It was his first start for the under-21s, and he played the full 90 minutes as England lost the game 2–1 to a very strong Iceland side that consisted of a number of first team regulars. Wickham played as a lone striker in the game.

Prior to the Iceland game, Wickham admitted that he was hopeful of being included in the squad that would play in the summer's Euro 2011 under-21s [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|tournament]] due to take place in June. Having been an instrumental figure in the success of the under-17's the previous summer, he felt he could repeat the feat at a higher level. He said:

{{Cquote|It would be another summer tournament, and I want to win another tournament. It'll be different, but if we play to the potential that is in our team we are capable of beating anyone on our day. All the boys have taken me as part of the team and have treated me no differently to anyone else. They are a great bunch of lads and I'd be happy to spend the summer with them. Even just to be selected would be brilliant but to win it would be better. I don't see why we can't go on and really push this summer to win the tournament.|||Connor Wickham|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2011/EnglandIceland/Match-Previews/connor-wickham|title=The website for the English football association, the Emirates FA Cup and the England football team|first=The Football|last=Association|website=www.thefa.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''}}

He scored his first goal for the under-21s on 10 September 2012, scoring the only goal of the game in a win against [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norway]] in [[Chesterfield]], ensuring England won their European Under-21 Championship qualifying group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19547219 "England U-21 1–0 Norway U-21"] BBC Sport. 10 September 2012. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second goal on 16 October, helping England to a 2–0 aggregate win in the play-off against [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19944974 "Serbia U21 0–1 England U21"] BBC Sport. 16 October 2012.

In January 2019, Batshuayi's loan to Valencia was cut short and he joined English Premier League club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2019/february/michy-batshuayi-joins-palace-on-loan/|title=Michy Batshuayi Joins Palace on Loan|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47081617|title=Michy Batshuayi: Crystal Palace sign Chelsea striker on loan until end of season|work=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 2 February in a home 2–0 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], providing an assist for [[Jeffrey Schlupp]] to score the second goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benteke eager to become the new partner for 'Batman'|last=Collings|first=Simon|work=[[Evening Standard]]|location =London|date=4 February 2019|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February, Batshuayi scored his first goal for Crystal Palace in 4–1 win against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.in/football/report?gameId=513571|website=espn.in|title=Crystal Palace rout Leicester to step up pressure on Puel|date=23 February 2019|accessdate=5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:ENG-BEL (28).jpg|thumb|right|Batshuayi playing for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Batshuayi was eligible to play for the [[DR Congo national football team|DR Congo national team]] through his parents, but in March 2015, he ruled out this option, stating that although his Congolese heritage is important to him, he would rather represent [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/05/olympique-marseilles-michy-batshuayi-chooses-belgium-over-dr-congo/|title=Olympique Marseille’s Michy Batshuayi Chooses Belgium Over DR Congo|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Caught Offside|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batshuayi made his international debut for Belgium on 28 March 2015 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]]. Replacing [[Christian Benteke]] in the 77th minute, he scored from outside the penalty area three minutes later to seal a 5–0 victory at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scholten|first1=Berend|title=Classy Belgium too strong for Cyprus|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013931/postmatch/report/|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=UEFA|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] in France, making his competition debut in the last 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Toulouse]] on 26 June. With his first touch, he finished [[Eden Hazard]]'s assist for the second goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2016: Hungary 0 Belgium 4 – Alderweireld, Hazard, Batshuayi and Carrasco goals set up quarter-final against Wales|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/26/hungary-v-belgium-euro-2016-live/|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Batshuayi scored once in a 4–3 win away to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 7 October 2017, with the ''Red Devils'' already assured of their place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Vaishali|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina 3 Belgium 4: Vertonghen and Batshuayi on target as Fellaini forced off with knee injury|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/bosniaherzegovina-3-belgium-4-vertonghen-and-batshuayi-on-target-as-fellaini-forced-off-with-knee-a3653036.html|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=Evening Standard|date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Roberto Martínez]] named him in the 23-man squad to go to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Belgium include Vincent Kompany but Christian Benteke misses out |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44353673 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their second group stage match, he came on as a 68th-minute substitute against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and missed several chances before finally scoring the fifth goal for Belgium in a 5–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Massart |first1=Simon |title=Batshuayi's perseverance pays dividends |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/batshuayi-perseverance-pays-dividends-2966457 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=FIFA |date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A December 2015 profiling by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' likened Batshuayi for his speed, strength, positioning and link-up play to [[Didier Drogba]], despite being shorter than the Ivorian.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

==Personal life==
Batshuayi is nicknamed "Batsman", a play on the name of the superhero [[Batman]].&lt;ref name=batsman/&gt; His younger brother [[Aaron Leya Iseka]] plays for Toulouse in the same position, coming through at Anderlecht and signing for Marseille on loan, one month after Batshuayi's exit.&lt;ref name=bfm&gt;{{cite news |title=OM : cinq choses à savoir sur Aaron Leya Iseka, le petit frère de Michy Batshuayi|trans-title=OM: five things to know about Aaron Leya Iseka, Michy Batshuayi's little brother |url=https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/om-cinq-choses-a-savoir-sur-aaron-leya-iseka-le-petit-frere-de-michy-1030312.html |accessdate=11 August 2018 |publisher=BFM |date=27 August 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Sako had been with [[LB Châteauroux|Châteauroux]] since 2001, joining the club as an academy player. He made his league debut on the final matchday of the [[2005-06 Ligue 2|2005–06 Ligue 2 season]] coming on as a half-time substitute in a 4–1 victory over [[SC Bastia|Bastia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2005/2006&amp;code_evt=D2&amp;code_jr_tr=J38&amp;num_ordre=1 Bastia v.

Retrieved on 29 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2008–09 Ligue 2|2008–09 season]] Sako became an integral part of the team, helping the club narrowly avoid relegation on the final day.

===Saint-Étienne===
On 9 July 2009, Sako departed Châteauroux for [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Saint-Étienne]], where he signed a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
[[File:Bakary Sako.jpg|thumb|left|Sako playing for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]], 2014]]

On 29 August 2012, Sako signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee that was reported to be £2.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19409743 |title=Wolves sign Bakary Sako from St Etienne on three-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pleads for move to Fulham"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/29/wolverhampton-wanderers-bakary-sako-fulham |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers' Bakary Sako pleads for move to Fulham |publisher=The Observer |date=29 June 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his Wolves debut in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]] on 30 August 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19352817|title=Northampton 1–3 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on his league debut in the following match, a 3–1 defeat at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19384124|title=Cardiff 3–1 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winger adapted well to English football, scoring ten times in total and contributing eleven assists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/91494/bakary-sako?cc=5739#|title=Bakary Sako|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his season was halted early when he tore his hamstring in March 2013 in a match against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21831205|title=Bakary Sako &amp; Dave Edwards: Wolves await injury diagnosis|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ruled him out for much of the season's final games, during which the team were relegated to League One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2013/03/25/wolves-trio-carl-ikeme-bakary-sako-and-dave-edwards-ruled-out-for-the-season/|title=Wolves trio Carl Ikeme, Bakary Sako and Dave Edwards ruled out for the season|publisher=Express &amp; Star|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sako was the subject of transfer speculation during Summer 2013 with interest from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in June 2013 but the London club did not meet a reported £4 million asking price.&lt;ref name="pleads for move to Fulham"/&gt; Owing to his uncertain future, the player did not play in Wolves' final match of the transfer window as he "didn't feel he was in the right frame of mind".&lt;ref name="Forest bid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2013/09/01/wolves-turn-down-nottingham-forest-bakary-sako-bid/|title=Wolves turn down Nottingham Forest Bakary Sako bid|publisher=Express &amp; Star|date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reported bids from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] were rejected by the club.&lt;ref name="Forest bid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2013/09/03/wolves-reject-3-5m-bid-for-bakary-sako/?|title=Wolves reject £3.5m bid for Bakary Sako|publisher=Shropshire Star|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Forest again attempted to set up a deal but Wolves pulled out of negotiations citing that "the terms surrounding the offer were unrealistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-bakary-sako-041013-1094696.aspx|title=Club Statement: Bakary Sako|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=4 October 2013|access-date=4 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004111816/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-bakary-sako-041013-1094696.aspx#|archive-date=4 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial speculation surrounding his future and the breakdown of his proposed move to Forest, Sako went on to have a productive season for Wolves, finishing as joint top-scorer alongside the departed [[Leigh Griffiths]] as Wolves won the [[EFL League One|League One]] title with a record points haul for the third tier. Sako was also named in the League One [[PFA Team of the Year]] for the 2013–14 season alongside four of his teammates.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1314&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27180793 |title=Luis Suarez: Liverpool striker wins PFA Player of the Year award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back at Championship level, Sako continued to score regularly for Wolves and was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1415&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32473770 |title=PFA Championship Team of the Year: Deeney only Watford player |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 April 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season as the club's (joint) top goalscorer as the team missed out on the play-offs on goal difference. Out of contract with the club, he voiced his desire to play in the Premier League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-bakary-sako-041013-1094696.aspx|title=Sako thanks for support|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=4 May 2015|access-date=4 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004111816/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-bakary-sako-041013-1094696.aspx#|archive-date=4 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while head coach Kenny Jackett stated that he expected Sako to depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gaffer-expects-sako-to-move-on-2436574.aspx|title=Gaffer expects Sako to move on|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=2 May 2015|access-date=31 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062105/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gaffer-expects-sako-to-move-on-2436574.aspx#|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 5 August 2015, Sako joined [[Premier League]] side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a three-year contract following his release from Wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sako Signs Eagles Deal|date=5 August 2015|website=cpfc.co.uk|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/august/sako-signs-eagles-deal/|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on his full debut against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 22 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace 2–1 Aston Villa|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33944695|accessdate=27 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sako then scored again the following week away to Chelsea, in a 2–1 win, which was [[José Mourinho]]'s second ever loss at Stamford Bridge. Sako also assisted the second goal scored by [[Joel Ward (footballer)|Joel Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ronay|first1=Barney|title=Chelsea humbled at home after Sako and Ward strike for Crystal Palace|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/29/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017–18 season, Sako's form started to pick up under the management of [[Roy Hodgson]] scoring his first goal of the season against Huddersfield in the [[EFL Cup]]. He later scored against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in the same competition. Sako was also back scoring in the league as well, netting against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]]. He also added a goal in the [[FA Cup]] in an away loss to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McInnes|first1=Paul|title=Crystal Palace revival continues as Bakary Sako strikes against Burnley|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/13/crystal-palace-burnley-premier-league-report|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Return of the Bak: How Bakary Sako Resurrected His Crystal Palace Career|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/01/15/return-bak-how-bakary-sako-resurrected-his-crystal-palace-career|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=Sports Illustrated|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lea|first1=Greg|title=How Bakary Sako Went From Bit-Part Player To Guaranteed Starter – And Top Scorer – At Crystal Palace|url=https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/how-bakary-sako-went-from-bit-part-player-to-guaranteed-starter-and-top-scorer-at-crystal-palace|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=The Sportsman|date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2019, Sako rejoined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a short-term contract until the end of the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2019/january/bakary-sako-returns-to-palace-on-short-term-deal/|title=Bakary Sako has rejoined Crystal Palace until the end of the season|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=27 January 2019|accessdate=27 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth===
Sako played for the [[Mali national under-17 football team|Malian U17 team]] in one friendly match in 2005, while the team was preparing for the [[2005 African Under-17 Championship]]. The following year, he returned to the [[France national youth football team|French team]] playing with the [[France national youth football team#France national under-18 squad|under-18 squad]]. He was a member of the French squad that participated in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|2007 European Under-19 Championship]] reaching the semi-finals before being eliminated by [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. He made his [[France national under-21 football team|French under-21]] debut on 11 February 2009 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]. He scored his first under-21 goal in the [[2009 Toulon Tournament]] against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]].

===Senior===
[[File:20150331 Mali vs Ghana 063.jpg|thumb|Bakary Sako during [[Mali national football team|Mali]]-[[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in March 2015.]]
Sako was called up by the [[Mali national football team|Malian national team]] for the first time for a friendly against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] on 5 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali call-up for Wolves winger Bakary Sako|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2014/02/28/mali-call-up-for-wolves-winger-bakary-sako/|publisher=Express and Star |date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first international goal against [[Guinea national football team|Guinea]] in a friendly match played in [[Colombes]], France, on 25 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national-football-teams.com/matches/report/10596/Mali_Guinea.html Mali vs. Guinea (1:2)]. National Football Teams (27 April 2015). Retrieved 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal in competitive internationals came when he scored the opener in a 2–0 win over [[Malawi national football team|Malawi]] in an [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification#Group B|Africa Cup of Nations qualification]] match played in [[Bamako]] on 7 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ten-man Mali hold on to defeat Malawi in Afcon qualifier |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29103857 |publisher=BBC |date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national-football-teams.com/player/54821/Bakary_Sako.html Bakary Sako]. National Football Teams. Retrieved on 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2014 Sako was called up to the Mali squad for the finals of the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] to be held in [[Equatorial Guinea]] in January 2015. This was to be his first taste of a senior international tournament.

Sako started Mali's first two matches in group D of the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[Equatorial Guinea]]. These both finished in 1–1 draws, against [[Cameroon]] on 20 January and against [[Ivory Coast]] on 24 January. Sako scored a left-foot half-volley against Ivory Coast that the BBC hailed as the goal of the tournament at that point. Sako was unable to start the final and decisive group game against [[Guinea]] due to an illness though he did appear from the bench for the final 15 minutes of the game. This too ended in a 1–1 stalemate, meaning that five of the six games in group D finished 1–1 and this led to the drawing of lots between Mali and Guinea to decide who qualified for the quarter finals and who went home. It was Guinea who emerged from the hat, meaning the Eagles exited the tournament unbeaten.

In [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10]], with Sánchez having renewed his link a further year and the signing of [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]]'s [[Miguel Ángel Moyá]], Guaita was deemed surplus to requirements and joined, on loan, [[Segunda División]]'s [[Recreativo de Huelva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hortanoticias.com/noticia/373868/Torrent/guardameta-vicente-guaita-jugar%C3%A1-cedido-valencia-cf-recreativo-huelva.html|title=El guardameta Vicente Guaita jugará cedido por el Valencia CF en el Recreativo de Huelva|trans-title=Goalkeeper Vicente Guaita will play with Recreativo de Huelva on loan from Valencia CF|publisher=Horta Noticias|language=Spanish|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=22 January 2013|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216053550/http://www.hortanoticias.com/noticia/373868/Torrent/guardameta-vicente-guaita-jugar%C3%A1-cedido-valencia-cf-recreativo-huelva.html|archive-date=16 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Andalusia]]ns [[2009–10 Segunda División|finished comfortably in mid-table]] he was awarded the competition's [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]], with just 24 goals conceded in 30 appearances.&lt;ref name=ZAMORA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huelva.eldesmarque.com/recreativo/22495-guaita-ya-es-el-zamora-de-la-categoria|title=Guaita ya es el Zamora de la Segunda División|trans-title=Guaita is already the Zamora in ''Segunda División''|publisher=El Desmarque|first=Álvaro|last=Ramírez|language=Spanish|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November–December 2010, profiting from injuries to both César and Moyà, Guaita had a run of several matches for Valencia, notably a 2–1 home win against [[UD Almería|Almería]] in [[La Liga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/301980/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739|title=Soldado at the double for Valencia|website=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|1–1 draw]] away to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/307806/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739|title=Anderson makes precious point|website=ESPN Soccernet|date=7 December 2010|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2011, as he had established himself in the starting XI, he suffered the loss of his father due to a heart attack (aged only 46),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcfcentral.com/latest-news/mata-we-scored-quickly-and-that-gave-us-confidence/|title=Mata: We scored quickly, and that gave us confidence|website=VCF Central|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=10 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322134448/http://vcfcentral.com/latest-news/mata-we-scored-quickly-and-that-gave-us-confidence/|archivedate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting manager Emery to reinstate César between the posts for two games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/futbol/noticias/2959026/04/11/Cesar-se-convierte-en-el-portero-con-mas-edad-que-juega-en-Primera.html|title=César se convierte en el portero con más edad que juega en Primera|trans-title=César becomes oldest goalkeeper to play in ''Primera''|newspaper=[[El Economista (Spain)|El Economista]]|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Guaita extended his contract with Valencia until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2011/05/31/guaita-queria-familia-anos-posibles/129684.html|title=Guaita: 'Tenía claro que quería quedarme en el VCF'|trans-title=Guaita: 'I was sure i wanted to stay with VCF'|newspaper=Super Deporte|location=Valencia|language=Spanish|date=31 May 2011|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begun [[2011–12 La Liga|the season]] as the starter, but picked up a serious hand injury in early November 2011, being nonetheless selected to several games by Emery as the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2011/12/21/mano-vuelve-frenar-guaita/148219.html|title=La mano vuelve a frenar a Guaita|trans-title=Hand stops Guaita again|newspaper=Super Deporte|location=Valencia|language=Spanish|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/01/04/futbol/equipos/valencia/1325669207.html|title=Guaita sólo para emergencias|trans-title=Guaita for emergencies only|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|first=D.|last=Picó|first2=D.|last2=Puig|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Getafe===

On 31 July 2014, Guaita was sold to [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] with a buy-back option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valenciacf.com/ver/36608/comunicado-oficial---traspaso-de-vicente-guaita-al-getafe-cf-.html|title=Comunicado oficial – Traspaso de Vicente Guaita al Getafe CF|trans-title=Official announcement – Transfer of Vicente Guaita to Getafe CF|publisher=Valencia CF|language=Spanish|date=31 July 2014|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for his new team on 24 August, in a 1–3 away loss to [[RC Celta de Vigo|Celta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espanol.eurosport.com/futbol/liga/2014-2015/en-vivo-celta-getafe-2100_sto4371941/story.shtml|title=Celta-Getafe: El mejor tridente para empezar (3–1)|trans-title=Celta-Getafe: The best trio to start (3–1)|publisher=[[Eurosport]]|language=Spanish|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016–17 Segunda División|2016–17 campaign]], with the club again in the second level, Guaita played little due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/futbol/getafe/2016/09/27/57ea990f268e3e61298b4615.html|title=Guaita estará un mes y medio de baja por una lesión en la muñeca|trans-title=Guaita will be out for one and a half months due to a wrist injury|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=27 September 2016|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/futbol/getafe-cf/792683-guaita-es-el-todo-u-otra-temporada-en-segunda.html|title=Guaita: "Es el todo u otra temporada en Segunda"|trans-title=Guaita: "Anything goes or another season in ''Segunda'' it is"|publisher=[[Vavel]]|first=Elena María|last=Pintado Nieto|language=Spanish|date=25 May 2017|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, the starter in [[2017 Segunda División play-offs|the play-offs]], which ended in promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/futbol/segunda-division/2017/06/14/5941a291ca4741df0d8b460b.html|title=El Huesca no se rinde y levanta dos goles para soñar con la final|trans-title=Huesca do not surrender and come back from two goals to dream with final|newspaper=Marca|first=Juancar|last=Navacerrada|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/futbol/segunda-division/2017/06/17/59459713ca474116058b4613.html|title=El Getafe arrasa al Huesca y está en la final|trans-title=Getafe destroy Huesca and are already in the final|newspaper=Marca|first=Juancar|last=Navacerrada|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=17 June 2017|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/deportes/noticia/tenerife-gana-getafe-partido-ida-ascenso-primera-3071429/0/|title=El Tenerife da el primer paso hacia el ascenso al derrotar al Getafe en la ida con gol de Jorge|trans-title=Tenerife take first step towards promotion after defeating Getafe in first leg with goal from Jorge|newspaper=[[20 minutos]]|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=22 June 2017|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2017/06/24/actualidad/1498332522_361003.html|title=El Getafe regresa a Primera tras ganar al Tenerife (3–1)|trans-title=Getafe return to ''Primera'' after beating Tenerife (3–1)|newspaper=El País|first=Ladislao J.|last=Moñino|location=Madrid|language=Spanish|date=24 June 2017|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1897 Sam Woods.jpg|thumb|Sam Woods]]
'''Sam Woods''' (10 May 1846 – 23 November 1915) was a British trade unionist and politician who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) in the 1890s.

Born at [[Peasley Cross]] in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], Woods began working in [[coal mining]] at the age of seven.  He was elected as a pit [[checkweighman]] in 1875 and became strongly involved in trade unionism, joining the [[Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation]] in 1881.  When this merged into the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] (MFGB) in 1889, Woods became the organisation's first vice president.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892|1892 general election]], Woods was elected as a [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib–Lab]] MP for [[Ince (UK Parliament constituency)|Ince]].  In Parliament, he agitated for the [[Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908|Eight Hours Bill]], and in 1894 he was elected as the [[General Secretary of the TUC|Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee]] of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC).  He lost his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]], but was re-elected for [[Walthamstow (UK Parliament constituency)|Walthamstow]] at a [[Walthamstow by-election, 1897|by-election in 1897]].  However, he lost the seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900]] following confusion over his stance on the [[Second Boer War]].

While broadly supportive of the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]], Woods remained a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and joined the [[National Democratic League]].  His health failing, he resigned his TUC post in 1904, but retained his vice presidency of the MFGB to prevent [[Robert Smillie]] gaining election.

An elderly persons home is named after him in [[Ashton in Makerfield]].

==Club career==

===AFC Ajax===
====2013–14====
On 15 March 2013, Riedewald signed his first professional contract with Ajax, a product of the [[Ajax Youth Academy]] having joined the club from [[SV Overbos]] at the age of 11. His first contract with the club was a three-year contract binding him to the club until 2016. On 21 December 2013 he made his professional debut in the [[Eerste Divisie]], the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands, playing for the reserves team [[Jong Ajax]], in a match against [[VVV-Venlo]] which ended in a 5–1 away loss.

On 14 December 2013, Ajax head coach [[Frank de Boer]] announced the inclusion of Riedewald in the first team squad for the away match against [[SC Cambuur]] on 15 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/194386/Riedewald-in-selectie-voor-duel-Cambuur.htm Riedewald in selectie voor duel Cambuur] Ajax.nl, 14 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Not having made an appearance in that fixture it was the first time he was called for the first team. He made his debut for the first team on 19 December 2013 in the [[KNVB Cup]] match against [[IJsselmeervogels]]. The match ended in a 3–0 away win, with Riedewald coming on for [[Daley Blind]] in the 73rd minute of the match. Three days later he made his [[Eredivisie]] debut against [[Roda JC Kerkrade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/118276/17-jarige-riedewald-maakt-ajax-winterkampioen 17-jarige Riedewald maakt Ajax winterkampioen] AT5.nl, 22 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bojan Krkić]], Riedewald was substituted on as well in the 80th minute, where he replaced [[Christian Poulsen]], quickly scoring two goals, after trailing 1–0, helping Ajax to a 2–1 away victory, hereby becoming the youngest scoring debutant in the club and league history with 17 years, 104 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Droomdebuut Riedewald laat Ajax ontsnappen in Kerkrade|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/droomdebuut-riedewald-laat-ajax-ontsnappen-in-kerkrade.htm|publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=22 December 2013|language=Dutch|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest scoring player before him in the Dutch Eredivise was [[Jeroen Lumu]] with 17 years, 111 days, while [[Marco van Basten]] was the youngest scoring debutant at the club with 17 year, 154 days of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/ajax/22160580/__Riedewald_breekt_record__.html Riedewald breekt record] telegraaf.nl, 22 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2014 Riedewald became a permanent member of the first team at Ajax. On 27 February 2014, Riedewald made his continental debut for Ajax in the [[UEFA Europa League]] away match against [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] which resulted in a 3–1 loss where he replaced Christian Poulsen in the 63rd minute.

====2014–15====
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}

====2015–16====
[[File:Jairo Riedewald 2016.jpg|thumb|Riedewald training with Ajax in 2016]]
After [[Niklas Moisander]] departed the club at the start of the 2015-16 season, Ajax manager [[Frank de Boer]] decided to choose Riedewald as the new partner of [[Joël Veltman]] in central defense. In [[de Klassieker]] against [[Feyenoord]] on 7 February 2016, Riedewald got injured soon after kick-off; he had broken his left ankle, which meant his season was finished. Until that moment, he had only missed one league game due to suspension. He returned early from injury on 1 May 2016, replacing [[Kenny Tete]] in the 76th minute in a match against [[FC Twente]].

====2016–17====
After Ajax lost the Eredivisie title to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on the last matchday of the season by drawing to [[De Graafschap]], manager De Boer decided to leave the club. His successor [[Peter Bosz]] decided to use Riedewald more as a defensive midfielder during the opening of the season. On 15 September 2016, Riedewald scored the rebound of [[Davy Klaassen]]'s missed penalty in a Europa League match against [[Panathinaikos]], his first goal for Ajax since his debut match.

===Crystal Palace===
In July 2017, Riedewald signed a five-year contract with [[Premier League]] side Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/july/riedewald-signs-for-palace/|title=Riedewald Signs For Palace|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Riedewald received his first call up to the senior [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands team]] in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blind names first Netherlands squad: Tete, Riedewald and Anita included|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/blind-names-first-netherlands-squad-tete-riedewald-and-anita-included/|accessdate=1 September 2015|publisher=football-oranje.com|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, he made his official debut for Oranje against Turkey.

==Personal life==
Born in Haarlem, Riedewald is of mixed [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Suriname]]se and [[Indonesia]]n heritage. His father hails from Suriname, while his mother is of half Dutch, half Indonesian descent. This was revealed in an interview with Riedewald prior to the off-season tour of Indonesia in 2014 by AFC Ajax of Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riedewald keert terug naar roots|url=http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuws-artikel/196575/Riedewald-keert-terug-naar-roots.htm|publisher=Ajax.nl|accessdate=25 June 2014|language=Dutch|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jarosław Przemysław Jach''' (born 17 February 1994) is a Polish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]] of the [[Moldovan National Division]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|CrystalP}} club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Although his mother Lucyna originally wanted him to be a swimmer, young Jarosław always was more of a football fan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He started his career in a local club [[Pogoń Pieszyce]], where he played until his friend helped him earn a transfer to [[Lechia Dzierżoniów]]. With time he established himself as one of the most important figures in the club and was often chosen as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the team and took [[Direct free kick|free kicks]] even though he wasn't even 20 years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Zagłębie Lubin===
He signed with [[Zagłębie Lubin]] in 2013 and after a year of playing in the reserve team, he made his debut in Polish top division on May 27, 2014 against [[Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała]], coming on as substitute for [[Đorđe Čotra]] in 74th minute of the match.

The club eventually got relegated and started the 2014–15 season in second division. Jach made 13 appearances, helping the side to promotion.

In 2015–16 season, he scored his first goal in a 2-1 win over Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała on 22 November 2015. He helped his team to win a bronze medal in that season.

In the 2016–17 season and the departure of [[Maciej Dąbrowski]] to [[Legia Warsaw]], he became a regular starter for Zagłębie and proved to be a crucial part of the team's defense, which turned out to be the 5th in the league. A series of performances however, was stopped by an injury which caused him to pause for 3 months.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Crystal Palace===
Jach signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 23 January 2018 on a three-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42796432|title=Jaroslaw Jach: Crystal Palace sign Poland centre-back from Zagłebie Lubin|last=|first=|date=23 January 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=23 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Çaykur Rizespor (loan)====
In July 2018, Jach joined Turkish [[Süper Lig]] side [[Çaykur Rizespor]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] until the end of the 2018–19 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2018/july/jach-moves-on-loan-to-caykur-rizespor/|title=Jach Moves on Loan to Caykur Rizespor|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his loan was ended early, in February 2019, after he made only five league appearances for the side.

====Sheriff Tiraspol (loan)====
Following his departure from Rizespor, Jach joined Moldovan side [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]] on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canalplus.pl/sport/news-jaroslaw-jach-w-sheriffie_781038|title=Jarosław Jach w Sheriffie (2019/02/02)|website=www.canalplus.pl|language=pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fc-sheriff.com/en/vse/welcome-jaroslaw/|title=Welcome, Jaroslaw|website=FC Sheriff|access-date=2019-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jason David Ian Puncheon''' (born 18 June 1986)&lt;!-- See talk page --&gt; is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], on loan from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Following his goal against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on his [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] debut, he has scored in all of the top four divisions of English league football, scoring for [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in [[EFL League One|League One]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and Blackpool, Southampton and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Croydon]], Greater London, Puncheon began his career with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], and moved [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|with the team]] to Milton Keynes, where the club became [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in 2004. He was released in January 2006. He moved to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in June of the same year, after brief spells with [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] and [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]].&lt;ref name="whoswho07"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hugman |first=Barry |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2007–08 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84596-246-3 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[FA Cup]] Player of the Third Round in 2007 and the following season after scoring a succession of brilliant goals (including a last minute 35-yard free kick versus Bradford) was named in the PFA Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="FAC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6271595.stm |title=Puncheon nets FA Cup player award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plymouth Argyle===
[[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] signed Puncheon from Barnet for £250,000 in 2008. He endured an unsuccessful 18-month spell at the club, making six league appearances. He was loaned to former club MK Dons three times in two years, where he scored 11 goals in 51 appearances.

===Southampton===
On 30 January 2010, Puncheon joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] which then led to his loan deal at MK Dons to be cut short.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~1949524,00.html |title=Puncheon joins Saints |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201051858/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~1949524%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in a 5–1 victory over Walsall, and scored again a few days later, in a 5–0 victory over Huddersfield.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, he was a regular in the first team. However, when [[Alan Pardew]] lost his job just days after a 4–0 win away to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], Southampton hired [[Nigel Adkins]] as manager. Under Adkins, he stayed in the first team, but found himself under increasing pressure from [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] for his place. Eventually Adkins lost patience with Puncheon's erratic performances, and dropped him to the bench in favour of 17-year-old Chamberlain, who was later sold to Arsenal for a reported £15m. On 16 November 2010, Puncheon moved on an emergency loan deal to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jason To Join Lions |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2222518,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=17 November 2010 |date=16 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119000200/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~2222518%2C00.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on his first game for Millwall in their 1–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Millwall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9194875.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 December 2010 |date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2011, Puncheon scored a [[hat-trick]] in the 3–0 victory over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millwall 3–0 Crystal Palace |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9322923.stm |accessdate=1 January 2011 |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season with a 30-yard volley in a league cup win at [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]. He scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton in a 4–1 home victory against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. His second came when Southampton won 3–1 away to Queens Park Rangers.

===Crystal Palace===
On 21 August 2013, Puncheon signed a one-year loan with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2013/august/palace-sign-puncheon-on-loan/ |title=Palace sign Puncheon on loan |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed a penalty as Palace lost 2–0 away to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 11 January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25600519 |title=Tottenham 2–0 Crystal Palace |first=Timothy |last=Abraham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made up for his miss by scoring the only goal of their 1–0 win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Graham |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Stoke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25693671 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 May 2014 |date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2014, Puncheon made his loan spell into a permanent move, for a fee of around £1.75m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Puncheon pens permanent deal |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/january/puncheon-pens-permanent-deal/ |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puncheon's three goals in January and a further three in back-to-back wins in April that lifted Palace away from the relegation zone, led boss Tony Pulis to issue a 'hands off' warning to other clubs interesting in signing Puncheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Puncheon is not going anywhere warns Crystal Palace boss Pulis |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/jason-puncheon-is-not-going-anywhere-warns-crystal-palace-boss-pulis-9250768.html |newspaper=London Evening Standard |accessdate=14 April 2014 |date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tyler G. Brown''' (born February 7, 1990) is a Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] who is currently playing with the [[Reading Royals]] of the [[ECHL]].

==Playing career==
Undrafted, Brown played major junior hockey with the [[Plymouth Whalers]] in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] before he was signed as a free agent to a three-year, entry-level contract with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] on March 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = https://www.nhl.com/flyers/news/flyers-sign-two-to-entry-level-contracts/c-554840 | title = Flyers sign two to entry-level deals | publisher = ''[[Philadelphia Flyers]]'' | date = 2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2013-14 AHL season|2013–14]] season, the Flyers did not tender Brown a qualifying offer, leaving him as an unrestricted free agent.  On September 5, 2014, the [[Greenville Road Warriors]] announced they had signed him to an ECHL contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greenvilleroadwarriors.com/news-parkes-brown.html|title = Road Warriors Add Over 300 games of AHL Experience with Two Signings|date = September 5, 2014|accessdate = September 5, 2014|website = Greenville Road Warriors Official Website|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140906000146/http://www.greenvilleroadwarriors.com/news-parkes-brown.html|archivedate = September 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two seasons in the [[American Hockey League]] with the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]], Brown returned to Greenville as a free agent, signing a one-year deal with the [[Greenville Swamp Rabbits|Swamp Rabbits]] on September 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.echl.com/brown-returns-to-swamp-rabbits | title = Brown returns to Swamp Rabbits | publisher = ''[[ECHL]]'' | date = 2016-09-12 | accessdate = 2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2016-17 ECHL season|2016–17]] season, Brown opted to continue in the ECHL, returning within the Philadelphia Flyers affiliate's with the Reading Royals on September 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = https://royalshockey.com/royals-agree-to-terms-with-forward-tyler-brown/ | title = Royals agree to terms with forward Tyler Brown | publisher = ''[[Reading Royals]]'' | date = 2017-09-28 | accessdate = 2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
