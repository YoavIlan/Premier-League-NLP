{{nihongo|'''Maya Yoshida'''|吉田 麻也|Yoshida Maya|born 24 August 1988}} is a Japanese [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Southamp}} club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and the [[Japan national football team|Japan national team]]. Yoshida is also the captain of the Japanese national football team.

==Club career==
===Nagoya Grampus===
Born in [[Nagasaki]], Yoshida had been a defensive midfielder when playing for Grampus's youth team, but was converted to a centre back after promotion to its top team in 2007. In the 2008 season, he was in the starting lineup for most of the league matches with his Serbian teammate [[Miloš Bajalica]]. He scored [[Nagoya Grampus]]'s historical first goal in the [[AFC Champions League]] in the game against [[Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i]] on 10 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ulsan Hyundai vs. Nagoya Grampus - Football Match Summary |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/match?gameId=264652 |accessdate=23 December 2018 |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VVV-Venlo===
In December 2009, it was announced that Yoshida had transferred to Dutch club [[VVV-Venlo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsn.com/2009/12/28/football/news/asia/nagoyas-yoshida-to-join-venlo_26909/ Nagoya's Yoshida to join Venlo], wsn.com, 28 December 2009 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102014453/http://www.wsn.com/2009/12/28/football/news/asia/nagoyas-yoshida-to-join-venlo_26909/ |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had desired to play for a club in Europe since he was young. [[Keisuke Honda]] who was his teammate of [[Nagoya Grampus]] introduced his agent, [[Tetsuro Kiyooka]] to support his future vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/04/03/soccer/venlo-chief-eyes-new-japanese-talent/ Venlo chief eyes new Japanese talent], The Japan Times, 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Yoshida followed the footsteps of Keisuke Honda who also played for VVV-Venlo before he joined them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2009/12/29/1714116/japan-defender-maya-yoshida-leaves-nagoya-grampus-for-vvv |title=Japan Defender Maya Yoshida Leaves Nagoya Grampus For VVV Venlo |publisher=Goal.com |date=29 December 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a bicycle kick goal for VVV-Venlo off a corner kick on 11 September 2011 against [[PSV Eindhoven]]. The match ended in a 3–3 draw. This goal was awarded as "Goal of the Season 2011–2012" of the [[Eredivisie]]. In this season Maya Yoshida scored as a central defender 5 goals in total.

===Southampton===
On 30 August 2012, he agreed to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on a three-year contract for a fee thought to be in the region of £3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan's Yoshida Set For Saints|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/japans-yoshida-set-for-saints-343281.aspx |publisher=Southampton FC|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19426865 |title=Southampton sign Maya Yoshida, Japan's Olympic captain|date=30 August 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the Saints on 15 September 2012, against Arsenal in a 6–1 defeat, coming on as a 28th-minute substitute for [[Jos Hooiveld]]. He then made his home debut a week later on 22 September 2012 in a 4–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], playing the whole 90 minutes.

On 9 August 2013, it was announced that Yoshida would be on the front cover of the Japanese Edition of [[FIFA 14]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/saints-agree-partnership-with-ea-sports-979983.aspx|title=Saints agree partnership with EA SPORTS |publisher=Southampton FC |date= |accessdate=9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first goal for Southampton in a 2–1 defeat to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 6 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24739094|title=Sunderland 2 – 1 Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first Premier League goal in a 3–1 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 22 February 2014 after a [[Steven Davis]] free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan|first=Nabil|title=West Ham 3 – 1 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26202718 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next goal came on 20 December 2014, in a 3–0 victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], with Steven Davis again providing the assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cryer|first1=Andy|title=Southampton 3 – 0 Everton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30459790|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 December 2014|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 Southampton announced that Yoshida and the club had agreed terms to an extension of his contract until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucas|first1=Jim|title=Yoshida extends Saints deal until 2018|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20150102-maya-yoshida-contract-2177890.aspx|website=Southampton FC|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Cork City===
Long was discovered and brought to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] with a [[scholarship]] on 1 July 2004 by [[Pat Dolan]]. He was called to the first team squad for the 2005 season when manager Dolan was replaced by [[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]], and the new manager awarded him his senior [[League of Ireland]] debut on 25 March 2005 as a substitute for [[Joe Gamble]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2005/0326/Pg029.html#Ar02901:3E665B41466941865B42D66946273446E73E Irish Times] {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only other appearance was again as a substitute in the [[Setanta Sports Cup]] on 2 May.&lt;ref name="SSC"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2005/0503/Pg019.html#Ar01905:0005F105A60900068404169204168404469204468404A69201974105A74F0C874E10975C18F6131B961D1A66401CE64A1BE64B1E76551EE6BA22F6C819D74F1D27590006351FA63F1FC63520163F Irish Times] {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following Dolan's consultation with his brother, [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] coach [[Eamonn Dolan]], Reading made bids for both Long and [[Kevin Doyle]]. Cork were forced to sell Doyle due to a contract clause, but the circumstances surrounding Long's transfer were not disclosed. Long signed as a Reading player on 7 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tipperarystar.ie/news/local/shane-long-celebrates-his-21st-birthday-1-2261233 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412232301/http://www.tipperarystar.ie/news/local/shane-long-celebrates-his-21st-birthday-1-2261233 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2013 |title=Shane Long Celebrates his 21st Birthday – Tipperary Star |publisher=Tipperarystar.ie |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2007, Long signed an improved four-year contract to keep him at Reading until the end of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 July 2007 |url=http://www.readingfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~1067116,00.html |title=Four new contracts agreed |publisher=Reading FC |accessdate=7 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411130459/http://www.readingfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10306~1067116%2C00.html |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2008, in a 2–1 defeat at [[Anfield]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Long was involved in an incident as to where he flung his shirt to the ground, citing frustration at his performance and frustration with the match official [[Andre Marriner]], after being subbed by manager [[Steve Coppell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Shane Long offers apology for shirt-throwing tantrum | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3564543.ece | work=The Times | accessdate=8 September 2011 | date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-match interview, Steve Coppell made a stern point in that "it will not happen again".

His 2008–09 season ended happily after scoring an equaliser in a 1–1 draw at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], before ending the season with a brace in a 2–0 victory at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 December 2008 |title=Match Report |url=http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10306~43633,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231015107/http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10306~43633%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 December 2008 |publisher=Reading FC |accessdate=8 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, he made his first appearance for the club, replacing fellow debutant [[Dušan Tadić]] for the final 16 minutes of a 2–1 defeat at Liverpool in Southampton's opening game of the league season. He almost scored a late equaliser when he nodded a header just wide of the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool 2 − 1 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28730043|accessdate=17 August 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long scored his first Southampton goal against Stoke City in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 29 October, putting his team 2–0 up in a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2 − 3 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29718448|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2014|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2015, Long assisted teammate Sadio Mané twice inside three minutes as the latter scored the fastest ever hat-trick in the history of the Premier League during the first half of a 6–1 demolition of Aston Villa. Later on in the first half, Long himself scored twice to give the Saints a 5–0 lead five minutes from half-time. The second of these efforts was a 35-yard lob which was named as Southampton's Goal of the Season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20150521-shane-long-post-player-awards-night-2465036.aspx |title=SOUTHAMPTON FC &amp;#124; Shane Long says he didn't expect to win the Vision Accendo Goal of the Season |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel William John Ings''' (born 23 July 1992) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from fellow {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Ings started his career in the youth team of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined [[AFC Bournemouth]], progressing through their youth system, while also spending time at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] on loan. In 2011 Ings joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] with whom he won the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 Championship]] Player of the Year, and helped them achieve promotion to the Premier League. Following Burnley's relegation, and the expiry of his contract with the club, Ings moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2015, but his first season at [[Anfield]] was ended after two months due to injury. His second season with Liverpool was also mired by injury, with Ings only making two League Cup appearances throughout the 2016–17 season. Ings joined Southampton on loan in August 2018, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.

Formerly an [[England national under-21 football team|under-21 international]], Ings made his senior debut for England in October 2015.

==Club career==
===AFC Bournemouth===
Ings was born in [[Winchester]], Hampshire and grew up in [[Netley]], Hampshire.&lt;ref name="Burnley FC Player Profiles: Danny Ings" /&gt; As a child he attended Netley Abbey Primary School and [[Hamble School|Hamble Community Sports College]]. Ings dreamed of playing for local club Southampton, but was rejected for being too small.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] from Netley Central Sports, before being released as a school boy.&lt;ref name="Cherries offers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9141445.Cherries__Boss_Lee_offers_Ings_brand_new_contract/ |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |first=Neil |last=Perrett |title=Cherries: Boss Lee offers Ings brand new contract |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, Ings played for [[Southampton|Itchen Tyro]]. He subsequently signed a two-year apprentice contract with [[AFC Bournemouth]] in May 2008, having progressed through the club's Centre of Excellence while he was still at secondary school at Hamble Community Sports College.&lt;ref name="New intake for coach Joe"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/2268488.new_intake_for_coach_joe/ |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |first=Ian |last=Wadley |title=New intake for coach Joe |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also previously had experience playing for the reserve team.&lt;ref name="New intake for coach Joe"/&gt; He made his professional debut for Bournemouth on 6 October 2009, in a 2–1 away defeat to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]], replacing [[Jason Tindall]] in the second half as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8284875.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Northampton 2–1 Bournemouth |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second season in the youth team was blighted by a long-term abdominal injury, which restricted his playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8828804.Cherries__Hot_shot_Ings_can_only_get_better/ |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |first=Ian |last=Wadley |title=Cherries: Hot-shot Ings can only get better |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with the youth team until the summer of 2010, when he signed a short-term three-month contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8711429.Cherries__Howe_has_high_hopes_for_star_Ings/?action=complain&amp;cid=8964719 |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |first=Ian |last=Wadley |title=Cherries: Howe has high hopes for star Ings |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his contract in September 2010, until the end of the 2010–11 campaign.&lt;ref name="Cherries offers"/&gt;

On 25 October 2016, Ings sustained damage to his right knee in a League Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur that would require another spell on the sidelines of up to 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37845825 |title=Danny Ings: Liverpool striker to miss rest of the season because of injury |date=2 November 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully underwent surgery to repair the damage to his knee and began rehabilitation at [[Melwood]] on 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/242599-danny-ings-returns-to-melwood-to-begin-rehab |title=Danny Ings returns to Melwood to begin rehab |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |last=Shaw |first=Chris |date=9 November 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2017, Ings made his first appearance in 11 months since the injury when he came on as a second-half substitute in the 2–0 defeat to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[2017–18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/19/leicester-city-liverpool-carabao-cup-match-report |title=Islam Slimani strike seals Leicester win as Liverpool crash out of Carabao Cup |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 September 2017 |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2018, he scored his first goal after his return from injury in a 2–2 draw with West Brom.

===Southampton===
[[File:Danny Ings 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|Ings playing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2018]]

After struggling playing time in the 2017–18 season due to the form of attackers [[Roberto Firmino]], [[Mohamed Salah]], and [[Sadio Mané]], Ings requested a move away from Liverpool in the summer of 2018. Ings was a popular figure in the dressing room and Jurgen Klopp was reluctant to let him leave in spite of his limited appearances in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/danny-ings-interview-at-liverpool-i-would-go-home-sit-with-my-dogs-and-feel-upset-i-moved-to-southampton-to-be-happy-tc2d89g8p |title=Danny Ings interview: At Liverpool I would go home, sit with my dogs and feel upset.

==Club career==

===Non-league===
Born in [[Hungerford]], [[Berkshire]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Austin trained with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]'s youth teams as a youngster but was released for being too small when he was 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/from-brickie-to-big-league-charlie-austin-on-his-journey-from-building-sites-to-qpr-9089272.html|title=From brickie to big league?

Moving with his family to [[Bournemouth]], he then switched to nearby semi-professional [[Wessex League]] Premier Division team [[Poole Town F.C.|Poole Town]] while also working as a [[bricklayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/07/charlie-austin-swindon-town-bricklayer|title=Charlie Austin pinches himself on road from bricklayer to football hero|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 March 2010|accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London | first=Stuart | last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season of 2008–09, Austin scored 46 goals in 46 appearances for Poole in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poole Town Player Statistics 2008/09 |url=http://www.poole-townfc.co.uk/Player%20Stats/player_stats_0809.html |publisher=Poole Town F.C. |year=2009 |accessdate=19 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208020326/http://www.poole-townfc.co.uk/Player%20Stats/player_stats_0809.html |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin spent the pre-season of the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]] on [[Trial (association football)|trial]] with [[Football League Two|League Two]] club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Although Bournemouth's manager, [[Eddie Howe]], was keen to sign the striker on a permanent deal, Bournemouth were unable to make a move for the striker due to a transfer embargo imposed on the club by the [[The Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/football/4649747.Austin_s_Robins_move_is_on_the_cards/|title = Austin's Robins move is on the cards|newspaper= [[Bournemouth Daily Echo]]|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin continued to play for Poole Town, scoring 18 goals in 11 games at the beginning of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poole-townfc.co.uk/Player%20Stats/player_stats_0910.html|title=Poole Town Player Statistics 2009/10|publisher=Poole Town F.C.|year=2010|accessdate=13 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208020137/http://www.poole-townfc.co.uk/Player%20Stats/player_stats_0910.html|archivedate=8 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2012, Austin scored two goals in a 3–4 win over [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], and subsequently equalled [[Ray Pointer]]'s club record of scoring in eight consecutive appearances, which was achieved back during the [[1958–59 in English football|1958–59 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20066554|title=Charlie Austin equals Burnley goalscoring record at Bristol City|work=BBC Sport|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/austin-on-matching-rays-record-241012-444887.aspx?pageView=full#anchored|title=Austin's Pride at Matching Ray Pointer|work=Burnley Football Club|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also became only the second-ever Burnley player to score 20 goals before the end of November after [[Andy Lochhead]], who reached 20 goals in 25 games on 26 November 1966.&lt;ref name="NewRecord"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/charlie-sets-new-record-061112-470376.aspx|title=Charlie Sets New Record|work=Burnley Football Club|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20237543|title=Burnley striker Charlie Austin reaches 20-goal landmark|work=BBC Sport|date=7 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Ulldecona]], [[Province of Tarragona|Tarragona]], [[Catalonia]], Romeu started his career at local CF Ulldecona. He arrived in [[FC Barcelona]]'s youth academy in 2004, from neighbours [[RCD Espanyol]], and progressed through the club's [[La Masia|youth academy]] until breaking into the [[FC Barcelona B|reserve team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oriolromeu.info Oriol Romeu Official Site]; Oriol Romeu, 13 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Pep Guardiola]] handed him his first appearance for the senior side in a friendly against [[Kuwait]]i team [[Kazma Sporting Club]], and subsequently included him in the squad for the [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup]] which took place in [[Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/222/transfer-zone/2010/01/04/1724075/stoke-city-plot-shock-swoop-for-barcelona-starlet-oriol Stoke City plot shock swoop for Barcelona starlet Oriol Romeu]; Goal.com, 4 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Romeu was included in the nineteen-man Barcelona squad on 13 August 2010, due to the need to rest some of Barça's Spanish internationals. He was to face [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the first leg of [[2010 Supercopa de España|the season]]'s [[Supercopa de España|Spanish Supercup]]. He made his official competitive debut in that game, playing the full ninety minutes in the 1–3 away loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/futbol/temporada10-11/08/13/n100813112411.html|title=Nine B team players in squad for Seville|publisher=Barcelona's official website|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=15 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69a2dWO6Z?url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/futbol/temporada10-11/08/13/n100813112411.html|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/castellano/noticies/futbol/temporada10-11/08/14/n100815112422.html|title=Debutan Miño, Sergi Gómez, Romeu y Adriano|trans-title=Debut for Miño, Sergi Gómez, Romeu and Adriano|publisher=Barcelona's official website|language=Spanish|date=14 August 2010|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romeu made his official debut for Chelsea on 10 September 2011, being brought on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the 79th minute of the 2–1 away win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/14773097.stm|title=Sunderland 1–2 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first start on the 21st, in a 0–0 draw ([[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] win) against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for [[2011–12 Football League Cup|the season]]'s [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/14910268.stm|title=Chelsea 0–0 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romeu's first [[UEFA Champions League]] appearance came on 19 October 2011, playing the full 90 minutes in a 5–0 [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|group stage]] home win against [[K.R.C. Genk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/matchday-live/match/61066|title=Chelsea 5 v 0 Genk|publisher=Chelsea's official website|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first start in the [[Premier League]] was against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 26 November, putting in a solid performance in a 3–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/uk/en/report/318077/report.html|title=Blues cruise past Wolves to ease pressure on AVB|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=26 November 2011|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Chelsea issued a statement regarding the deal surrounding Romeu's buy back clause with Barcelona. The statement highlighted that the ''Blaugrana'' did not have an automatic buy back clause as first suggested, only having first refusal on any deal if the Blues wanted to sell him in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2544256|title=Villas-Boas: Our Oriol|publisher=Chelsea's official website|date=11 December 2011|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario René Junior Lemina''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁjo ləmina}}; born 1 September 1993) is a Gabonese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] for English club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]  and the [[Gabon national football team|Gabon national team]]. He played for French sides [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] and [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], before joining Italian side [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2015, where he won the [[Double (association football)#Italy|domestic double]] in both of his seasons with the club.

==Club career==
===Early career with Lorient===
Lemina began his career in France with the [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] youth academy at the age of 11; he was later promoted to the first team during the [[2012–13 Ligue 1|2012–13 season]], his only season with the club.&lt;ref name="Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/mario-lemina-juves-hot-headed-loanee-who-liverpool-wanted-summer#:oC24SNXstL9f9A|title=Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer|publisher=Four Four Two|author1=Greg Lea|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marseille===
The following season, [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] acquired Lemina for €4 million, although he initially struggled to gain playing time in his first year with the club, making only eight league starts during the [[2013–14 Ligue 1|2013–14 season]]. He began to be used more frequently by manager [[Marcelo Bielsa]] during the [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15 season]], making his breakthrough with the club, as he helped the team to a fourth-place finish, earning 23 appearances in the league.&lt;ref name="Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer"/&gt; In February 2015, Lemina was sent off for a punch to the groin of [[Ola Toivonen]] in a 1–1 [[Ligue 1]] away draw against [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/lemina-could-face-action-after-groin-punch|title=Lemina could face action after groin punch|publisher=Four Four Two|date=7 February 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juventus===
During the summer of 2015, Lemina began to attract the attention of several clubs, including [[Premier League]] clubs [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer"/&gt; On 31 August, however, the last day of the transfer window, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] announced the signing of Lemina on a season-long loan for €500,000 with an option to buy for €9.5 million at the end of the [[2015–16 Serie A|2015–16 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2015/08/31/14909702/juventus-confirm-lemina-medical?ICID=HP_BN_4|title=Juventus confirm Lemina medical|publisher=Goal.com|author=Alec Fenn|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2015, he scored his first goal for Juventus in his third appearance, coming in the 63rd minute of a 2–1 away loss to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Napoli/26-09-2015/napoli-juventus-2-1-insigne-higuain-inguaiano-allegri-lemina-gol-inutile-130279942508.shtml|title=Napoli-Juventus 2-1: Insigne e Higuain inguaiano Allegri.

Lemina, futile goal|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|author=Gianluca Monti|language=Italian|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2016, Lemina's loan was made permanent; he signed a four-year deal from Marseille for a fee of €9.5 million plus an extra €1 million if performance related targets are met. The deal was scheduled to keep him at Juventus until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2016/-lemina-signs-four-year-juventus-deal-.php|title=Lemina signs four-year Juventus deal|publisher=juventus.com|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May, Lemina started in the [[2016 Coppa Italia Final|Coppa Italia Final]], playing the full match as Juventus defeated [[A.C.

A strong, hard-working, and dynamic right-footed [[midfielder]], with good technique and solid distribution, Lemina is a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box]] player who is usually deployed in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]], due to his ability to start attacking plays after winning back possession. Due to his tactical versatility, he is capable of playing in several positions, and has been deployed as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]], or as a [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], on the right flank; during his time with Marseille, he also played as [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] in a three-man defence on occasion, during the 2014–15 season, under manager [[Marcelo Bielsa]].&lt;ref name="Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.ilmattino.it/sscnapoli/news/lemina_vuole_napoli_intermediario/1536663.shtml|title=Luigi Romano, intermediario per Lemina, promette: "Centrocampista di classe e grinta, vuole l’azzurro"|trans-title=Lugii Romano, an intermediary for Lemina, promises: "A classy and tenacious midfielder, he wants the azzurri shirt"|publisher=Il Mattino|author=Pasquale Guardascione|language=italian|date = 28 August 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2015/08/29-3557170/napoli_soriano-lemina_le_scelte_a_centrocampo/?cookieAccept|title=Napoli, Soriano-Lemina: le scelte a centrocampo|trans-title=Napoli, Soriano-Lemina: the choices in midfield|publisher=Il Corriere dello Sport|author=Antonio Giordano|date=29 August 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2015/08/28-3534546/assalto_napoli_lemina_o_vecino_a_centrocampo/?cookieAccept|title=Assalto Napoli: Lemina o Vecino a centrocampo|trans-title=Napoli assalt: Lemina or Vecino in midfield|publisher=Il Corriere dello Sport|author=Antonio Giordano|language=Italian|date=28 August 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his talent, he has also earned a reputation for having a temper and for lacking concentration at times.&lt;ref name="Mario Lemina: Juve’s hot-headed loanee who Liverpool wanted this summer"/&gt;

On 19 May 2012, Bertrand became the first player to make his Champions League debut in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|final]], starting in an unfamiliar left wing role in front of Cole; Chelsea beat [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 4–3 on penalties.

On 2 July 2012, Bertrand was named in Stuart Pearce's [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's team squads#Great Britain|18-man squad]] for the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pearce names squad |url=http://www1.skysports.com/olympics/story/15234/7859286 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first match for [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] on 20 July 2012 in a friendly match against [[Brazil Olympic football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great Britain 0–2 Brazil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18929315 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played three matches during the Olympic tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/be/ryan-bertrand-1.html |title=Ryan Bertrand Bio, Stats, and Results |website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com |language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior team===
On 10 August 2012, Bertrand was called up to the senior [[England national football team|England]] team for the first time, for a friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/lescott-called-injured-oxlade-chamberlain-110000966--sow.html |title=Lescott called up as injured Oxlade-Chamberlain drops out of England squad for Italy friendly |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his international debut coming on for [[Leighton Baines]] in the 78th minute and cleared a shot off the line minutes later from [[Manolo Gabbiadini]] which eventually led to England's winning goal as England won the match 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2188915/England-2-Italy-1--match-report.html |title=England 2 Italy 1: Defoe thunderbolt earns Hodgson's men morale-boosting win |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=15 August 2012 |first=Matt |last=Lawton}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 September 2012, Bertrand came on after 73 minutes in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and crossed the ball that led to the [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that [[Frank Lampard]] converted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England 1–1 Ukraine |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19527517 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 July 2014 |date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October 2012, Bertrand was called up to the England squad for two more qualifying matches, against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England call-ups for Jonjo Shelvey and Ryan Bertrand |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19860360 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he missed both matches because of a virus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/early-england-goal-against-san-marino-the-key-says-wayne-rooney-8208649.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertrand came on as a substitute for England away to Italy on 3 March 2015 and he won his fourth full cap, starting for England against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] on 7 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rain washes out England's qualifying match with Poland |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19941036 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 July 2014 |date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/16/steven-gerrard-hits-back-at-patrick-vieira-stars-do-love-playing-for-england-601595/ |title=Steven Gerrard hits back at Vieira: Stars do love playing for England |newspaper=Metro |location=London |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bertrand was part of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 squads#England|squad]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2016/may/england-final-uefa-euro-2016-squad-announcement |title=Roy Hodgson confirms final squad for UEFA EURO 2016 |publisher=The Football Association |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2017, Bertrand scored his first goal for England in a 4–0 [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] win over [[Malta national football team|Malta]].&lt;ref name=Malta/&gt;

==Style of play==
Bertrand has been described as a modern-day full-back who gives assistance in attacking down the flanks, keeping and retaining possession as well as defending and reclaiming possession, making quick runs into the box and often does one-two's with his teammates.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Bertrand was described by [[Glenn Roeder]], his manager at Norwich, as a defender who "likes to bomb forward and is tenacious in the tackle when defending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/3777545/ |title=Bertrand back with Canaries |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 ''[[ESPN FC]]'' article about the state of left-backs in England, Michael Cox said that the "only real star is Ryan Bertrand, a truly excellent full-back defensively and offensively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For several top Premier League clubs, left-back is a liability |date=20 February 2018 |first=Michael |last=Cox |accessdate=23 February 2018 |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/3390575/for-several-top-premier-league-clubs-left-back-is-a-liability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early life and career====
Redmond was born in [[Birmingham]], West Midlands,&lt;ref name=Hugman/&gt; of Irish and Jamaican descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport-magazine.co.uk/features/nathan-redmond |title=Nathan Redmond |first=Graham |last=Willgoss |magazine=Sport Magazine |issue=414 |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817000601/http://www.sport-magazine.co.uk/features/nathan-redmond |archivedate=17 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the [[Kitts Green]] district,&lt;ref name=ProDeal/&gt; attending the Oval Primary School in [[Yardley, Birmingham|Yardley]] and then [[Sheldon Heath Community Arts College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-nathan-redmond---131503 |title=Birmingham City's Nathan Redmond&amp;nbsp;– his first feature interview |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the player's ''Facebook'' page, he was first noticed by [[Birmingham City F.C. Reserves and Academy#Academy|Birmingham City's Academy]] [[scout (sport)|scouts]] as an eight-year-old while playing alongside older boys, and scored a [[hat-trick]] in his first match for the club's under-10 team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nathan-Redmond/114638531902985 |title=Wall |last=Redmond |first=Nathan |publisher=Facebook |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored three goals as Birmingham's under-15 team reached the semi-final of the Nike Premier Cup for the first time in April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/AcademyDetail/0,,10412~1621602,00.html |title=Kids shine in Premier Cup |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=April 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416074653/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/AcademyDetail/0,,10412~1621602,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same season played in the club's under-18 academy team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blues News |editor=Lewis, Peter |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |first=Terry |last=Westley |chapter=Academy End of Season Review |page=64 |date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2009–10 Birmingham City F.C. season|2009–10 season]], while still a schoolboy, Redmond made 15&amp;nbsp;appearances, scoring 3&amp;nbsp;times, for the academy under-18s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blues News |editor=Lewis, Peter |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |chapter=Academy |page=62 |date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a few [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] appearances for the [[Birmingham City F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]], including a "lively late performance" against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/Match/ReservesReport/0,,10412~1990190,00.html |title=Villa Res 4 Blues Res 0 |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902120457/http://www.bcfc.com/page/Match/ReservesReport/0,,10412~1990190,00.html |archivedate=2 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redmond was given a first-team [[Squad number (association football)|squad number]] and named on standby for the [[Premier League]] match at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] a couple of days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~1992479,00.html |title=Squad Number For Schoolboy Redmond |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416093835/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~1992479,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not make the 18-man squad. He was an unused substitute for Birmingham's final home match of the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10 season]], aged 16 years and 56 days. Had he taken the field, he would have become the club's youngest first-team player and also the youngest ever Premier League player, at nine days younger than the record set by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s [[Matthew Briggs]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Bids&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-fend-off-bids-for-youngsters-126554 |title=Birmingham City fend off bids for youngsters |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/matthew-briggs-grabs-chance-to-make-his-name-for-fulham-6507267.html |title=Matthew Briggs grabs chance to make his name for Fulham |first=Ian |last=Gibb |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy manager [[Terry Westley]] described him in June 2010 as "one of those wingers like an [[Aaron Lennon]] or [[Ashley Young]]. He has got pace and can run the ball past defenders and has the creativity to go with it", and confirmed that other clubs had shown an interest in him.&lt;ref name=Bids/&gt; He signed a scholarship contract with Birmingham City in July 2010.&lt;ref name=scholar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/RulesandRegulations/~/media/Files/PDF/TheFA/Rules_Regs/July%202010.ashx/July%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=List of Players Registered as Scholars in Accordance with Rule C.3 Between 01/07/2010 and 31/07/2010 |publisher=The Football Association |page=43 |date=August 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911082322/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/RulesandRegulations/~/media/Files/PDF/TheFA/Rules_Regs/July%202010.ashx/July%202010.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redmond made his first-team debut for Birmingham in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] second-round tie against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] on 26 August 2010, replacing Spanish midfielder [[Enric Vallès]] in the 78th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10412~54523,00.html |title=Birmingham 3 Rochdale 2 |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225837/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10412~54523,00.html |archivedate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 16&amp;nbsp;years and 173&amp;nbsp;days{{snd}}34 days older than [[Trevor Francis]] was on his debut{{snd}}he became the club's second-youngest player ever. Manager [[Alex McLeish]] was highly complimentary about his brief appearance:{{quote|He set it alight. I know we never had a full house, but the fans that were there warmed to him. His performance was very bright, quick, he got a couple of shots away. And it excited me. It was a really bright spark for us. Has he got a big future? It looks like it. He's electric. He's a right winger but he showed his versatility coming in off the left and going in and hitting shots. He was a handful for Rochdale. It was good to see somebody with a little bit of pace going by defenders.&lt;ref name=2ndyoungest&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-mcleish-heaps-praise-130830 |title=Birmingham City: McLeish heaps praise on Blues' second-youngest ever player |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To gain first-team experience, Redmond joined [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] in January 2011 on a month's Football League youth loan, an arrangement which allows the player to appear in junior matches for Birmingham when not required by the loaning club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2272010,00.html |title=Redmond joins Brewers on loan |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416074656/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2272010,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the move was cancelled a few days later when the Football League, who had initially ratified the deal, realised that the rules forbade a first-year scholar from signing on loan for a League club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burton_albion/9382909.stm |title=Burton Albion's loan deal for Nathan Redmond collapses |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made two more substitute appearances for Birmingham that season, one in the League Cup and one in the [[FA Cup]],&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt; and signed a three-year professional contract as soon as he turned 17, in March 2011.&lt;ref name=ProDeal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2311099,00.html |title=Redmond agrees pro deal |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416071644/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2311099,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
[[File:Nathan Redmond.png|thumb|upright|The 17-year-old Redmond pictured in 2011 pre-season]]

On his return from the [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup|U-17 World Cup]], Redmond started Birmingham's first pre-season friendly match, a 1–0 defeat of [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]]. New manager [[Chris Hughton]] suggested he had done well, given his youth: "In particular I thought Nathan Redmond did very well. We have to remember he's only 17 years of age. He showed some good touches although the final bit let him down a little."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2394565,00.html |title=Hughton happy with winning start |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=16 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820133913/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2394565,00.html |archivedate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of fellow midfielders [[Keith Fahey]], [[Morgaro Gomis]] and [[Jordon Mutch]], Redmond played the whole of the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League#Play-off round|Europa League play-off round]] first leg against Portuguese club [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]], the first time he had completed 90 minutes in a senior match and the first time his club had participated in major European competition for nearly 50 years. His driven shot from outside the penalty area was pushed aside by goalkeeper [[Elisson]] and led to [[Chris Wood (footballer, born 1991)|Chris Wood]] heading against the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2425048,00.html |title=Spector handed debut |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416085218/http://www.bcfc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2425048,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/18/birmingham-nacional-europa-league-qualifier |title=Birmingham settle for goalless draw after woodwork denies them thrice |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |agency=Press Association |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his League debut three days later, again playing the whole match, in a 3–1 defeat at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14520299 |title=Middlesbrough 3–1 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second leg against Nacional, Redmond opened the scoring with a low drive from {{convert|20|yd}}, which was in contention for the club's goal of the season,&lt;ref name=awards/&gt; and later hit the post with a curled shot in a man-of-the-match performance as Birmingham won 3–0 to progress to the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/25/birmingham-city-qualify-europa-league |title=Nathan Redmond leads rampant Birmingham City to win over Nacional |first=Stuart |last=James |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/248531/report |title=Blues cruise through in Europa |publisher=Sky Sports |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redmond's first league goal came in a 3–0 win at home to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 31 December 2011 as he "smashed an unstoppable shot from just outside the penalty area that beat [[Mark Howard (footballer, born September 1986)|Howard]] at his near post".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/blues-see-out-eventful-year-229766 |title=Blues see out eventful year in style |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Sunday Mercury |location=Birmingham |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second, "thumped in&amp;nbsp;... from 12 yards in stoppage time" completed a 6–0 win away against a nine-man [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16453308 |title=Millwall 0–6 Birmingham City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redmond opened the scoring with a shot from the edge of the penalty area as Birmingham went on to beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 4–0 to progress to the fifth round of the [[2011–12 FA Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/16664303.stm |title=Sheffield Utd 0–4 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came off the bench to score a "stunning" 86th-minute swivelled volley to give Birmingham a 1–0 win against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] that took them to third place in the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16805557 |title=Birmingham 1–0 Portsmouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with seven goals from 37 appearances in all competitions, and won the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-chris-burke-cleans-184270 |title=Chris Burke cleans up at annual awards dinner at the ICC in Birmingham |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Ahead of the new season, the club's acting chairman insisted that, despite financial problems, neither Redmond nor goalkeeper [[Jack Butland]] were for sale "unless we are subject to an eye-popping offer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-jack-butland-and-nathan-187537 |title=Birmingham City: Jack Butland and Nathan Redmond are going nowhere&amp;nbsp;– Peter Pannu |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redmond aimed to establish himself as a first-team regular.&lt;ref name=2012regular&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-nathan-redmond-vows-380139 |title=Nathan Redmond vows to make red hot comeback for Birmingham City |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his 50th senior appearance in the 1–0 win at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] in October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-nathan-redmond-celebrates-5390 |title=Birmingham City: Nathan Redmond celebrates 50 up for Blues |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon afterwards, Birmingham signed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] winger [[Robert Hall (footballer)|Robert Hall]] on loan, and Redmond was sometimes left out of the squad. According to new manager [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], Redmond "needed to be taken out of the firing line and would be better for it"; he made comparisons with loanee [[Ravel Morrison]], who had been encouraged to understand the importance of "the whole package, getting it right&amp;nbsp;– the training, the preparation, the matches, getting that all put in place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lee-clark-on-why-he-left-nathan-redmond-345518 |title=Lee Clark: 'There's no bigger fan of Nathan Redmond than me.' |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After talking to his manager, Redmond accepted the need to improve his performance in training.&lt;ref name=2012regular/&gt;

Against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in December, in what was reportedly the youngest starting eleven ever fielded by the club, Redmond played as a second striker off [[Nikola Žigić]], a position that exploited his pace and preference for receiving the ball to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lee-clark-salutes-spirit-of-his-teenage-383013 |title=Lee Clark salutes spirit of his teenage players |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the season went on, Redmond's form improved: he created a goal for [[Chris Burke (footballer)|Chris Burke]] against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-lee-clark-praises-1297510 |title=Lee Clark: 'The goals will come for young Nathan Redmond.' |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when his first goal of the season finally arrived, against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in March, Clark suggested it boded well for his future as a goalscorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pictures-birmingham-city---nathan-1738107 |title=Lee Clark&amp;nbsp;– 'Nathan's technically very good, he's lightning quick and defenders hate that.' |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player spoke of himself as a "confidence player", who needed to accept the need for patience and not to let frustration get the better of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/picture-gallery-special-nathan-redmond-1741224 |title=Nathan Redmond&amp;nbsp;– 'All I want to do is play football for Birmingham City.' |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nathan-redmond-talks-colin-tattum-2995268 |title=Nathan Redmond: "Recently I've been playing quite well and the only thing I can do is keep asking that of myself." |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=23 April 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Birmingham Mail'''s end-of-season assessment, "Redmond's form over the last three months was as good as it ever has been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-end-of-season-report-colin-4000289 |title=End-of-season report: Slow start&amp;nbsp;– but it's a solid finish for Clark |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That form earned him selection for the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20]] squad for the [[FIFA Under-20 World Cup|Under-20 World Cup]],&lt;ref name=Taylorsquad/&gt; then as a late addition to the squad for the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2013 European Under-21 Championship]] finals.&lt;ref name=UEFAU21/&gt;

===Norwich City===
[[File:Natham Redmond, Norwich City (15390016528) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Redmond playing for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2014]]

Together with many of his under-17 teammates, Redmond moved up to the [[England national under-18 football team|England under-18s]], a non-competitive age group at international level, in 2011.

He has represented England at [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He began his career at his hometown club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before joining [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2011, eventually signing his first professional contract in 2013.

After spending the [[2017–18 in English football|2017–18 season]] on loan at boyhood club Norwich, enjoying a good run of performances throughout the entire [[EFL Championship|Championship]] campaign, Gunn signed for Southampton in the summer of 2018, for a transfer fee of £13.5 million.

==Early life==
Gunn was born in [[Norwich]], Norfolk,&lt;ref name=11v11/&gt; to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s former goalkeeper and manager [[Bryan Gunn|Bryan]] and

At the end of the season, Norwich fans voted him third in the Player of the Season vote behind [[James Maddison]] and [[Grant Hanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.canaries.co.uk/News/2018/april/maddison-pots/ |title=James Maddison voted Player of the Season|publisher=canaries.co.uk |date=28 April 2018 |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fraser Gerard Forster''' (born 17 March 1988) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Forster started his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and had brief [[Loan (sports)|loan]] spells with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] and [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. He then spent a successful season on loan at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], helping the club win the [[EFL League One|League One]] title and promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. Forster then joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on loan for the [[2010–11 Celtic F.C. season|2010–11]] season, and helped them win the [[Scottish Cup]]. He spent a further season on loan there, winning the [[Scottish Premier League]] before becoming a permanent squad member in 2012 for a transfer fee of £2.2&amp;nbsp;million. Forster won many plaudits for his performances at Celtic and holds the Scottish top division record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal. In August 2014, he joined Southampton for a reported £10&amp;nbsp;million. Forster had a generally impressive debut season in the Premier League, but sustained a serious knee injury in March 2015 which ruled him out for the rest of the year. On his return in January 2016, he quickly found form again and went on to set a club record of 708 minutes without conceding a goal. Forster's return aided Southampton's rise from thirteenth in the league to a sixth-place finish, earning them qualification for the following season's [[UEFA Europa League]].

Forster was selected for several England squads during 2012 and 2013 before finally making his first international appearance in November 2013. He was named in England's squads for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
Forster was born in [[Hexham]], Northumberland, the son of Brian Clive Forster [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (who later became a [[Circuit judge (England and Wales)|circuit judge]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Louise|title=Fraser Forster's Celtic adventure leads to England World Cup call|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/04/fraser-forster-celtic-england-world-cup|accessdate=27 September 2016|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]],&lt;ref name=SignsCeltic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20120705/forster-signs-for-celtic_2281670_2829530 |title=Forster Signs For Celtic |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815060321/http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20120705/forster-signs-for-celtic_2281670_2829530 |archivedate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not begin playing as a goalkeeper until he was 13 years old.&lt;ref name = "england call"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/04/fraser-forster-celtic-england-world-cup |title=Fraser Forster's Celtic adventure leads to England World Cup call |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Louise |last=Taylor |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then he had mainly played either [[rugby union]] or [[cricket]].&lt;ref name = "england call"/&gt; Coaches initially thought Forster might be too small to play as a goalkeeper,&lt;ref name="england call"/&gt; although he played for local junior team Stocksfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraser pays £100k dues to Stocksfield|url=http://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/Fraser-pays-100k-dues-to-Stocksfield--fb1e98e4-c354-4e7c-9f20-68ee19a3b2a6-ds|accessdate=30 November 2015|newspaper=Hexham Courant|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before joining the renowned [[Wallsend Boys Club]].&lt;ref name = "england call"/&gt; However, he entered a significant growth spurt at 15 years of age and later signed with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref name = "england call"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Newcastle United===
[[File:Fraser Forster.jpg|thumb|upright|Forster playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2008]]

Forster earned his first professional contract with Newcastle United, signing for their Academy in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/24507 |title=Transfer Talk: Newcastle United Sell Fraser Forster To Glasgow Celtic |publisher=Sky Tyne &amp; Wear |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate= 5 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711071647/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/24507 |archivedate=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the [[Newcastle United F.C. season 2007-08|2007–08 season]] while [[Tim Krul]] was on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/sundaysun/tm_headline=burnley-keen-on-newcastle-keeper-fraser-forster%26method=full%26objectid=26707512%26siteid=61634-name_page.html |title=Burnley keen on Newcastle keeper Fraser Forster |newspaper=Evening Chronicle |location=Newcastle |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502020242/http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/sundaysun/tm_headline%3Dburnley-keen-on-newcastle-keeper-fraser-forster%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D26707512%26siteid%3D61634-name_page.html |archivedate= 2 May 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played regularly in the reserves.&lt;ref name="2m-move"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/newcastle-united/nufc-news/2012/06/07/nufc-set-for-2m-wherever-fraser-forster-goes-72703-31130381/ |title=NUFC set for £2m wherever Fraser Forster goes |newspaper=Evening Chronicle |location=Newcastle |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate= 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle,&lt;ref name=SignsCeltic/&gt; mainly due to the fact that he spent most of his time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraser Forster|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=45689|website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cameron|first1=Neil|title=Fraser Forster: I'm thankful for what Newcastle United did for me|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fraser-forster-im-thankful-what-7771664|accessdate=15 June 2016|newspaper=Evening Chronicle |location=Newcastle |date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Stockport County====
With Krul back for the [[Newcastle United F.C. season 2008-09|2008–09 season]] and Given back to full fitness, it was the turn of Forster to go on loan. He was loaned out to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 2 October 2008, to deputise for regular goalkeeper [[Owain Fôn Williams]] while he was away on international duty with [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 October 2008 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_4236432,00.html |title=Hatters snare Magpies keeper |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster started his first match for Stockport on 7 October in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] second round, where they lost 1–0 away to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Match Report McSweeney wonder strike saves Stockport |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3003462,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013014012/http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0%2C19764%2C11065_3003462%2C00.html |archivedate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his first league match for Stockport on 11 October, where his team drew 1–1 away to [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McSweeney wonder strike saves Stockport |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3003462,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013014012/http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0%2C19764%2C11065_3003462%2C00.html |archivedate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Newcastle on 1 November, after completing his loan stint at Stockport playing six league matches and keeping three clean sheets.&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt;

====Loan to Bristol Rovers====
Forster, having been on the bench for Newcastle on over 20 occasions in the Premier League,&lt;ref name=sway/&gt; needed regular playing experience and subsequently signed a month-loan deal with [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on 31 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5463929,00.html |title=Rovers snap up Magpies keeper |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept two clean sheets in the four league matches he played for them.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; Bristol Rovers asked to extend the loan but Norwich City made a counter offer which was accepted by Newcastle.&lt;ref name=Crisis&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeper crisis at Bristol Rovers as Forster signs for Norwich City|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Keeper-crisis-Bristol-Rovers-Forster-signs-Norwich-City/article-1293680-detail/article.html|website=This is Bristol|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330070810/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Keeper-crisis-Bristol-Rovers-Forster-signs-Norwich-City/article-1293680-detail/article.html|archivedate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Paul Trollope]] was disappointed and commented that the team wanted Forster between the sticks.&lt;ref name=Crisis/&gt; He stated "Fraser has a great career ahead of him".&lt;ref name=StarMaking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballfancast.com/2010/01/football-blogs/star-making-newcastles-fraser-forster |title=A Star in the Making&amp;nbsp;– Newcastle's Fraser Forster |website=Football Fancast |date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Norwich City====
[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] manager [[Paul Lambert]] was keen to sign Forster who he had seen play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers.

On 24 August 2010, Forster joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], originally on a season-long loan from Newcastle.

Due to the calibre of his performance, the Spanish media nicknamed Forster "''La Gran Muralla''" ("The Great Wall").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/08/fraser-forster-great-wall_n_2091816.html |title=Fraser Forster Hailed As The Great Wall By Spanish Press |website=HuffPost |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster continued to impress in domestic matches as well.

Forster's impressive performances for Celtic in the Champions League and involvement with the England international squad led to media reports in October and November 2013 that several clubs, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], were considering to make a bid for the goalkeeper.&lt;ref name=press1&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanderson|first=Jamie|title=Celtic boss Neil Lennon admits Fraser Forster could join Manchester United|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/26/celtic-boss-neil-lennon-admits-fraser-forster-could-join-manchester-united-4162168/|newspaper=Metro |location=London |accessdate=2 November 2013|date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the press speculation, Celtic manager Neil Lennon commented, "It's going to be impossible to keep Fraser, the way he's playing," adding, "Inevitably, I think a huge club will come in and make a huge bid for him."&lt;ref name=press1/&gt;

However, he was defended by manager [[Ronald Koeman]], who stated, "He [Forster] is a great goalkeeper and that doesn't change after this mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Koeman defends Forster after error|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/koeman-defends-forster-after-error-30771841.html|newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin |accessdate=10 February 2015|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another error by Forster a month later in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] led to the only goal in a surprise 1–0 win for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joe|title=Sheffield United 1–0 Southampton: Marc McNulty takes advantage of Fraser Forster fumble as Nigel Clough's Blades cause Capital One Cup upset|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2876456/Sheffield-United-1-0-Southampton-Marc-McNulty-takes-advantage-Fraser-Forster-fumble.html|newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=10 February 2015|date=16 December 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those two mistakes, however, proved to be exceptions, as Forster's form generally continued to be very impressive.

Forster's performance at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 in his fourth match was highly impressive and drew plaudits from many. ''The Gunners'' dominated the match, and had 11 shots on target as opposed to Southampton's three. Forster pulled off a string of saves in what ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described as a "genuinely inspired goalkeeping performance". He saved twice from [[Mesut Özil]] in the first half, saving his first effort at goal with an outstretched leg then parrying his second shot, a volley from close range, away to safety. In the second half a shot from [[Alexis Sánchez]] was saved so spectacularly that Arsenal's [[Olivier Giroud]] was seen to turn towards Forster and applaud the save. A double save near the end of the match from [[Theo Walcott]] helped Southampton secure a hard-fought 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawkes|first=Phil|title=Arsenal 0&amp;nbsp;– 0 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35406894|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Surlis|first=Patrick|title=Arsenal 0–0 Southampton: Fraser Forster denies Gunners in goalless draw|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/arsenal-vs-soton/341417|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Sky Sports|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal 0 Southampton 0: Olivier Giroud applauded Fraser Forster he was so good at the Emirates|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-0-southampton-0-olivier-giroud-applauded-fraser-forster-he-was-so-good-a6850121.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|newspaper=The Independent|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Koeman praised his goalkeeper, hailing his performance as "magic" and describing him as "one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League and maybe in Europe".

On 4 October 2012, [[Roy Hodgson]] included Forster in his [[England national football team|England]] squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref name=EnglandCall&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19828475|title=Forster gets England call|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 October 2012|accessdate= 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November 2012, Forster was then named in Hodgson's England squad for their upcoming friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England Name Squad for Sweden Friendly: Forster, Wilshere, Sterling and Osman Named|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-keeper-fraser-forster-being-1403798|newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=8 November 2012|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2013, Hodgson again included Forster in his England squad, this time for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/celtic-goalkeeper-fraser-forster-in-england-squad-1-2837294 |title=Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster in England squad |newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2013, Forster earned his fourth inclusion to the England squad ahead of the [[World Cup qualifiers]] with [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], joining [[Joe Hart]] and [[John Ruddy]] in competition for the goalkeeper's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/celtic/237512-fraser-forster-recalled-to-england-squad-for-moldova-and-ukraine-qualifiers/ |title=Fraser Forster recalled to England squad for Moldova and Ukraine qualifiers |publisher=STV Sport |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster won his first cap for England on 15 November 2013 in a friendly match against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] at [[Wembley Stadium]]. England lost 2–0 but Forster was "blameless" for both goals, making a "fine diving save" to deny Chile a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24862578 |title=England 0–2 Chile |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appearance against Chile saw Forster become only the second person ever to play for England while a Celtic player, after [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nash|first=Matthew|title=Who are Glasgow Celtic's England internationals?|url=http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2012/10/04/mn-who-are-glasgow-celtics-england-internationals/|website=HITC Sport|accessdate=4 February 2014|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2014, Hodgson named Forster in England's 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27362447 |title=World Cup 2014: England name Ross Barkley in squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England's last warm-up match before the tournament, on 7 June, he replaced Joe Hart for the last 15 minutes of a 0–0 draw with [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNulty|first=Phil|title=England 0–0 Honduras|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27383495|accessdate=8 June 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster travelled to Brazil with the rest of the England squad but did not feature in any of the three matches England played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraser Forster: European trips can keep me in England frame|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/jul/fraser-forster-craves-england-chance|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A knee injury saw Forster miss most of 2015, but his form on returning to playing football in early 2016 earned him a recall to the England squad in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joyce|first1=Paul|title=Southampton and England star Fraser Forster opens up about his 10-month battle with injury|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/655346/Southampton-England-star-Fraser-Forster-opens-up-about-10-month-battle-injury-News-Gossip|accessdate=13 June 2016|newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the second half of England's 3–2 friendly win over [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Berlin, making an impressive save from a [[Marco Reus]] free kick, although later conceded a goal from a [[Mario Gómez]] header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forster makes international return in England win|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20160326-fraser-forster-germany-england-report-3027992.aspx|accessdate=13 June 2016|publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster played the full 90 minutes three days later on 29 March 2016 in a 2–1 loss against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Both goals conceded were controversial; [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]] protesting that the handball that led to the penalty for the Netherlands first goal was not deliberate, while [[Phil Jagielka]] appeared to be fouled in the build-up to [[Luciano Narsingh]]'s winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forster and Clasie feature as England lose to Holland|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20160329-fraser-forster-england-holland-report-3032170.aspx|accessdate=13 June 2016|publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holl&gt;{{cite news|last=Leitch|first=Adam|title=Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster boosts hopes for Euro 2016 despite England losing 2–1 to the Netherlands|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/14390519.Forster_shines_despite_England_loss/|accessdate=13 June 2016|newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the defeat, Forster turned in a composed performance and made several excellent saves.&lt;ref name=holl/&gt; On 31 May 2016, Forster was named in England's 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], albeit he was once again understudy to Joe Hart and did not play in any of England's four matches at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ryan Bertrand and Fraser Forster have been in confirmed in Roy Hodgson's finalised 23-man England squad for Euro 2016|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/14526321.Saints_duo_confirmed_in_England_s_final_Euros_squad/?ref=arc|accessdate=13 June 2016|newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England&amp;nbsp;– squad|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/teams/team=39/squad/index.html|publisher=UEFA |accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Euro 2016, Forster remained an unused substitute in subsequent England matches,&lt;ref name=Jun17/&gt; and was dropped from the squad altogether in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster is left out of the England squad but Ryan Bertrand is named|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/15493842.Forster_axed_from_England_squad/|accessdate=30 August 2017|newspaper=Daily Echo|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Despite his large build, Forster has a high level of agility; Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend said that "he was and is an amazing shot stopper. I've seen him for Southampton save shots he shouldn't, his body bends." In one-on-situations, he appears to make his already large stature even bigger to an onrushing opponent.&lt;ref name=tinl&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=John|title=Fraser Forster: Beating Hart?|url=http://theinsideleft.com/fraser-forster/|website=The Inside Left|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster was, however, criticised in the early part of his time at Celtic for lacking confidence and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet.&lt;ref name=hearts/&gt;&lt;ref name=tinl/&gt; In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.&lt;ref name=tinl/&gt;

==Club career==
===Angers===
Boufal came through the [[Angers SCO|Angers]] youth system, making his debut for the club at the age of 18, replacing [[Rayan Frikeche]] in the closing stages of a 1–0 home loss to [[FC Istres]] in August 2012. He made his first ever professional start the next [[Ligue 2]] season, in a 4–2 win away at [[FC Istres]], becoming a regular that season, making 31 appearances in all competitions.

He racked up a total of 4 goals in 16 appearances in the first half of the season, before attracting interest from [[Ligue 1]] clubs.

'''Jordy Clasie''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈjɔrdi ˈklaːsi}}; born 27 June 1991) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Association football|footballer]] who currently plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Feyenoord]], on loan from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]].

{{TOClimit|3}}

==Club career==
===Early career===
Clasie arrived at the youth [[Feyenoord Academy (Varkenoord)]] as a 9-year-old in the summer of 2000 and progressed through the ranks to the Feyenoord / Excelsior U19s. In the summer of 2010 the Haarlem-born youngster went out on loan to [[S.B.V. Excelsior|Excelsior]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordy Clasie|url=http://www.feyenoord.com/feyenoord-1/selection/jordy-clasie|website=Feyenoord|accessdate=15 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143651/http://www.feyenoord.com/feyenoord-1/selection/jordy-clasie|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clasie made his professional debut for Excelsior on 15 August 2010, when he was part of the starting line-up in the [[Rotterdam derby]] victory against [[Feyenoord]] (3–2).

===Feyenoord===
[[File:Jordy Clasie.jpg|thumb|left|x280px|Clasie after a [[Feyenoord]] match in 2012]]
Clasie was brought into the first-team squad at [[Feyenoord]] at the start of the [[2011–12 Feyenoord season|2011/2012 season]] and incoming coach [[Ronald Koeman]] immediately handed the youngster a place in the starting line-up.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; On 31 July 2011 he made his debut for [[Feyenoord]] in a friendly game against [[Málaga CF|Málaga]]. Because of his good play and his tenacity he soon became one of the most popular players among the supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Excelsior – Feyenoord (15-08-2010) |url=http://www.vi.nl/Wedstrijden/Wedstrijd.htm?dbid=210975&amp;typeofpage=84140 |newspaper=VI |language=Dutch |trans-title=|date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2014, a day after Clasie helped [[Feyenoord]] qualify for the group stage of the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], Clasie agreed to extend his contract until 2018.&lt;ref name="feyenoord1"&gt;[http://www.feyenoord.nl/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/jordy-clasie-tekent-bij-tot-2018 'Jordy Clasie tekent bij tot 2018']. Retrieved from wwww.feyenoord.nl on 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Clasie explained the decision that he was keen on developing himself as a player within the team as well as developing together with the team as a whole.&lt;ref name="feyenoord1"/&gt;

===Southampton===
However, on 15 July 2015, Clasie signed for [[Southampton F.C|Southampton]] on a five-year deal for a fee in the region of £8 million. This meant he would once again link up with [[Ronald Koeman]] who brought him into the Feyenoord first-team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordy Clasie: Southampton sign Dutch midfielder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33545453|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Frenchman [[Claude Puel]] took over at the helm of Southampton. Clasie then scored his first goal for the club on 30 November 2016, in a 2–0 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[EFL Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38073806 |title=Arsenal 0–2 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=1 December  2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clasie's creativity was instrumental in Southampton getting to the [[2016-17 EFL Cup|League Cup final of 2017]] where the Saints eventually emerged as runners up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/14964044.Jordy_Clasie_says_he_doesn_t_feel_like_an_established_Premier_League_player_yet_but_has_set_a_new_ambitious_target/?ref=rl&amp;lp=3|title=Jordy Clause: Feature|work =Daily Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/southamptons-route-efl-cup-final-9902344.amp|title=Southampton's route to the EFL Cup final|work=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/39018813|title=Manchester United 3–2 Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first [[Premier League]] goal on 8 April 2017 in a 1–0 victory  at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/39464041|title=West Brom 0–1 Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club Brugge===
On 30 August 2017, Clasie joined [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] on loan for the duration of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://southamptonfc.com/news/2017-08-30/jordy-clasie-club-brugge-southampton-loan-announcement|title=Clasie joins Club Brugge on loan|publisher=Southampton F.C.|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordy Clasie: Southampton midfielder joins Club Brugge on loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41102415|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feyenoord===
On 25 July 2018, the midfielder rejoined Feyenoord on loan for the duration of the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clasie completes Feyenoord loan switch|url=https://southamptonfc.com/news/2018-07-25/jordy-clasie-southampton-feyenoord-loan-announcementd|publisher=Southampton FC|accessdate=25 July 2018|date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ras-Feyenoorder Jordy Clasie keert terug in de Kuip|url=https://www.feyenoord.nl/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/ras-feyenoorder-jordy-clasie-keert-terug-in-de-kuip|publisher=Feyenoord|language=Dutch|accessdate=25 July 2018|date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In November 2010, two months after his debut for [[S.B.V. Excelsior|Excelsior]], he was selected for the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21 squad]]. In February 2012, Bert van Marwijk, the coach of the first team of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], pronounced his interest in Clasie. He was made aware that his name was on the stand-by list for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].

Clasie was part of [[Louis van Gaal]]'s 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil where the Dutch finished third beating the likes of defending champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].
He made two appearances in the tournament, coming on as a substitute for [[Nigel de Jong]] in the semi-finals against [[Argentina]] and started the third place game against the hosts which the Dutch won 3–0 comfortably.&lt;ref name=WC /&gt;
