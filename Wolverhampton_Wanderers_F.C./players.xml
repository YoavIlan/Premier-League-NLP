==Club career==
===Porto===
Born in [[Mozelos (Santa Maria da Feira)]], [[Aveiro District]], Neves grew up supporting [[FC Porto]] and joined the club's youth system at the age of 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/21/ruben-neves-diogo-jota-wolves-porto-cricket-interview|title=Wolves’ Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota: ‘Porto has wine, food but here it’s fine’|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Stuart|last=James|date=21 September 2018|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PortuGoal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portugoal.net/on-the-rise/356-profile-of-porto-prodigy-ruben-neves|title=Profile of Porto prodigy Rúben Neves|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the academy, he also spent a season on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at [[Padroense F.C.|Padroense]] which acted as the under-16 side;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2132818.html|title=The rapid rise of Rúben Neves|publisher=UEFA|last=Pimentel|first=José Nuno|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his time in the youth structures, [[FC Porto B|reserve team]] manager [[Luís Castro (Portuguese footballer)|Luís Castro]] described him as a player with "extraordinary mental qualities, to go along with technical and tactical skills".&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;

Ahead of the [[2014–15 Primeira Liga|2014–15 campaign]], Neves was earmarked to bypass Porto's under-19s and play with the reserves instead. Following an injury to teammate [[Mikel Agu]], however, he was called by [[Julen Lopetegui]] to be part of the main squad's pre-season preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-tem-um-talento-mental-extraordinario-4070889.html|title=Rúben Neves tem um talento mental extraordinário|trans-title=Rúben Neves has an extraordinary mental talent|newspaper=[[O Jogo]]|language=pt|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2014, aged 17 years and five months, he made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut where he started and scored in a 2–0 home win against [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]] – in doing so, he became the youngest player in the club's history to score a goal in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/liga-fc-porto-maritimo-cronica/53ee72880cf2c1dfdf15bb68.html|title=FC Porto-Marítimo, 2–0 (crónica)|trans-title=FC Porto-Marítimo, 2–0 (report)|publisher=Mais Futebol|last=Almeida|first=Germano|language=pt|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first match in the [[UEFA Champions League]] five days later in a 1–0 win over [[Lille OSC|Lille]], and broke another record (previously held by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) by being the youngest Portuguese to appear in the tournament.&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/liga-campeoes-fc-porto-ruben-neves-cristiano-ronaldo-lille-play-off/53f4eee90cf2103fd4482b11.html|title=Rúben Neves o português mais novo de sempre a jogar na ''Champions''|trans-title=Rúben Neves the youngest Portuguese ever to play in the Champions|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=20 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2014, during a [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group stage]] fixture against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], Neves suffered an injury to his right knee following a collision in midfield with [[Alex Teixeira]]. At the end of the game, the club explained that he suffered a sprain, with apparent damage to the internal lateral ligament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-com-lesao-no-joelho-direito-4288722.html|title=Rúben Neves com lesão no joelho direito|trans-title=Rúben Neves with right knee injury|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending nearly a month on the sidelines, he returned to the pitch in a [[2014–15 Taça da Liga|3–1 home win]] over [[C.F. União|União da Madeira]] in the [[Taça da Liga]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/fc-porto/detalhe/ruben-neves-regressa-aos-convocados-924835.html|title=Rúben Neves regressa aos convocados|trans-title=Rúben Neves returns to squad|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his injury, his role in midfield was filled by [[Casemiro]] and he spent the majority of the remainder of the season behind the Brazilian in the pecking order.&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;

On 20 October 2015, aged 18 years and 221 days, Neves became the youngest player to start as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in the Champions League, helping Porto to a 2–0 win against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] in [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|the group phase]] and surpassing previous record holder [[Rafael van der Vaart]], who held it since 16 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2296033.html|title=Porto's Rúben Neves, Iker Casillas make history|publisher=UEFA|date=20 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, in a 2–1 success over [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira|Paços de Ferreira]] also at the [[Estádio do Dragão]], he broke another record by becoming the youngest player to achieve 50 games for the club, surpassing players like [[Fernando Gomes (footballer)|Fernando Gomes]] and [[Jaime Magalhães]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-e-o-mais-jovem-a-completar-50-jogos-4917762.html|title=Rúben Neves é o mais jovem a completar 50 jogos|trans-title=Rúben Neves is the youngest to complete 50 games|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=6 December 2015|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves scored his second competitive goal on 3 February 2016, opening the scoreline in a 3–0 triumph at [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]] for [[2015–16 Taça de Portugal|the semi-finals]] of the [[Taça de Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/nunca-e-facil-mudar-de-estrategia-5014013.html|title=Nunca é fácil mudar de estratégia|trans-title="It is never easy to change strategy"|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Ruben Neves avec la selection.jpg|thumb|upright|Neves playing for [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal U17]] in 2014]]Neves represented [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal]] at the [[2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]], helping the country reach the semi-finals as [[Captain (association football)|team captain]]. For his performances, he was named among the top ten talents of the tournament by a selection of [[UEFA]] reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=2106764.html|title=Ten under-17 players to keep an eye on|publisher=UEFA|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2014, still aged 17, Neves was called by coach [[Rui Jorge]] to be part of the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21 side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/seleccao/euro_sub_21/artigo/2014/08/29/portugal-sub-21-sporting-domina-convocat-ria-ruben-neves-chamado|title=Sporting domina convocatória, Ruben Neves chamado|trans-title=Sporting dominate list, Ruben Neves called|publisher=[[SAPO (company)|SAPO]]|language=pt|date=29 August 2014|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on 14 October, helping to a 5–4 home win against the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]] for [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification|the playoff round]] of the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000413/match=2015238/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Portugal through after nine-goal thriller|publisher=UEFA|date=14 October 2014|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the finals began in the Czech Republic, Neves broke a new record by becoming the youngest player to debut for the Portuguese under-21s in the tournament, aged 18 years and three months, playing five minutes to help beat [[England national under-21 football team|England]] 1–0 in the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship#Group B|group stage]] opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/seleccao/portugal/artigo/2015/06/19/ruben-neves-quebra-recorde-mas-quer-mais-nao-posso-abrandar|title=Rúben Neves quebra recorde mas quer mais: "Não posso abrandar"|trans-title=Ruben Neves breaks record but wants more: "I can't slow down"|publisher=SAPO|language=pt|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his only appearance, as the country reached [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship Final|the final]] and lost it to [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name=UEFA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000411/match=2015383/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Spot-on Sweden beat Portugal to win U21 EURO|publisher=UEFA|last=Kell|first=Tom|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves was first called up to [[Portugal national football team|the senior squad]] on 10 November 2015, ahead of [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] as an injury replacement for [[João Moutinho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/618334/Liverpool-Chelsea-Ruben-Neves-Porto-international-debut-Portugal|title=Liverpool and Chelsea target in high demand as youngster set to make international debut|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|last=Gray|first=James|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the former match, featuring 17 minutes in the 0–1 loss in [[Krasnodar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/news/newsid=2304930.html|title=Rússia vence Portugal em Krasnodar|trans-title=Russia beat Portugal in Krasnodar|publisher=UEFA|language=pt|date=14 November 2015|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then played the entire 2–0 win against the latter at the [[Stade Josy Barthel]], sharing the midfield area with Porto teammates [[Danilo Pereira (Portuguese footballer)|Danilo Pereira]] and [[André André]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/selecao/andre-andre/luxemburgo-portugal-2-0-cronica|title=Luxemburgo-Portugal, 0–2 (crónica)|trans-title=Luxembourg-Portugal, 0–2 (report)|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/internacional/selecao/noticias/interior/aproveitamos-o-meiocampo-do-fc-porto-4889964.html|title=Aproveitamos o meio-campo do FC Porto|trans-title=We took advantage of the FC Porto midfield|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves was selected by full side manager [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] to a preliminary 35-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad – 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced?|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not make the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/portugal-world-cup-squad|title=Nearly half Portugal's Euro squad to miss World Cup|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
An article on [[UEFA|UEFA.com]] described Neves as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] who is not afraid to go forward and prompt attacks, showing great maturity combined with an accurate passing skill, great vision and an astute sense of positioning. His playing attributes also granted him comparisons to Portuguese international teammate Moutinho for his fine first touch, similar desire to press his opponents and excellent distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=por/news/newsid=2241045.html|title=UEFA.com's weekly wonderkid: Rúben Neves|publisher=UEFA|date=2 May 2015|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves also drew praise in the media for his technical, tactical and mental qualities,&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt; as well as his intelligence and shooting ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/the-portuguese-star-who-broke-the-records-of-ronaldo-ready-to-jo-72883|title=The Portuguese star who broke the records of Ronaldo ready to join Juventus|publisher=Calcio Mercato|last=Laurenti|first=Mirko|date=23 November 2018|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rui Pedro dos Santos Patrício''' {{small|[[Order of Merit (Portugal)|ComM]]}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈʁuj pɐˈtɾisju}}; born 15 February 1988) is a Portuguese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]].

Before moving to England, he spent most of his career with [[Sporting CP]], making his debut with the first team at only 18 and going on to appear in 467 official games. He won five trophies during his 12-year spell there, including two [[Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cups]].

Patrício earned his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for Portugal in 2010, after [[Paulo Bento]]'s appointment as head coach. He represented the nation in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] and three [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]], winning the [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016 edition]] of the latter tournament.

==Club career==
===Sporting===
Born in Marrazes, [[Leiria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/liga/sporting/patricio-inaugura-estatua-em-leiria-que-seja-exemplo-para-mais-novos|title=Patrício inaugura estátua em Leiria: "Que seja exemplo para mais novos"|trans-title=Patrício inaugurates statue in Leiria: «Let it be an example for the young ones»|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=22 May 2017|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrício played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] at a young age. Reportedly, a [[Sporting CP]] scout was in the area and saw him play [[Goalkeeper (association football)|in goal]], being impressed enough to sign the 12-year-old to the club's youth academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/desporto/detalhe/heroi-ja-foi-avancado|title=Herói já foi avançado|trans-title=Hero used to be a forward|newspaper=[[Correio da Manhã]]|language=pt|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut on 19 November 2006, in a 1–0 away win against [[C.S. Marítimo]] in the tenth round: standing in for habitual club and [[Portugal national football team|country]] first-choice [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]], he saved a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] 15 minutes before the end of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=289099|title=Rui Patrício entra na história|trans-title=Rui Patrício makes history|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rui Patrício.jpg|left|thumb|271x271px|Patrício with Sporting in 2012]]
In the [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|2007–08 season]], after Ricardo's departure to [[Real Betis]], Patrício beat competition from Sporting veteran [[Tiago Ferreira (footballer, born 1975)|Tiago]] and new signing [[Vladimir Stojković]] to become the undisputed starter. He made his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut on 27 November 2007, in a [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|1–2 group stage loss]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2008/matches/round=15105/match=301234/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Ronaldo underlines United authority|publisher=UEFA|date=27 November 2007|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 off-season, Patrício was the subject of a rumored transfer to Italian giants [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=791670&amp;idCanal=24|title=Rui Patrício por Toldo|trans-title=Rui Patrício for Toldo|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809164349/http://www.record.pt/noticia.asp?id=791670&amp;idCanal=24|archivedate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing came of it, however, and in [[2008 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|that year]]'s [[Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Portuguese Supercup]] final, against [[FC Porto]], he stopped a [[Lucho González]] penalty in a 2–0 final success,&lt;ref name=SUPERCUP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=739742.html|title=Djaló double steers Sporting success|publisher=UEFA|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also being an everpresent fixture in [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|the league]].

In the qualifying rounds of the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|2009–10 Champions League]], at [[FC Twente]], Sporting were trailing 0–1 in the 94th minute, after a 0–0 tie in the first leg: Patrício rushed to the opposing area for a [[corner kick]], where he went up for a header with [[Nikita Rukavytsya]]. Both players seemed to make contact with the ball, and it was helped into the net for an [[own goal]] via the boot of [[Peter Wisgerhof]] as the latter side eventually qualified for the last games prior to the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000026/match=2000341/index.html|title=Sporting late show shatters Twente|publisher=UEFA|date=4 August 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2012, Patrício was awarded Sporting's Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref name="POY12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Sporting//interior.aspx?content_id=795037|title=Vencedores dos prémios Stromp|trans-title=Stromp awards winners|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226102314/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=795037|archivedate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2014, with the score at 2–1 for his team, he saved a penalty by [[Jackson Martínez]] to help [[2014–15 Taça de Portugal|oust Porto]] from the [[Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]] with a 3–1 win at the ''[[Estádio do Dragão]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugoal.net/club-news/77-sporting-dump-porto-out-of-the-portuguese-cup|title=Sporting dump Porto out of the Portuguese Cup|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2016, Patrício was one of 30 players nominated for the 2016 [[Ballon d'Or]] award alongside [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] teammates [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/story/2980138/ballon-dor-nominees-cristiano-ronaldo-and-lionel-messi-lead-list-of-30|title=Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi lead list of 30 nominees|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|last=Holyman|first=Ian|date=24 October 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following 18 February he appeared in his 400th competitive game with Sporting, putting on a [[Man of the match]] performance in a 1–0 home win against [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting.pt/en/news/football/main-team/2017-02-19/sporting-cp-1-rio-ave-0|title=Patrício secures 400th {{sic|nolink=y|apperance}} with fantastic performance|publisher=Sporting CP|date=18 February 2017|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2018, Patrício and several of his teammates, including coaches, were injured following an attack by around 50 supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground after the team [[2017–18 Primeira Liga|finished third in the league]] and missed out on [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|Champions League qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abola.pt/Nnh/Noticias/Ver/730529|title=Jesus e jogadores agredidos na Academia|trans-title=Jesus and players attacked at the Academy|newspaper=[[A Bola]]|language=pt|date=15 May 2018|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/sporting-lisbon-attack-160186|title=Sporting Lisbon players attacked at training ground after failing to secure Champions League spot|publisher=Sports Joe|last=Kiley|first=Ben|date=15 May 2018|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the events, he and the rest of the team agreed to play in the [[2018 Taça de Portugal Final|Portuguese Cup final]] scheduled for the following weekend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/44142885|title=Sporting Lisbon: Players agree to play Portuguese Cup final after attack|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=16 May 2018|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually losing to [[C.D.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 1 June 2018, Patrício submitted a request to terminate his Sporting contract with grounds for just cause, due to the dressing room violence from supporters as well as seeing an €18&amp;nbsp;million move to newly promoted [[Premier League]] team [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] fall through, after Sporting president [[Bruno de Carvalho]] pulled out of negotiations at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abola.pt/img/carta-rui-patricio-A.pdf|title=Rescisão com justa causa do contrato de trabalho desportivo|trans-title=Just cause termination of sporting work contract|newspaper=A Bola|language=pt|date=31 May 2018|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwese.espn.com/football/soccer-transfers/story/3515658/rui-patricio-wants-sporting-deal-terminated-as-jorge-mendes-accused-of-blackmail|title=Rui Patricio wants Sporting deal terminated as Jorge Mendes accused of 'blackmail'|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2 June 2018|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the move on 18 June, on a four-year deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20180618-wolves-complete-patricio-signing/|title=Wolves complete Patricio signing|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=18 June 2018|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was announced on 31 October that both clubs had agreed a €18&amp;nbsp;million deal as settlement of his departure to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46052450|title=Rui Patricio: Wolves agree £16m fee with Sporting Lisbon for goalkeeper|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrício opted to wear the No.11 shirt for Wolves as opposed to the habitual No.1, in honour of [[Carl Ikeme]], who had just retired following treatment for [[Acute leukemia|acute leukaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2018/08/10/rui-patricio-honours-carl-ikeme-as-wolves-reveal-new-kit-numbers/|title=Rui Patricio honours Carl Ikeme as Wolves reveal new kit numbers|newspaper=[[Express &amp; Star]]|last=Hatfield|first=Luke|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut on 11 August 2018, in a 2–2 home draw against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45067374|title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–2 Everton|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Hafez|first=Shamoon|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Rui Patrício 2017.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|Patrício with Portugal at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|2017 Confederations Cup]]]]
From 2007, Patrício started appearing for the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portuguese under-21 side]]. On 29 January of the following year, [[Portugal national football team|senior team]] coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] called him up for a 1–3 [[Exhibition game|friendly]] defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Zürich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=331094|title=Rui Patrício chamado por Scolari|trans-title=Rui Patrício called by Scolari|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=29 January 2008|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he did not leave the bench; on 12 May he was picked to the squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008]], but did not play in the tournament.

Although not part of the provisional 24-player list for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=9126513|title=Convocados revelados|trans-title=Squad revealed|publisher=[[Portuguese Football Federation]]|language=pt|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615170243/http://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=9126513|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1208424/index.html|title=Pepe in Portugal squad|publisher=FIFA|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrício was named in a backup list of six players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/20/86/87/provisional1305.pdf|title=Release list of up to 30 players|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 17 November 2010, playing the second half of a 4–0 friendly win with [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/news/detail/item533498/Portugal-4-0-Spain/|title=Portugal 4–0 Spain|publisher=[[ESPN Star Sports]]|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=11 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731010828/http://www.espnstar.com/football/news/detail/item533498/Portugal-4-0-Spain/|archivedate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Eduardo Carvalho|Eduardo]] was relegated to the bench at his new club, [[S.L. Benfica]], Patrício became the starter under national team boss [[Paulo Bento]], and both players finished the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifying campaign]] with five games (450 minutes) as Portugal qualified for the final stages. He was the starter in the finals in [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], conceding four goals in five matches in an eventual semi-final exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15174/match=2003378/postmatch/report/index.html#spain+survive+test+nerve+reach+final|title=Spain survive test of nerve to reach final|publisher=UEFA|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrício was included in Bento's 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] as first-choice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/portugal/10810443/Portugal-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Portugal World Cup 2014 squad|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut in [[FIFA World Cup|the competition]] in the first encounter against [[Germany national football team|Germany]], which ended with a 0–4 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=6/news=german-lessons-for-cr7-s-portugal-2373410.html|title=Muller-inspired Germany thrash ten-man Portugal|publisher=FIFA|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed the second game against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2660580/Portugal-defender-Fabio-Coentrao-ruled-rest-World-Cup-thigh-injury.html|title=Portugal defender Fabio Coentrao ruled out for rest of the World Cup with thigh injury|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrício appeared in his 50th international on 30 June 2016, during [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]: after the 1–1 draw to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at the ''[[Stade Vélodrome]]'' during the first 120 minutes, he saved [[Jakub Błaszczykowski]]'s attempt in a 5–3 [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] win that qualified to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000449/match=2017901/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Draw specialists Portugal beat Poland on penalties|publisher=UEFA|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won the tournament with a solid display in [[UEFA Euro 2016 Final|the final]],&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36696772|title=Portugal 1–0 France|publisher=BBC Sport|last=McNulty|first=Phil|date=10 July 2016|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also made the squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/portugal-world-cup-squad|title=Nearly half Portugal's Euro squad to miss World Cup|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Thomas Gordon Ruddy''' (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|WolverhW}} club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

Ruddy began his career at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], before signing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a 19-year-old. He spent five years with Everton, but made just one appearance, while playing on loan at nine different clubs. Ruddy was signed by [[Paul Lambert]] to play for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], gaining promotion to the Premier League.

The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager [[Roy Hodgson]] for the squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. However, on 25 May 2012, he was ruled out after breaking his finger during training. He made his debut in a 2–1 win against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in August 2012. He suffered a long term thigh injury in November 2012, but returned to help Norwich to an 11th-place finish at the end of the [[2012–13 Premier League]] season. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.

==Club career==
===Cambridge United===
Born in [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire]],&lt;ref name=Hugman0910/&gt; Ruddy began his career at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and made his professional debut in the final match of the 2003–04 season at [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]'s [[Brisbane Road]] stadium on 8 May 2004, keeping a [[clean sheet]] and saving a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Ruddy earned his place as Cambridge's first choice keeper in the 2004–05 season, making 38 appearances in a season that saw the U's relegated from league two after finishing bottom with 30 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-two/2004-2005 |title=English League Two 2004–2005 Table |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=19 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428130211/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-two/2004-2005 |archivedate=28 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite Ruddy's tremendous efforts, which included keeping 9 clean sheets and conceding just 45 goals.&lt;ref name=sb0405/&gt;

===Everton===
Ruddy had a trial at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in November 2004, before moving to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the summer of 2005 for a fee of around £250,000 that would rise depending on appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/4565337.stm |title=Ruddy completes Goodison switch |date=20 May 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy was called into the England Under-19 squad in 2005 after being scouted by England goalkeeping coach [[Ray Clemence]] and was touted by his manager [[David Moyes]] as a future England goalkeeper.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In September 2005, Ruddy signed for [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-s-walsall-loan-move.html |title=Ruddy's Walsall loan move |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=23 September 2005 |first=Scott |last=McLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; making four appearances in [[EFL League One|League One]] before returning to Everton.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Loan spells with [[Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C.|Rushden &amp; Diamonds]] and [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] followed.&lt;ref name=rush&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-switches-to-stockport.html |title=Ruddy switches to Stockport |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=12 September 2006 |publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy made his first and only appearance for Everton in February 2006 in unusual circumstances. Nine minutes into the match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Iain Turner]] was sent off for handling outside the area. Since Turner was substituting for injured first- and second-choice keepers [[Nigel Martyn]] and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]], it meant that Ruddy was the only keeper left who could play. Ruddy went on to keep a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4680522.stm|title=Everton 1–0 Blackburn|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2006|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Ruddy went on loan again. A one-month deal was agreed with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]],&lt;ref name=rush/&gt; which was extended to three months after some impressive performances.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He then agreed a one-month loan with [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11671_2405198,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Wrexham hire Ruddy |first=Lewis |last=Rutledge |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1014027,00.html |publisher=Bristol City F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |title=Ruddy solves keeping crisis |date=22 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231955/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10327~1014027%2C00.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over [[Carlisle United F.C|Carlisle United]], and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In January 2009, he went out on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-joins-crewe.html |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |title=Ruddy joins Crewe |date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherwell===
On 24 July 2009, Ruddy joined [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on a six-month loan deal, to vie with [[Michael Fraser (footballer)|Michael Fraser]] and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8168189.stm|title=Well sign Everton keeper on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy kept clean sheets during a 0–0 home draw against Rangers on 12 September 2009 and a 0–0 away draw against Celtic on 17 October 2009.&lt;ref name=Soccerway/&gt; He also saved a Barry Robson penalty in a 3–2 loss to Celtic on 12 December 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When the original loan deal expired in January 2010, the Fir Park club decided that they wanted to keep Ruddy for longer and an extension of a month was agreed with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 27 January 2010, it was announced that both Ruddy and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] teammate [[Lukas Jutkiewicz]] were to extend their stay at the Scottish Premier League club until May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/duo-extend-loans-until-may.html|title=Duo Extend Loans Until May|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy finished the Scottish Premier League season with 15 clean sheets from 34 appearances.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Norwich City===
[[File:Ruddy.JPG|thumb|upright|Ruddy celebrating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s promotion into the [[Premier League]] in 2011]]

On 5 July 2010, Ruddy signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for an undisclosed fee, which Ruddy revealed in 2017 to have been £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39843745|title=John Ruddy: Norwich City goalkeeper not surprised by release from Carrow Road|date=8 May 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Paul Lambert]] revealed that on two earlier occasions he had considered signing Ruddy for clubs he'd previously managed: "It is funny but&amp;nbsp;... [I]&amp;nbsp;... went to watch him for Crewe at MK Dons&amp;nbsp;... but he had an absolute stinker. We also saw him when he was at Stockport and&amp;nbsp;... I decided against him at that time, but when [[Fraser Forster|Fraser]] went and it was clear we wouldn't be able to get him back again I knew John had had a really good season at Motherwell. There was that clamour to sign Fraser, but with the finances we just couldn't do that. I wanted somebody with the same stature, a big goalkeeper, and John had that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraser Forster is top class – Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city-fc/fraser_forster_is_top_class_norwich_city_goalkeeper_john_ruddy_1_1408885|newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy made his debut for City against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the opening fixture of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] which Norwich lost 3–2 at [[Carrow Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8880936.stm|title=Norwich 2–3 Watford|date=6 August 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 1–0 away win against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] on 14 August 2010, following this up with another clean sheet against Swansea on 21 August 2010 which included a penalty save that atoned for his error that led to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8918635.stm |title=Norwich 2–0 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ruddy's first season for Norwich, he played 45 out of the 46 league matches, helping City to the [[Premier League]], keeping a clean sheet during the 1–0 away win against Portsmouth on 2 May 2011 which sealed promotion for the Canaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fletcher |first=Paul |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13185001 |title=Norwich seal Premier League place |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy started the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]] as the first choice keeper again for Norwich, starting the 1–1 draw at the [[DW Stadium]] against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14429588.stm|title=Wigan 1–1 Norwich|date=13 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up by making numerous good saves during Norwich's first home premier league match in seven years in a 1–1 draw against Stoke, including a penalty stop against Jon Walters and a save denying Matthew Etherington from a direct free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14520268 |title=Norwich 1–1 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next match, he received his only red card of the season in the match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] after a foul on [[Ramires]] that led to a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14600575.stm|title=Chelsea 3–1 Norwich|date=27 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ruddy's fortunes were reversed during the return fixture against Chelsea on 21 January 2012 when he kept his first clean sheet of the season during a 0–0 draw at Carrow Road, making several impressive stops from Fernando Torres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Owen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16559646 |title=Norwich 0–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy was voted Player's Player of the Season following Norwich's 12th-place finish,&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/News/2012/john-ruddy-norwich-euro-2012-call-up-wedding |title=Ruddy's big summer |publisher=The Football Association |date=16 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202150206/http://www.thefa.com/England/News/2012/john-ruddy-norwich-euro-2012-call-up-wedding |archivedate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a testament to Ruddy's performances for a highly attacking Norwich team, leading to suggestions that he should be called up for Roy Hodgson's England Euro 2012 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/9622844.stm |title=Norwich boss Lambert leads the 'Ruddy for England' calls |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=24 October 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy's claim for a squad place was only strengthened by his excellent performance during the 2–0 home win against Aston Villa on the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darling |first=Kevin |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973120 |title=Norwich 2–0 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012–13 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of [[Declan Rudd]], [[Jed Steer]] and new goalie [[Mark Bunn (English footballer)|Mark Bunn]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1–1 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although [[Bobby Zamora]] scored the rebound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Osborne |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19304497 |title=Norwich 1–1 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1–0 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1–1 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hughton dealt injury blow as first choice goalkeeper Ruddy is ruled out for three months|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2239947/John-Ruddy-ruled-months.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norwich City: John Ruddy muscle 'ripped off bone'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21078118|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4–0 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Graham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22417730 |title= Norwich 4–0 West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3–2 away win against Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shemilt |first=Stephan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499159 |title=Man City 2–3 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the previous long term injury, Ruddy started the 2013–14 season as Norwich's first choice keeper in the 2–2 draw with Everton at Carrow Road on 17 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Owen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644749 |title=Norwich 2–2 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy had a tough start to the season which included mistake riddled performances against Spurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reddy |first=Luke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23999467 |title=Tottenham 2–0 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Gary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24350208 |title=Norwich City 1–3 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Gary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24681355 |title=Manchester City 7–0 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 5–1 away thrashing at Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henson |first=Mike |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25115744 |title=Liverpool 5–1 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy has been in fine form keeping four clean sheets in nine matches, conceding just seven goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/norwich-city/results |title=Norwich City Results |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this spell Ruddy produced some outstanding performances, including the 2–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion on 7 December 2013 where he saved eight shots, including a brilliant tip around the post from a close range Shane Long header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25164355 |title=West Bromwich Albion 0–2 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, it was announced that Ruddy would be released when his contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39780816 |title=Norwich City: John Ruddy &amp; Sebastien Bassong among seven released by Canaries |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the players who were being released were given the option of whether or not they chose to be available for selection in the one remaining match of the season. In the end, Ruddy was the only one of the seven who played in the match, being made team captain for the day (he had previously captained the side for one match in the 2013–14 season when [[Sébastien Bassong]] and [[Russell Martin (footballer)|Russell Martin]] were both absent) and saw out his time with the club by keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/john-ruddy-thankful-for-his-opportunity-to-enjoy-a-fantastic-farewell-appearance-for-norwich-city-1-5006782|title=Norwich City: John Ruddy thankful for his opportunity to enjoy a 'fantastic' farewell appearance for Norwich City |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich |date=7 May 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 10 July 2017, Ruddy signed a two-year contract with Championship club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20170710-wolves-snap-up-experienced-keeper/ |title=Wolves snap up experienced 'keeper |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His signing came days after the club's previous number one [[Carl Ikeme]] was diagnosed with acute leukaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/wolves-goalkeeper-carl-ikeme-diagnosed-10750504|title=Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme diagnosed with acute leukaemia|last=Domin|first=Martin|date=6 July 2017|newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2018, Ruddy saved an injury time penalty from [[Gary Madine]] away at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in a 1–0 win, in a victory that took Wolves nine points clear of Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/06/wolves-survive-two-injury-time-cardiff-penalties-edge-closer/|title=Wolves survive two injury-time Cardiff penalties to edge closer to Championship title|publisher=Telegraph|date=6 April 2018|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy became the team's main goalkeeper and was part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League as champions.

In August 2018 he extended his contract with Wolves, signing a deal due to last until summer 2020, despite having fallen behind new addition [[Rui Patrício]] as the club's first-choice goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==International career==
On 16 May 2012, Ruddy received his first senior international call-up when [[Roy Hodgson]] selected him as a member of the [[England national football team|England]] squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norwich City's John Ruddy named in England's Euro 2012 squad, but Grant Holt misses out|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city-fc/norwich_city_s_john_ruddy_named_in_england_s_euro_2012_squad_but_grant_holt_misses_out_1_1379272 |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a broken finger ruled him out of the tournament, and [[Jack Butland]] was called up to replace him.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Ruddy was called up for the friendly against Italy in [[Bern]], Switzerland, on 10 August 2012, along with Butland and [[Joe Hart]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He came on for Butland at half-time to make his senior England debut, and made some key saves as England won the match 2–1, keeping a clean sheet in his first England appearance after Butland conceded in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |title=England 2–1 Italy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19238374 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy was not included in Hodgson's World Cup squad, with Joe Hart, [[Fraser Forster]] and [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] selected instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2014: England name Ross Barkley in squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27362447 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''João Filipe Iria Santos Moutinho''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʒwɐ̃w fɨˈlip iˈɾi.ɐ ˈsɐ̃tuʒ mo(w)ˈtĩɲu}}; born 8 September 1986) is a Portuguese [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]]. Mainly a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], he can also operate as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive]] or [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and on either [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|flank]].

He began his professional career with [[Sporting CP|Sporting]], moving in 2010 to [[FC Porto|Porto]] and winning 12 major titles between the two clubs combined. Three years later he transferred to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] for €25 million, conquering the [[Ligue 1]] championship in the [[2016–17 Ligue 1|2016–17 season]].

Moutinho represented the Portuguese national team at three [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]] and two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], winning the [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016 edition]] of the former tournament.

==Club career==
===Sporting===
Moutinho was born in [[Barreiro, Portugal|Barreiro]], [[Setúbal District]].&lt;ref name=MF/&gt; After showing great promise as a boy playing for [[Portimonense S.C.|Portimonense SC]], he signed with [[Sporting CP]] when he turned 13 to continue his [[Sporting CP Youth and Academy|football education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2005/interior/um-dia-especial-para-o-cla-moutinho-612994.html|title=Um dia especial para o clã Moutinho|trans-title=A special day for the Moutinho clan|newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]]|author=Tiago Silva Pires|language=pt|date=19 March 2005|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2004–05 pre-season, at only 17 years of age, Moutinho was called by manager [[José Peseiro]] to the main squad, where he played some games and displayed some talent early on. However, he then returned to the junior team coached by [[Paulo Bento]] and featured alongside such players such as [[Miguel Veloso]] and [[Nani]], helping the side win the national title that season, although he was also regularly training with the main squad.

In the beginning of 2005, Moutinho was called up for a game in the [[Taça de Portugal]], eventually playing 20 minutes against [[F.C. Pampilhosa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/sporting/detalhe/joao-moutinho-celebra-2-anos-de-carreira.html|title=João Moutinho celebra 2 anos de carreira|trans-title=João Moutinho celebrates 2 years in career|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=5 January 2007|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut on 23 January, staying in the entire 3–0 win at [[Gil Vicente F.C.]] and wearing the #28 shirt previously worn by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=224105|title=A vez de Moutinho|trans-title=Moutinho's turn|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=23 January 2005|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on highly consistent displays, he wasted no time in establishing himself as a regular while being able to play in any position across a flat midfield or in a diamond formation; his box-to-box dynamism and determination quickly made him a firm fan favourite, as he rarely missed a game since becoming first-choice.&lt;ref name=Untouchable&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/seleccao/interior/joao-moutinhoo-indispensavel-que-faz-os-outros-brilhar-5169613.html|title=João Moutinho.

[[File:Sporting Clube de Portugal vs Sporting Clube de Braga 02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moutinho (right) battling [[João Pereira (Portuguese footballer)|João Pereira]] in 2009]]
In [[2005–06 Primeira Liga|his first full season]], Moutinho's further progress and exceptional consistency (he was the only player to play every minute of every match in the domestic league) was one of the brightest spots in Sporting's runner-up final place. Incidentally, he scored his team's final goal of the campaign, a 1–0 win over [[S.C. Braga]] to ensure a [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|return]] to [[UEFA Champions League]] football for the [[Lisbon]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=268906|title=Um campeonato para Moutinho|trans-title=A championship for Moutinho|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=6 May 2006|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|2006–07]], following the departure of veteran [[Ricardo Sá Pinto]], Moutinho was made vice-captain at just 19 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2006/10/22/jornal/joao-moutinho-o-simbolo-posronaldo-103424|title=João Moutinho, o símbolo pós-Ronaldo|trans-title=João Moutinho, the post-Ronaldo symbol|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|author=Filipe Escobar de Lima|language=pt|date=22 October 2006|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|The following season]], after [[Custódio Castro|Custódio]] and [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] also left, he would be named [[Captain (association football)|captain]], the second youngest in the history of the club's professional football, behind first captain and associate founder Francisco Stromp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/detalhe/joao-moutinho-queremos-mostrar-o-que-valemos-308586.html|title=João Moutinho: "Queremos mostrar o que valemos"|trans-title=João Moutinho: "We want to show our worth"|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=12 June 2007|accessdate=16 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119152724/http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/detalhe/joao-moutinho-queremos-mostrar-o-que-valemos-308586.html|archivedate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=334203|title=Moutinho: "Culpa é da equipa por permitir remate"|trans-title=Moutinho: "Team is to blame for allowing shot"|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That campaign, with [[Leandro Romagnoli]] (an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]]) also in the starting eleven, Moutinho, more often than not, moved from his natural "behind-the-forwards" midfield role to the right flank, where he still managed to deliver impressive performances. Additionally, he began earning plaudits as one of the league's top players.

In [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|2008–09]], after an aborted deal with [[Premier League]]'s [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/7527890.stm Everton bid for Moutinho rejected]; [[BBC Sport]], 27 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7546760.stm Fulham sign Johnson from Everton]; BBC Sport, 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moutinho was again ever present, only missing three league matches (almost 50 presences overall) as Sporting finished once again runners-up; he also had the dubious distinction of netting his side's only goal in the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]] clash against [[FC Bayern Munich]], a 1–12 aggregate loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7936200.stm B Munich 7–1 Sporting (agg 12–1)]; BBC Sport, 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto===
[[File:João Moutinho 6297.jpg|thumb|180px|Moutinho playing for Porto in 2011]]
On 3 July 2010, Moutinho signed a five-year contract with Sporting rivals [[FC Porto]], with the transfer price reaching [[Euro|€]]11 million (€1M being paid for 50% of the rights to [[Defender (association football)#Centre back|central defender]] [[Nuno André Coelho]]); additionally, Sporting would receive 25% of any added value (Portuguese: ''mais valia'') occurring during that time frame, provided it surpassed the previous value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1503025.html Moutinho swaps Sporting for Porto]; UEFA, 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/joaomoutinho05072010.pdf|title=Comunicado João Moutinho|trans-title=João Moutinho announcement|publisher=FC Porto|language=pt|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=6 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813155316/http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/joaomoutinho05072010.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporting Chairman [[José Eduardo Bettencourt]] described Moutinho's conduct as deplorable and called him a "rotten apple", adding: "The deal was done because Sporting wanted it, because it did not want a rotten apple in its orchard, and it did not want someone who was not an example, nor dignified the flag of the club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/sporting/detalhe/bettencourt-uma-maca-podre-que-iria-contaminar-o-grupo.html|title=Bettencourt: "Uma maçã podre que iria contaminar o grupo"|trans-title=Bettencourt: "A rotten apple that would contaminate the group"|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Porto sold 37.5% of the player's economic rights to a [[Third-party ownership in association football|third party]], Mamers BV, for €4,125,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/Ingles/RCConsolidado20092010INGLES.pdf|title=Report and consolidated accounts 2009/2010|publisher=FC Porto|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=18 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125204315/http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/Ingles/RCConsolidado20092010INGLES.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moutinho was an ever-present figure for Porto in [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|his first season]]. He appeared in 50 official games as the [[Porto|northerners]] won the league and, even though he did not score in league competition, he netted twice in [[2010–11 Taça de Portugal|the campaign]]'s [[Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]], most notably in a 3–1 away win against [[S.L. Benfica]], with his team overcoming the 0–2 home loss in the first leg to reach [[2011 Taça de Portugal Final|the final]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-portuguese-cup-news/23294-benfica-porto-live-text-commentary Benfica have no answer to Porto brilliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514034748/http://portugoal.net/index.php/more-portuguese-cup-news/23294-benfica-porto-live-text-commentary|date=14 May 2011}}; PortuGOAL, 20 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in which the player also appeared, against [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]] (6–2);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2011/05/22/desporto/noticia/tambem-o-jamor-e-o-destino-do-fc-porto-1495361|title=Também o Jamor é o destino do FC Porto|trans-title=Jamor is FC Porto's destiny as well|newspaper=Público|language=pt|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he added another 90 minutes in the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2011 UEFA Europa League Final|final]], and the club won [[Treble (association football)|the treble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/europa_league/1.1027395|title=Falcao doet Porto zegevieren in Europa League|trans-title=Falcao makes Porto prevail in Europa League|publisher=[[Sporza]]|language=nl|date=18 May 2011|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2011, Porto partnered with [[Soccer Invest Fund]] to buy back 37.5% of Moutinho's economic rights. The private investment fund acquired 15% after the overall transactions, while Porto recouped 22.5% for €4 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/ir_RecompraMoutinho_03082011.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=FC Porto|language=pt|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224112350/http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/ir_RecompraMoutinho_03082011.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the residual 15% was acquired by Porto in 2013, for €3.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/ir_recompraMoutinho15_30012013.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=FC Porto|language=pt|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=2 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923075153/http://www.fcporto.pt/IncFCP/PDF/Investor_Relations/FactosRelevantes/ir_recompraMoutinho15_30012013.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moutinho scored a rare goal on 19 February 2013, helping his team to a 1–0 home win over [[Málaga CF]] for [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|the season's Champions League round-of-16]], netting from close range after an [[Alex Sandro]] cross (eventual 1–2 aggregate loss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000348/match=2009587/postmatch/report/index.html#moutinho+gives+porto+edge|title=Moutinho earns Porto the edge|publisher=UEFA|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 43 contests during [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|the campaign]] all competitions comprised (five goals, 3,515 minutes of action), as both team and player won their third consecutive league championship.

===Monaco===
On 24 May 2013, it was announced that Moutinho had joined [[AS Monaco FC]] alongside teammate [[James Rodríguez]] for a combined fee believed to be around €70 million (€25 million for Moutinho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4398/transfer-zone/2013/05/24/4001585/breaking-news-moutinho-rodriguez-sign-for-monaco|title=Monaco pay €70 million for Porto pair|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his official debut for his new club on 1 September, starting and setting up both goals in a 2–1 win at [[Olympique de Marseille]] which put Monaco to the top of [[Ligue 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/289919/report|title=Riviere confirms Monaco win|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moutinho was first-choice in [[2013–14 Ligue 1|his debut campaign]], as the principality team finished runners-up straight out of [[Ligue 2]]. His only goal was an equaliser in a 1–1 away draw to [[Stade de Reims]], on 29 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/reims-vs-monaco/1479123/live-commentary?ICID=MP_MS_3|title=Reims 1–1 Monaco|publisher=Goal|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2014, in Monaco's [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|first Champions League match]] since 2005, Moutinho scored the only goal in a home defeat of [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/monaco-vs-bayer-leverkusen/1923551/report|title=Monaco 1–0 Bayer Leverkusen: Moutinho marks winning return for Monaco|publisher=Goal|last1=McGee|first1=Nicholas|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished [[2014–15 Ligue 1|the season]] with 52 overall appearances, in an eventual third-place finish for the [[Leonardo Jardim]]-led side.

Moutinho contributed with two goals from 31 matches during [[2016–17 Ligue 1|2016–17]], helping the club to the eighth national championship of its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.francefootball.fr/news/Ligue-1-le-huitieme-titre-de-champion-de-france-de-monaco-passe-au-crible/802096|title=Ligue 1: le huitième titre de champion de France de Monaco passé au crible|trans-title=Ligue 1: Monaco's eighth French champions title under the magnifying glass|publisher=[[France Football]]|language=fr|date=17 May 2017|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

==Career==
===Early career===
Vinagre began his career in the academy system of [[Sporting CP]] before joining [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in summer 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ASM Foot|url=https://www.asmfoot.fr/breve-22511-Transferts-L-ASM-aurait-recrute-un-Portugais-de-16-ans.html|title=L'ASM aurait recruté un Portugais de 16 ans|date=12 June 2015|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending his first season solely in the club's youth side, he signed a professional contract in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=AS Monaco |url=http://www.asmonaco.com/en/article/bongiovanni-and-vinagre-sign-professional-terms-70757.html|title=Bongiovanni and Vinagre sign professional terms|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2016, Vinagre featured in five matches of the [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portuguese under-17 national team]]'s success at the [[2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|UEFA European Championship]] in Azerbaijan, where they won the tournament after defeating Spain on penalties in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=UEFA |url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/season=2016/teams/player=250089224/index.html|title=Under 17 - Rúben Vinagre|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, a deal was agreed for Vinagre to be loaned to [[LigaPro|Portuguese Second Division]] side [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica de Coimbra]] to gain experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Académica de Coimbra|url=http://www.academica-oaf.pt/noticias/futebol-profissional/6281-2016-08-31-21-41-08/l|title=Rúben Vinagre e Ernest reforçam Académica|date=31 August 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but [[FIFA]], whose approval was required due to the player being under age 18, refused to sanction the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Record|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/2--liga/academica/detalhe/fifa-rejeita-ruben-vinagre.html|title=FIFA rejeita Rúben Vinagre|date=16 November 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an unsuccessful appeal, Vinagre returned to his parent club in January 2017 without making any appearances for Académica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Record|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/2--liga/academica/detalhe/ruben-vinagre-regressa-ao-monaco-ja-em-janeiro.html|title=Rúben Vinagre regressa ao Monaco já em Janeiro|date=13 December 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William James Norris''' (born 12 August 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

==Club career==
===Royston Town===
Without a club at the start of the 2011–12 season, Norris made an approach to join Hertfordshire side [[Royston Town F.C.|Royston Town]] who in the previous season had narrowly missed out on promotion after finishing 3rd in the [[Spartan South Midlands Football League|Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division]]. He played a number of games for the reserve team where his performances caught the attention of then first team manager, Paul Attfield, who pulled him into the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Norris: How an approach to Royston led to Cambridge United chance|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Norris-approach-Royston-led-Cambridge-United/story-28616792-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2011, he made his debut for Royston in a 4–1 home win against [[Haringey Borough F.C.|Haringey Borough]] in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match Report:Royston Town v Haringey Borough|url=http://www.roystontownfc.co.uk/match-reports/match-report-royston-town-v-haringey-borough-2/|publisher=[[Royston Town FC|roystontownfc.co.uk]]|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris went on to make 41 appearances in all competitions in 2011–12 helping the club to secure the Spartan South Midlands Premier Division title and a cup double which included the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup and the South Midlands Floodlit Cup. In the quarter final of the [[Cambridgeshire Invitation Cup]] against [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]] on 25 January 2012, the game was decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] in which Norris pulled off a number of saves in [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] before scoring the winning penalty to send Royston into the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norris heroics send Crows into semis|url=http://www.royston-crow.co.uk/sport/royston-town-fc/norris_heroics_send_crows_into_semis_1_1189960|publisher=[[Royston Crow (newspaper)|Royston Crow]]|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norris the hero for Royston|url=http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Norris-hero-Royston/story-21996134-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Hertfordshire Mercury]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leander Dendoncker''' (born 15 April 1995) is a [[Belgium national football team|Belgian international]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as either a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] or [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], for [[Premier League]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on loan from [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].

He joined Anderlecht in 2009 and made his professional debut in July 2013, going on to play 171 games for the club and score 11 goals. He won two [[Belgian Super Cup]]s and a [[Belgian First Division A]] title. He made his senior international debut for Belgium in June 2015 and was part of their squad that finished third at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
Dendoncker transferred from [[K.S.V. Roeselare]] to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] in 2009, choosing that club ahead of [[Standard Liège]], [[Club Brugge]] and [[K.R.C. Genk]].&lt;ref name=DH/&gt; After performances for the youth team in the [[NextGen Series (2011–13)|NextGen Series]] and a training camp in Turkey, he was incorporated into the first team in January 2013.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt; He models his game on that of the Spanish midfielder [[Sergio Busquets]].&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;

He made his professional debut on 21 July in the [[2013 Belgian Super Cup]], replacing [[Dennis Praet]] for the final nine minutes of the 1–0 win over Genk at the [[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]].&lt;ref name=super&gt;{{cite news |title=Anderlecht bat Genk et remporte sa 11e Supercoupe|trans-title=Anderlecht beat Genk 1&amp;ndash;0 and win their 11th Super Cup |url=https://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20130721_002 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |work=L'Avenir |date=21 July 2013 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September, he extended his contract until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dendoncker prolonge à Anderlecht jusqu'en 2016 |trans-title=Dendoncker prolongs at Anderlecht until 2016|url=https://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/belgique/jupilerproleague/detail_dendoncker-prolonge-a-anderlecht-jusqu-en-2016?id=8099369 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=RTBF |date=26 September 2013 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until 1 August 2014 that he debuted in the [[Belgian Pro League]], on the first day of the season away to [[KV Oostende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dendoncker: "Les voilà enfin, mes premiers buts!"|trans-title=Dendoncker: "Finally, my first goals!" |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/division-1a/anderlecht/dendoncker-les-voila-enfin-mes-premiers-buts-video-585709c2cd701e2eb2882f13 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=DH |date=19 December 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring his first professional goal on 18 January 2015 in a 3–0 win at [[Lierse S.K.]], Dendoncker was praised by former Anderlecht player [[Paul Van Himst]], who said that there was no better player at his position in the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Himst : "A Anderlecht, personne n'est meilleur que Dendoncker en n°6" |trans-title=Van Himst: "At Anderlecht, nobody is better at #6 than Dendoncker|url=https://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/belgique/jupilerproleague/detail_van-himst-a-anderlecht-personne-n-est-meilleur-que-dendoncker-en-n-6?id=8811528 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=RTBF |date=20 January 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played six matches in the [[2014–15 Belgian Cup]], which his team lost 2–1 in the final to Brugge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anderlecht repris de volée par Bruges en finale de la Coupe |url=https://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/belgique/coupe/detail_fc-bruges-anderlecht-une-finale-au-sommet-live-18h?id=8937619 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=RTBF |date=22 March 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderlecht won the [[2016–17 Belgian First Division A]].&lt;ref name=uefa/&gt; Dendoncker scored five goals along the way, including two on 18 December in a 4–0 home win over [[K.A.S. Eupen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dendoncker, auteur d'un doublé contre Eupen : "Je savais que j'allais marquer" |trans-title=Dendoncker, author of a brace against Eupen: "I knew I was going to score"|url=https://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/belgique/jupilerproleague/detail_dendoncker-auteur-d-un-double-contre-eupen-je-savais-que-j-allais-marquer?id=9484538 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=RTBF |date=18 December 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played all 16 games in their European campaign that season, which ended with elimination by eventual winners [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In the first leg of that tie on 13 April 2017, he scored a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leander Dendoncker strikes late to deny Red Devils away victory in Europa League |url=https://talksport.com/football/219614/anderlecht-1-1-manchester-united-leander-dendoncker-strikes-late-deny-red-devils-away/ |accessdate=11 July 2018 |publisher=Talksport |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2018 Dendoncker moved to newly promoted English [[Premier League]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on an initial season-long loan which is to become permanent in summer 2019.&lt;ref name="Wolves"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves land Belgium unternational Dendoncker |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20180809-wolves-land-belgium-international-dendoncker/ |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 28 August in the second round of the [[EFL Cup]] away to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] (2–0 victory), with coach [[Nuno Espírito Santo]] making nine changes from the previous game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheffield Wednesday 0&amp;ndash;2 Wolverhampton Wanderers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45254598 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September, [[The Football Association]] rejected the obligatory purchase clause in Dendoncker's Wolves contract and made his deal became permanent for €15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taildeman |first1=Yves |title=Leander Dendoncker déjà vendu pour 15 millions |trans-title=Leander Dendoncker already sold for 15 million|url=http://www.lalibre.be/sports/football/leander-dendoncker-deja-vendu-pour-15-millions-5ba5e794cd70a16d80fb054b |accessdate=22 September 2018 |work=La Libre |date=22 September 2018 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was part of Wolves' pre-season preparations for the 2016–17 campaign (scoring twice),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Great experience for Ennis|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C| url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/2016720-great-experience-for-ennis/| date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not make a first team appearance during the season proper after suffering another fibula fracture in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Wolves youngster Niall Ennis suffers broken leg|publisher=Express &amp; Star| url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2016/11/28/wolves-youngster-niall-ennis-suffers-broken-leg/| date=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Cruzeiro===
Born in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Minas Gerais]], Bonatini joined [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]]'s youth setup in 2010, aged 16. In July 2012 he was loaned to Italian [[Serie A]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for one season, with a buyout clause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otempo.com.br/superfc/futebol/pai-de-l%C3%A9o-bonatini-afirma-que-falta-de-proposta-formal-e-plano-de-carreira-tiraram-jogador-do-cruzeiro-1.196863 Pai de Léo Bonatini afirma que falta de proposta formal e plano de carreira tiraram jogador do Cruzeiro (Léo Bonatini's father states that lack of formal bid and career plan take the player out of Cruzeiro)]; O Tempo, 13 July 2012 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonatini only appeared for the club's ''Primavera'' squad, and subsequently returned to Cruzeiro in the 2013 summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/cruzeiro/noticia/2013/07/juventus-nao-exerce-direito-de-compra-e-leo-bonatini-volta-toca-ii.html Juventus não exerce direito de compra, e Léo Bonatini volta à Toca II (Juventus does not activate the buyout rights, and Léo Bonatini returns to ''Toca II'')]; Globo Esporte, 5 July 2013 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2013 he moved to [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]], also in a temporary deal until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goiasec.com.br/interativo/goias-contrata-leo-bonatini-por-emprestimo/noticia Goiás contrata Léo Bonatini por empréstimo (Goiás signs Léo Bonatini on loan)]; Goiás' official website, 2 October 2013 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonatini made his professional – and [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] – debut on 27 October, coming on as a second-half [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 2–0 away win against [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe|Náutico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2013/27-10-2013/nautico-goias.html Goiás derrota o lanterna Náutico na Arena PE e fica mais próximo do G-4 (Goiás defeats dead last Náutico at ''Arena PE'' and draws near to ''G-4'')]; Globo Esporte, 27 October 2013 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in five further matches for ''Esmeraldino'' during [[2013 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|the campaign]], and had his loan contract renewed for a further year on 7 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futebolgoiano.com.br/site/?p=6668 Goiás renova o empréstimo do atacante Léo Bonatini (Goiás renews the loan of forward Léo Bonatini)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127163514/http://www.futebolgoiano.com.br/site/?p=6668 |date=2016-01-27 }}; Futebol Goiano, 7 January 2014 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2014, Bonatini's loan was cut short, due to the lack of opportunities in the main squad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goiasec.com.br/interativo/atacante-leo-bonatini-e-zagueiro-wallinson-deixam-o-goias/noticia Atacante Léo Bonatini e zagueiro Wallinson deixam o Goiás (Forward Léo Bonatini and stopper Wallinson leave Goiás)]; Goiás' official website, 5 August 2014 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estoril===
On 5 January 2015, he was loaned to [[Primeira Liga]] side [[G.D.

On 13 July 2015, Bonatini had 50% of his federative rights sold to [[Traffic Group]], remaining at Estoril permanently. On 27 February 2016, he scored a [[hat-trick]] in a 3–0 home win against [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Estoril vence Vit.

===Al-Hilal===
On 16 July 2016, Bonatini joined Saudi club [[Al-Hilal FC|Al-Hilal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Hilal anuncia Bonatini (Al-Hilal announces Bonatini)|url=http://abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=622041|website=A Bola|accessdate=16 July 2016}}{{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Saudi Professional League]] in his only season in [[Riyadh]], with him and compatriot [[Carlos Eduardo de Oliveira Alves|Carlos Eduardo]] scoring 12 goals each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Léo Bonatini e Carlos Eduardo são campeões da Arábia Saudita|trans-title=Léo Bonatini and Carlos Eduardo are champions of Saudi Arabia |url=https://tvi24.iol.pt/internacional/al-hilal/leo-bonatini-e-carlos-eduardo-sao-campeoes-da-arabia-saudita |accessdate=6 February 2019 |publisher=TVI 24 |date=20 April 2017 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also won the [[2017 King Cup]], and Bonatini scored twice in the 3–2 win over [[Al-Wehda Club (Mecca)|Al-Wehda]] in the last 16 at the [[Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Complacent Al Hilal edge past Al Wahda in Saudi King's Cup |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/complacent-al-hilal-edge-past-al-wahda-in-saudi-king-cup/1rssf28ddytyx101t9brg094je |accessdate=6 February 2019 |publisher=Sporting News |date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 1 August 2017, Bonatini was sent on a season-long loan to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20170801-bonatini-checks-in/|title=Bonatini checks in! |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he made his debut, and scored his first goal, in a 1–0 win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] at [[Molineux Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40760787|title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 Middlesbrough|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his 10th goal of the season on 3 November 2017 in a 2–0 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], scoring in six consecutive games, becoming the first player of the [[2017–18 EFL Championship]] season to reach double figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41772120|title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–0 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2017, after scoring 5 goals in 4 games during the October fixtures, he was awarded with the [[EFL Championship Player of the Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Player of the Month: Léo Bonatini – Wolverhampton Wanderers|url=https://www.efl.com/news/2017/november/player-of-the-month-leo-bonatini---wolverhampton-wanderers/ |publisher=EFL.com |date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite scoring his last goal of the season on 4 December 2017, Bonatini finished as Wolves' second top scorer with 12 goals in 43 games as the club gained promotion to the [[Premier League]], as well as winning the Championship league title.&lt;ref name="End of season"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves Sign Bonatini And Vinagre |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20180630-wolves-sign-bonatini-and-vinagre/ |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2018, he joined Wolves on a permanent deal, signing a four-year-contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="End of season"/&gt; However, he took little part in their top-flight campaign, having fallen behind other strikers such as [[Raúl Jiménez]] at [[Nuno Espírito Santo]]'s club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Husband |first1=Ben |title='A Poundland Jimenez' - it's time for this Wolves transfer to happen |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-wwfc-transfer-leo-bonatini-15746742 |accessdate=6 February 2019 |work=Birmingham Mail |date=29 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sylvain Boris Nabil Deslandes''' (born 25 April 1997) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Segunda División B]] club [[FC Jumilla]] on loan from English club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He has represented France at under-16 through under-20 level.

==Career==
Deslandes moved upon the expiry of his contract with French club [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] to join English side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in July 2015, agreeing a two-year deal (with the option of a third year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Deslandes set to sign| publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C| url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/deslandes-set-to-sign-2487827.aspx| date=10 June 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906133926/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/deslandes-set-to-sign-2487827.aspx| archivedate=6 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his club debut on 25 August 2015 in a League Cup win over [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Wolves 2–1 Barnet|publisher=BBC Sport| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33969991| date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2017, he joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buryfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/confirmed-left-back-deslandes-arrives-from-wolves-3548768.aspx|title=Confirmed: Left Back Deslandes arrives from Wolves|publisher=Bury F.C.|date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He returned to Wolves at the end of the 2016–17 season having made no appearances for Bury.

He appeared regularly under [[Nuno Espírito Santo]] in 2017–18 pre-season and played 90 minutes in the 2–0 [[EFL Cup|Carabao Cup]] win against [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2017/09/19/wolves-defender-deslandes-loving-being-in-land-of-sylvain/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also came on during Wolves' 2–1 [[EFL Championship|Championship]] victory against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2017/09/19/wolves-defender-deslandes-loving-being-in-land-of-sylvain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2018, he agreed to join [[Portsmouth F.C.]] as a [[left-back]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20180102-ronan-and-deslandes-leave-on-loan/|title=Ronan And Deslandes Leave On Loan|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He returned to Wolves at the end of the season having made only two appearances for Portsmouth, after manager [[Kenny Jackett]] had said his future was not at [[left-back]] but [[centre-back]] as Deslandes was a player with "power" and "athleticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/pompey/pompey-boss-deslandes-future-not-at-left-back-1-8491835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Johnson started his youth career with the academy of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and later joined the academy of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton]]. While progressing through the youth ranks, he went on to captain the under-23 team. He signed his first professional contract with the club at the beginning of the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet The Under 23s |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/under-23/20170505-meet-the-under-23s/ |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |accessdate=7 September 2018 |date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a product of the [[Aston Villa Under-21s and Academy|Aston Villa Academy]], having spent twelve years there as a junior.

==Career==
Graham is a product of the Aston Villa youth academy and was a member of their [[NextGen Series]] winning side in the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref name=nextgen/&gt; He signed a professional contract with Villa in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2634177,00.html| title=Academy starlet Graham signs professional contract| publisher=Aston Villa F.C|date= 7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, he joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on loan, where he made his professional debut on 7 December 2013 in a 2–1 win over [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25163687 | title = Ipswich 2–1 Huddersfield | publisher = BBC Sport| date = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also made an appearance in the victory over [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] before he returned to Villa at the end of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/ipswich-town-news/24305? | title= Loanee Returns to Villa | publisher=Ipswich Town F.C | date = 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2014, he joined League One side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on a one-month loan deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Graham comes to city |url=http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/graham-joins-city-1285252.aspx |publisher=Bradford City AFC |date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom he made one appearance: against his future club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 1 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25891950| title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–0 Bradford City| publisher=BBC Sport| date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winger joined Wolverhampton Wanderers, now returned to the Championship, in November 2014 on loan until the January transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30238820| title =Aston Villa: Wolves sign midfielder Jordan Graham on loan| publisher = BBC Sport| date =27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injury prevented him from making any appearances during this loan period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/jordan-graham-completes-move-2182698.aspx| title=Jordan Graham completes move| publisher = Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C | date = 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he signed a permanent 18-month deal with the club on 5 January 2015 for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30682931| title=Jordan Graham completes move| publisher =BBC Sport| date = 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to make a first-team appearance for Wolves, he was sent on a month-long loan to League Two side [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Oxford United: Winger Jordan Graham set to join on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34381097|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a successful initial month, his loan was extended by two months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34621656 |title=Jordan Graham: Winger extends Oxford loan by two months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a few days later he was recalled by Wolves after an injury crisis at his parent club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oufc.co.uk/news/article/oxford-united-wolves-jordan-graham-2767506.aspx |title=Winger Graham Returns To Wolves |publisher=Oxford United F.C. |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham scored his first goal in his club career for Wolverhampton Wanderers on 28 December 2015 in the 52nd minute of a Championship game against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at The Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35147801 |title=Charlton Athletic 0 Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered torn knee ligaments during a game against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 16 January 2016. Despite this, Graham extended his contract with Wolves until the end of the 2017–18 season, with the club having the option of two additional years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35533293| publisher=BBC Sport| title=Wolves: Jordan Graham and Kortney Hause extend contracts|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial prognosis of his injury was that he was expected to be missing from action for between nine and 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35343431 |title=Jordan Graham: Wolves winger out for nine months with injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after suffering several setbacks during his recovery, he did not return to first-team football until 15 months later, on 25 April 2017, in a 1–0 defeat against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield]] at Molineux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39035260| publisher=BBC Sport| title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 0–1 Huddersfield Town|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michał Żyro''' (&lt;small&gt;Polish pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-pl|'|m|i|ch|a|ł|-|'|ż|y|r|o}}; born 20 September 1992 in [[Warsaw]], Poland) is a Polish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Pogon Szczecin]] on loan from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He has previously represented [[Legia Warsaw]] and spent time on loan at English [[EFL League One|League One]] side Charlton Athletic.

==Club career==
Żyro spent five years playing in KS Piaseczno as a youth team player before joining the youth academy at [[Legia Warsaw]] at the age of 13. When he was 17, Żyro was promoted to the senior team and ultimately the first team squad. He spent six years in the senior team scoring 13 goals in 96 matches.

On 24 December, he signed a three-and-a-half year contract with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michal Zyro: Wolves sign Legia Warsaw winger|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35177291|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the club officially when the transfer window re-opened on 2 January.

He made his debut for Wolverhampton Wanderers on 9 January 2016 in an FA Cup tie against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. On 12 January 2016, he scored his first goals for the club on his home and league debut, scoring twice in a 3–2 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michal Zyro nets double on home debut as in-form Wolves down Fulham|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/michal-zyro-nets-double-on-home-debut-as-in-form-wolves-down-fulham_sto5057400/story.shtml|publisher=Eurosport|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Żyro scored his third goal for Wolves in a 1–3 loss against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35269833&lt;/ref&gt; shortly afterwards, he suffered a calf injury, putting him out of the game for up to six weeks. On 6 April, shortly after returning from injury, Żyro was on the receiving end of a reckless challenge from [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] defender [[Antony Kay]], causing multiple ligament damage and a fracture in his knee, ruling him out for up to 16 months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2016/01/25/breaking-news-wolves-dave-edwards-and-michal-zyro-facing-long-injury-layoffs/&lt;/ref&gt; He finally made his return to competitive football almost 17 months later, on 23 August 2017 as a substitute in a 2–0 away win against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the [[EFL Cup|Carabao Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Southampton 0–2 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40944673| date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2018 he joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=DONE DEAL : Charlton sign Polish striker on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers|publisher=Charlton Athletic official website| url=https://www.cafc.co.uk/news/view/5a6623830c10b/done-deal-charlton-sign-polish-striker-on-loan-from-wolverhampton-wanderers| date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2018 he joined [[Pogoń Szczecin]] on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Michał Żyro w Pogoni|publisher=90minut.pl| url=http://www.90minut.pl/news/289/news2895532-Michal-Zyro-w-Pogoni.html| date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
