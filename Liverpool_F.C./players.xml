====2014–15 season====
[[File:Virgil van Dijk 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Dijk playing for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 2015]]

On 22 July 2014, Van Dijk and [[Teemu Pukki]] each scored twice in a 4–0 home win over [[Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur|KR]] in a [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifier, putting their team into the next round 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Burrows |title=Celtic 4–0 KR Reykjavik: Hoops ease into next Champions League round in comfortable fashion |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/celtic-4-0-kr-reykjavik-hoops-3897700 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=22 July 2014 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal of the [[2014–15 Scottish Premiership|Premiership season]] came on 9 November, finishing from [[Stefan Johansen]]'s last-minute corner for a 2–1 win at Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Moffat |title=Aberdeen 1–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868766 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Van Dijk scored the first and last goals of Celtic's 4–0 win versus [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] in the fourth round of the [[Scottish Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Southwick |title=Heart of Midlothian 0–4 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30166217 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after that, his sixth goal of the season was enough for victory in a home match against [[Glasgow]] neighbours [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Celtic 1–0 Partick Thistle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28647040 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Dijk was again on target on 21 January 2015, opening a 4–0 home win over [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Moffat |title=Celtic 4–0 Motherwell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30808448 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February, he was sent off in the 36th minute against [[Inter Milan]] for a foul on [[Mauro Icardi]], as Celtic lost 1–0 on the night, 4–3 on aggregate in the last 32 of the [[UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Swan |title=Inter 1 Celtic 0 (4–3 agg): Late strike finishes off battling ten-man Celtic and ends their Europa League run |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-match-reports/inter-1-celtic-0-4-3-5239236 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=26 February 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again sent off on 8 March in the Cup quarter-final away to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Tannadice Park]], receiving a red card after eleven minutes for a confrontation with [[Calum Butcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keir |last=Murray |title=Dundee United 1–1 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31680308 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suspension for the following week's [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final|Scottish League Cup Final]] was overturned on appeal, as was that of [[Paul Paton]], who was sent off when mistaken for Butcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Dijk and Paton cleared to play in League Cup final |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31858622 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dijk played the full 90 minutes of the final at [[Hampden Park]], which Celtic won 2–0.&lt;ref name=2015SLC&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Dundee United 0–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31785677 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March, Celtic's third consecutive match against Dundee United, Van Dijk scored in the last minute to confirm a 4–0 win in a Cup replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtic 4–0 Dundee United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31826157 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April, Celtic contested the Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden, and Van Dijk opened the scoring with a free kick. After the dismissal of goalkeeper [[Craig Gordon]], Celtic fell 3–2, ending their chance of a [[Treble (association football)|treble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |title=Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089585 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, again from a free kick, he confirmed a 2–1 win away to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Southwick |title=Celtic 1–2 Dundee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31827990 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team again won the league, and Van Dijk was included in the league's Team of the Season for the second consecutive campaign.&lt;ref name=1415PFA&gt;{{cite news |first=Gregor |last=Kyle |title=The SPFL dream team: PFA Scotland announce their teams of the year |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spfl-dream-team-pfa-scotland-5616035 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Dijk was reportedly "considering his future" in Glasgow after Celtic were knocked out of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]] in the qualifying rounds to [[Malmö FF|Malmö]] of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virgil van Dijk: Celtic defender considers future after defeat |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34060123 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Van Dijk made his full international debut for [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 10 October 2015, in a 2–1 victory away from home against [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Successful Saturday for Saints stars |url=https://southamptonfc.com/news/2015-10-10/successful-saturday-for-saints-stars |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[captain (association football)|captain]]cy of his country by manager [[Ronald Koeman]] on 22 March 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Dijk named new Netherlands captain |first=Daniel |last=Karell |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=22 March 2018 |work=soccer.nbcsports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |url=http://soccer.nbcsports.com/2018/03/22/van-dijk-named-new-netherlands-captain/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first match as captain was a 1–0 home friendly defeat by [[England national football team|England]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Netherlands 0–1 England |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=23 March 2018 |accessdate=24 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43380175}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March, he scored his first international goal to conclude a 3–0 win over European champions [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] at the [[Stade de Genève]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soccer – Portugal suffer first-half collapse in 3–0 loss to Dutch |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-friendly-por-ned/soccer-portugal-suffer-first-half-collapse-in-3-0-loss-to-dutch-idUKKBN1H22S7 |accessdate=26 March 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, he scored in a 3–0 win over [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45851123 |title=Netherlands 3–0 Germany: Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum score for hosts |date=13 October 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Van Dijk is a right-footed [[centre back]], who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although he can also play as a right-sided centre back.&lt;ref name=NMcG&gt;{{cite news |title=Virgil van Dijk 'can be a great' as Liverpool agree to pay £75m for defender |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40730793 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 December 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called him "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the ideal central defender", praising him as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong leadership qualities", while commenting that since his move to England, he is "more tactically aware now [...] his anticipation and timing has improved and he is a lot more of an all-rounder".&lt;ref name=NMcG/&gt; McGuinness believes Van Dijk's "biggest problem" is that he "can switch off when the game is comfortable".&lt;ref name=NMcG/&gt;

'''Georginio Gregion Emile Wijnaldum''' ({{IPA-nl|ɟɔrˈɟiɲoː ʋɛiˈnɑldʏm}}; born 11 November 1990) is a Dutch professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

A youth product of [[Eredivisie]] side [[Feyenoord]], Wijnaldum became the youngest player ever to represent the club when he made his debut in 2007, and went on to play 134 matches over the course of a five-year spell. Following his departure from Feyenoord, Wijnaldum spent four seasons at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] where he won the [[KNVB Cup]] in the first season and the Eredivisie in his last. He also earned the [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]] award during his time with PSV. In 2015, Wijnaldum joined Premier League side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £14.5&amp;nbsp;million, before departing following the club's relegation a year later to join Liverpool in a £23&amp;nbsp;million deal.

Wijnaldum is also a full Dutch international, having earned more than 50 caps since making his debut in 2011, and was a member of the squad which came third at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Wijnaldum was born and raised in [[Rotterdam]], [[South Holland]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know! |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/features/2011-03-02/liverpool-transfer-target-georginio-wijnaldum-10-things-you-need-know |newspaper=talksport.co.uk, [[Talksport]]|author=Sian Parry |language= |trans-title= |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was six years old, his parents, who are both of [[Afro-Surinamese]] descent, went through a divorce with the result that his mother moved to [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4389/ghana/2013/05/15/3980540/im-not-a-ghanaian-boateng-was-the-name-of-my-step-father|title='I'm not a Ghanaian; Boateng was the name of my step father,' PSV's Georginio Wijnaldum&amp;nbsp;– Goal.com|date=15 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wijnaldum decided to stay in Rotterdam and moved in with his grandmother, where he lived for the remainder of his childhood.&lt;ref name="10 things you need to know about Georginio Wijnaldum"&gt;{{cite news |title=10 things you need to know about Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-spy/Liverpool-target-Georginio-Wijnaldum-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-Dutch-midfielder-plus-watch-video-of-him-in-action-article385049.html |newspaper=mirrorfootball.co.uk, [[Daily Mirror]] |language= |trans-title= |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wijnaldum's younger years, he never showed interest in football. He never played with a ball or watched football on TV. His ambition was to become a gymnast or acrobat. This changed when Wijnaldum's cousin asked him to come to [[Sparta Rotterdam]]'s opening day with him; then he was invited to the Sparta Rotterdam youth academy and his love for football started to grow slowly.&lt;ref name=kameraadjes&gt;{{cite news |title=Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/content/asp/kameraadjes/website/feyenoord.asp?speler=10010000030408 |newspaper=Kameraadjes |language=Dutch |trans-title= |date= |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908122341/http://www.feyenoord.nl/content/asp/kameraadjes/website/feyenoord.asp?speler=10010000030408 |archivedate=8 September 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wijnaldum has two younger brothers, one of whom, [[Giliano Wijnaldum]], currently plays for Sparta Rotterdam, as well as a half-brother, [[Rajiv van La Parra]], who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/spotlight-on-georginio-wijnaldum-newcastles-new-dutch-delight/|title=Spotlight on Georginio Wijnaldum: Newcastle's new Dutch delight&amp;nbsp;– Football Oranje|date=12 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wijnaldum was formerly known as Georginio Boateng, but following his mother's divorce, he took her maiden name (Wijnaldum).&lt;ref name="ad"&gt;{{cite news |title='Goed ventje' laat zich niet gek maken |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1046/Eredivisie/article/detail/344867/2008/11/07/Goed-ventje-laat-zich-niet-gek-maken.dhtml |newspaper=AD |language=Dutch |trans-title='Good boy' won't be caught with his head in the clouds |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
At age six, Wijnaldum developed himself rapidly at Sparta Rotterdam, winning two championship titles in his first two seasons. Soon [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]] showed interest in the youngster, but Wijnaldum declined all offers: "I didn't watch football on TV and I didn't know any of the first team players of Sparta or any of the top clubs. I only knew the real famous players of ''Oranje'', so the offers didn't impress me much. I had a good time at Sparta, I wanted to stay." After playing for Sparta Rotterdam for seven seasons and representing the Netherlands at various youth levels, Wijnaldum decided to accept a new Feyenoord offer. He was convinced playing for Feyenoord was better for his development as a football player and believed in Feyenoord's vision.&lt;ref name="kameraadjes"/&gt;

At Feyenoord, Wijnaldum joined a successful generation with the likes of [[Leroy Fer]] and [[Luís Pedro]]. Wijnaldum stood out as an exceptional talent. In January 2007, a few weeks after turning 16, Wijnaldum was invited to the first team's training camp in [[Belek]], Turkey, by Feyenoord manager [[Erwin Koeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Talent in Turkije (4): Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20070112Wijnaldum.aspx |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Talent in Turkey (4): Georginio Wijnaldum |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002142801/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20070112Wijnaldum.aspx |archive-date=2 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feyenoord===
[[File:Georginio Wijnaldum 001.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Wijnaldum with [[Feyenoord]] in 2007.]]
On 8 April 2007, Wijnaldum made his official debut in Feyenoord's starting line-up in the [[Eredivisie]] home match against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] (0–4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mokerslag in de Kuip: 0–4 |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000010179 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144350/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000010179 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2012 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Slam dunk in de Kuip: 0–4 |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16 and 148 days, Wijnaldum became the youngest player ever to play in Feyenoord's first team and was chosen Feyenoord's man of the match. On 2 December 2007, Wijnaldum scored his first Eredivisie goal for Feyenoord, against [[Heracles Almelo]] in a 6–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swingend en glibberend voorbij Heracles: 6–0 |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000030681 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Swinging and slipping past Heracles: 6–0 |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002434/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000030681 |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008–09 season, Wijnaldum made his official European debut. On 18 September 2008, he was named in the starting line-up in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] [[2008–09 UEFA Cup first round|home match]] against [[Kalmar FF]] (0–1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teleurstellende rentree op Europees podium |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032667 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Disappointing comeback on European stage |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308064933/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032667 |archivedate=8 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2008, he scored his first European goal for Feyenoord in the return match against Kalmar FF, which resulted in a 1–2 win and a place in the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup group stage|competition's group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feyenoord naar groepsfase UEFA Cup |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032668 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Feyenoord to group stage UEFA Cup |date=2 October 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144409/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032668 |archivedate=13 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2009, Wijnaldum signed a new contract at Feyenoord which would have kept him at [[De Kuip]] until summer 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feyenoord verlengt contract Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20090306_wijnaldum.aspx |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Feyenoord renews contract Wijnaldum |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144510/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20090306_wijnaldum.aspx |archive-date=13 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2011, he helped his struggling Feyenoord to a 5–1 demolition of Groningen, scoring four goals. He scored two goals from open play in the first half and two more from the penalty spot to add his total for [[2010–11 Eredivisie|the season]] to eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/295507?cc=5901 Match: Feyenoord Rotterdam v FC Groningen&amp;nbsp;– Dutch Eredivisie&amp;nbsp;– ESPN FC].

===PSV===
[[File:Dinamo-PSV (7).jpg|thumb|272x272px|Wijnaldum with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in 2014.]]
On 29 June 2011, the technical director of Feyenoord announced the club had reached a transfer deal for Wijnaldum reported to be worth €5&amp;nbsp;million with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=141028 'Ik had Wijnaldum liever aan buitenlandse club verkocht']. Voetbalzone.nl. Retrieved on 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 Eredivisie season]], Wijnaldum made his debut for PSV in a 3–1 loss against [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: AZ Alkmaar vs PSV Eindhoven|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=321917&amp;cc=5739|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 2011, Wijnaldum scored his first goal for PSV in a 3–0 victory against [[ADO Den Haag]]. Since joining the club, Wijnaldum established himself in the starting 11 as he scored goals and developed assists from his attacking role in midfield in Eredivisie, the KNVB Cup and the UEFA Europa League. After the retirement of [[Mark van Bommel]] and the departure of [[Kevin Strootman]] in the summer of 2013, Wijnaldum was named PSV's captain for the [[2013–14 Eredivisie]] season. However, he played just 11 matches that year, scoring four goals, due to a back injury.

'''Dejan Lovren''' ({{IPA-sh|dějan lǒʋren|hr}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=f1lhXhQ%3D&amp;keyword=Dejan|title=Dèjan|quote=Dèjan|website=Hrvatski jezični portal|accessdate=17 March 2018|language=sh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=e15hWxQ%3D&amp;keyword=Sv. |title=Lóvro| quote=Lòvren| website=Hrvatski jezični portal|accessdate=17 March 2018|language=sh}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 5 July 1989) is a Croatian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Croatia national football team|Croatia national team]].

Lovren began his career at [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] before moving to [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in January 2010. He spent three-and-a-half seasons with the [[Ligue 1]] team and won the 2012 [[Coupe de France]] before he signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2013. After one season with Southampton, he joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for £20&amp;nbsp;million and has since made over 150 appearances for the club.

Having previously represented Croatia at various youth levels, he made his senior debut in 2009 and has since gone on to make over 40 appearances for his country. He was selected in Croatia's squads for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, the latter of which were beaten finalists against [[France national football team|France]].

==Early life==
Lovren was born to [[Croats|Croatian]] parents in the city of [[Zenica]], SFR Yugoslavia (now Bosnia and Herzegovina).&lt;ref name="LFC profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dejan Lovren Player Profile|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/1275|publisher=LFC History|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family fled from Yugoslavia to [[Munich]] to escape the [[Bosnian War]] when Lovren was three years old, and he spent the next seven years in Germany. Speaking about his time as a refugee, Lovren stated that he was "a happy boy, I spoke [[German language|German]] perfectly, I went to school, I played for a little club."{{cn|date=February 2019}}

His family eventually had to leave as they did not possess necessary documentation to reside in Germany and settled in [[Karlovac]], Croatia, 50 kilometres southwest of the capital city of [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="gard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Paul|title=Dejan Lovren puts traumas behind him to enjoy Southampton high life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/30/dejan-lovren-southampton-croatia-chelsea|work=The Guardian|date=30 November 2013|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovren initially found settling in Croatia difficult, and struggled in school for a couple of years due to his unfamiliarity with the [[Croatian language]].&lt;ref name="gard" /&gt; His younger brother [[Davor Lovren|Davor]] is also a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/26/liverpool-identify-dejan-lovrens-brother-davor-as-possible-transfer-target-report-5463030/|title=Liverpool identify Dejan Lovren's brother Davor as possible transfer target|first=Mark|last=Brus|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Dinamo Zagreb===
Lovren first played football in Germany with Munich-based [[BSC Sendling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dejan Lovren: Vom BSC Sendling ins WM-Halbfinale  (From  BSC Sendling to the World Cup semi-final) |url=https://www.fupa.net/berichte/bsc-sendling-muenchen-dejan-lovren-vom-bsc-sendling-ins-wm-h-2108278.html |website=www.fupa.net |accessdate=29 August 2018 |language=German |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Croatia, he played for local teams NK Ilovac and [[NK Karlovac]] as a youth before joining [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb]] in 2004.

On 10 May 2006, he made his debut for Dinamo in a [[Croatian First Football League]] match against [[NK Varaždin|NK Varteks Varaždin]]. On 17 July 2006, Lovren was loaned to [[NK Inter Zaprešić]] for two seasons where he made 50 league appearances and scored one goal. Following his return from loan Lovren regularly featured in Dinamo's starting XI, appearing in 38 matches throughout the [[NK Dinamo Zagreb season 2008–09|2008–09 season]] and scoring three goals. In the [[NK Dinamo Zagreb season 2009–10|2009–10 season]], he featured in all four of Dinamo's [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifiers against [[Pyunik Yerevan]] and [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], and managed to score a header against Pyunik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dinamo pred praznim Maksimirom prošao dalje| url=http://sport.dnevnik.hr/clanak/champions_league/uzivo-dinamo-pyunik-0-0.html| publisher =Dnevnik| date=21 July 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009| language=Croatian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825183856/http://sport.dnevnik.hr/clanak/champions_league/uzivo-dinamo-pyunik-0-0.html|archivedate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyon===
[[File:Dejan Lovren.jpg|thumb|upright|Lovren playing for [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 2010]]

In January 2010, Lovren signed for French [[Ligue 1]] club [[Olympique Lyonnais]] for €8&amp;nbsp;million plus €1.5&amp;nbsp;million in incentives on a four-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference Document 2008/09 |url=http://www.actusnews.com/documents/ACTUS-0-3288-OL-DDR-0809-GB.pdf |work=Olympique Lyonnais |publisher=www.actusnews.com|accessdate=15 June 2013|page=101 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut on 24 January 2010 in their 2–1 defeat at [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in the [[Coupe de France]], playing the full match. His Ligue 1 debut came on 31 January in Lyon's 2–1 win at home against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], once again playing the full 90 minutes. During the second half of the season, he made 10 appearances, mostly as a substitute. He was not allowed to participate in Lyon's matches in the UEFA Champions League that season as he had already played in the competition for Dinamo Zagreb.

Lovren's playing time increased during the [[2010–11 Olympique Lyonnais season|2010–11 season]] following the departure of two other defenders, [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] and [[Mathieu Bodmer]], in the summer of 2010. During the season, he gradually established himself as a first team regular starter, playing as a centre-back alongside [[Cristiano Marques Gomes|Cris]] as well as being used as a right or left full-back, demonstrating himself as a versatile defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/support-inside-barcelona-lyon-defender-lovren-increasing-3422641|title=Support inside Barcelona for Lyon defender Lovren increasing|year=2012|work=tribalfootball.com|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 Lovren was listed in the ''[[Don Balón]]'' list of the 100 best young players in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Balon's list of the 100 best young players in the world|url=http://www.thespoiler.co.uk/2010/11/02/don-balons-list-of-the-100-best-young-players-in-the-world/|publisher=Don Balón|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2012, Lovren extended his contract with Lyon for two more seasons, signing with the French club until 2016. He started for Lyon in the [[2012 Coupe de France Final]], a 1–0 win over [[US Quevilly|Quevilly]], but was substituted after 18 minutes for [[Bakary Koné]].

===Southampton===
On 14 June 2013, Lovren signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saints Land Lovren|publisher=Southampton FC|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/saints-land-lovren-868792.aspx |accessdate=14 June 2013|date= 14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was estimated at £8.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson|first=Gordon|title=Saints make £8m swoop for defender |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/saints/news/10487269.Saints_make___8m_swoop/|date=14 June 2013|newspaper=Southampton Echo|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 17 August 2013, in a 1–0 win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Brom 0 – 1 Southampton| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644676| publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Southampton against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] on 21 September 2013, a goal which proved to be the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool 0 – 1 Southampton| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24089810|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, he assisted [[Adam Lallana]] for the equalising goal against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a 1–1 draw at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United 1 – 1 Southampton| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24503988| publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 October 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added a second league goal in a 2–2 away draw against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 18 January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunderland 2 – 2 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25693406|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 January 2014|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was stretchered off late in the game and required hospital treatment after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pochettino admits concern over Lovren and Ramirez injuries|url=http://www.goal.com/en-my/news/3890/england/2014/01/19/4553427/pochettino-admits-concern-over-lovren-and-ramirez-injuries|first=Harry|last=Slavin|publisher=Goal.com|date=19 January 2014|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January, it was announced that along with midfielder [[Gastón Ramírez]], Lovren would be out for six-to-eight weeks with ankle ligament damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaston Ramirez and Dejan Lovren out for up to eight weeks| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25848751| publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of his first season in the [[Premier League]], Lovren was named in [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg Sports]]' Power 50 list, which provides statistical rankings of performances from players in Europe's top five leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saints trio in Bloomberg Power 50|publisher=Southampton FC|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/22052014-fonte-lovren-lambert-bloomberg-power-50-1569451.aspx|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth-highest ranked player from the Premier League in 31st position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power 50 List|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg Sports]]|url=https://www.bsports.com/power50-list#.U4Dh6CqtNMU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525214140/https://www.bsports.com/power50-list#.U4Dh6CqtNMU|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2014|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much speculation regarding Lovren's future following the departures of [[Adam Lallana]], [[Luke Shaw]] and [[Rickie Lambert]] from Southampton, the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' reported on 25 July 2014 that Southampton had agreed a fee with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for the sale of Lovren, who was set to undergo a medical at the Merseyside club after reportedly handing in a transfer request at Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Liverpool FC agree £20m deal for Lovren|work=Liverpool Echo| url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-fc-agree-20m-deal-7509715|date=25 July 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
[[File:Dejan Lovren cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Lovren playing for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2014]]

On 27 July 2014, Lovren became the third Southampton player that transfer window to join Liverpool, after [[Rickie Lambert]] and [[Adam Lallana]]. He signed a four-year deal for a reported fee of £20&amp;nbsp;million, becoming the most expensive defender in Liverpool's history until [[Virgil van Dijk]] joined the club in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Liverpool sign Dejan Lovren from Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28492306| date=27 July 2014|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dejan Lovren seals Liverpool transfer|publisher=Liverpool Football Club| url= http://liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/167331-dejan-lovren-seals-liverpool-transfer|date=27 July 2014|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovren regained his place in the lineup for the first three games of the [[2015–16 Liverpool F.C. season|2015–16 season]] and performed well securing three clean sheets and seven points. However, following a pair of defeats to [[West Ham United]] and rivals [[Manchester United]] in which the defence conceded six goals, Lovren again lost his place to [[Mamadou Sakho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodgers Insists Sakho Remains in His Long-Term Plans |url=http://liverpooloffside.sbnation.com/liverpool-fc-news-coverage/2015/9/17/9344453/brendan-rodgers-mamadou-sakho-start-bordeaux-new-contract-lovren|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November he came on as a substitute for Sakho in a 2–1 defeat to [[Crystal Palace FC|Crystal Palace]] at [[Anfield]], with Sakho sustaining a knee injury that ruled him out for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho out six to eight weeks with knee injury|url=http://www.espnfc.com/liverpool/story/2709248/mamadou-sakho-out-six-eight-weeks-for-liverpool-knee-injury|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December, in a 2–2 draw against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], Lovren was stretchered off the pitch in the 79th minute due to injury and was replaced by [[Divock Origi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35055770 |title=Liverpool 0–0 West Brom |date=13 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate= 14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following 14 April, Lovren scored a stoppage-time winning goal in a 4–3 [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] quarter-final win over [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report|title=Liverpool's Dejan Lovren sinks Borussia Dortmund in stirring comeback|last=Hunter|first=Andy|date=14 April 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having endured a difficult start to his career at Liverpool, by the end of the 2015–16 season under [[Jürgen Klopp]], Lovren was described as having transformed into a "calm and composed" leader on the pitch by the ''Liverpool Echo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=James|title=Blood Red: Lovren's transformation epitomises Liverpool FC's progress under Klopp|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/blood-red-lovrens-transformation-epitomises-11297940|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2017, Lovren scored his first goal of the season in a 4–0 win over [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]; a result which saw Liverpool become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive away league matches by a margin of at least three goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/news/liverpool-make-history-with-away-game-goal-tally/12jskoyjq9br01o8rlni44sp02|title=Liverpool Make History with Record Away Goal Tally |publisher=Goal|last=Crawford|first=Stephen|date=17 December 2017|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Virgil van Dijk]]'s arrival on 1 January, he and Lovren built a steady partnership at the heart of Liverpool's defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-final-vandijk/van-dijk-has-made-me-a-better-player-says-liverpools-lovren-idUKKCN1IN301|title=van Dijk has made me a better player, says Liverpool's Lovren|publisher=Reuters|date=26 May 2018|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2018, Lovren captained Liverpool for the first time in a 4–3 win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first =Chris| last=Shaw | date= 14 January 2018 |url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/287374-lovren-being-liverpool-captain-was-an-honour| title=Lovren: Being Liverpool captain was an honour|publisher=Liverpool FC|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, Lovren scored his second goal of the season in a 4–0 win over [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]], which secured Liverpool's qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]] next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44020158| title=Liverpool 4–0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|date=13 May 2018| publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Dejan Lovren Croatia.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lovren with Croatia at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Lovren has made 54 appearances and scored six goals for various Croatian youth national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/?ln=hr&amp;w=statistike&amp;repka=U&amp;id=14746|title=Hrvatski nogometni savez|website=www.hns-cff.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first call–up to [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national team]] in August 2009 by manager [[Slaven Bilić]], who included the player in his match squad against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]]. Lovren was an unused substitute, but still was reportedly delighted with the new experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Novi reprezentativac spreman za "modre" izazove|url=http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/vijest/prikaz/1812/default.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816233706/http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/vijest/prikaz/1812/default.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 August 2009|publisher=NK Dinamo|date=14 August 2009|accessdate=6 September 2009|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] on 8 November 2009, coming on as a substitute for [[Danijel Pranjić]].

On 2 September 2011, Lovren scored his first international goal, against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] match. He was included by manager Slaven Bilić in the preliminary 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] but had to withdraw because of injury one week before the tournament.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Lovren scored his second goal for Croatia on 26 March 2013 in a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Liberty Stadium]] in [[Swansea]]. It was an equalizer that leveled the match after [[Gareth Bale]] had given Wales the lead from a penalty which Lovren conceded. Croatia eventually won the game 1–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovren izjednačio, Eduardo zabio za pobjedu!|url=http://gol.dnevnik.hr/clanak/nogomet/reprezentacije/hrvatska-u-walesu-nastavlja-pobjednicki-niz-sammir-i-eduardo-u-postavi---280080.html |publisher=gol.dnevnik.hr|date=26 March 2013|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pope|first=Bruce|title=Wales 1 – 2 Croatia |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21881457 |publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 March 2013|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial penalty was given, which was converted by [[Neymar]] and led to Brazil's eventual 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Brazil 3–1 Croatia |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285029|work=BBC Sport| date=12 June 2014|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Brazil v Croatia referee scandalous – Dejan Lovren| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27827271 |work=BBC Sport|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to showing disrespect towards the Spanish national team and flag and a deliberate elbowing of Sergio Ramos, on 11 January 2019 UEFA banned Lovren for one international match, a [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying]] match against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]].{{cn|date=February 2019}}

==Personal life==
Lovren first became involved in an [[on-again, off-again relationship|on and off relationship]] with Anita Sekulić in 2005, when he was aged 16. The couple went through a crisis during Lovren's life in [[Lyon]], splitting up for a short time, but then reconciled. Soon after, Sekulić got pregnant and the couple married in July 2012. On 28 August of the same year, the couple became parents of a daughter named Elena. In June 2013, the couple married in a church. On 21 June 2015, they became parents of a son, Josip, named after Dejan's paternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="lajk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/lovrenovi-prijatelji-otkrivaju-pravi-uzrok-sukoba-s-cacicem-dejan-je-zeni-obecao-dva-tjedna-u-lipnju.-imaju-problema-u-braku/3740361/|title=LOVRENOVI PRIJATELJI OTKRIVAJU PRAVI UZROK SUKOBA S ČAČIĆEM 'Dejan je ženi obećao dva tjedna u lipnju. Imaju problema u braku!'|first=Mark|last=Cigoj|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2016, the public found out about Anita's affair with a forestry worker Dario Torbić, an old friend of hers. Lovren tried and managed to win her back with a make-or-break holiday in June, since he was not chosen for [[UEFA Euro 2016 squads#Croatia|Croatia's Euro 2016 squad]].
 
In 2013, Lovren founded a fashion brand ''Russell Brown'' with his [[groomsman|best man]] Lovro Krčar. Three years after, the brand was shut down due to unknown reasons. Rumours suggest that the reason for the closure was due to a poor relationship between Lovren and Krčar. In May 2018, he founded another brand ''Rock Filius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://miss7.24sata.hr/amp/moda/dejan-lovren-ima-novi-modni-brend-opet-20281|title=Dejan Lovren ima novi modni brend - opet!|first=Anamaria|last=Butković|newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]]|date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2018, Lovren opened a four star hotel ''Joel'' in [[Novalja]], near [[Zrće]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.24sata.hr/show/uz-blagoslov-svecenika-dejan-lovren-je-otvorio-svoj-hotel-575772|title=Uz blagoslov svećenika Dejan Lovren je otvorio svoj hotel|first=Rozeta|last=Bogeljić|newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]]|date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Brazil]], paparazzi leaked explicit photos of several Croatian internationals taking a "[[nude swimming|skinny dip]]" in the pool of the Brazilian hotel they resided in. Lovren was the one who reportedly suffered the most since almost his entire body was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://m.vecernji.hr/sport/goli-lovren-i-carli-opustali-se-na-bazenu-u-drustvu-srne-i-modrica-944937|title=Goli Lovren i Čarli opuštali se na bazenu u društvu Srne i Modrića|newspaper=[[Večernji list]]|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Philip Milner''' (born 4 January 1986) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. A versatile player, he has been used in many different positions such as on the [[winger (association football)|wing]], in [[midfielder|midfield]] and at [[full back (association football)|full back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier League Late Mail: Asian Cup causing headaches, Manchester United trio in doubt |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/premier-league-late-mail-asian-cup-causing-headaches-manchester-united-trio-in-doubt/news-story/4c7626e0bbbb1aec6e74da8b577b53dd |website=Fox Sports Australia |publisher=News Corp |accessdate=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner's talent in football, cricket, and long-distance running was recognised at a very young age. He represented his school in these sports and played football for amateur teams from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]] and [[Horsforth]]. He supported [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] from a young age and was a [[season ticket]] holder at the club. In 1996, he joined the Leeds United youth academy. He made his debut for the first team in 2002 aged only 16 and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the Premier League.

While at Leeds United, he spent time on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first-team player. Following his move to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], he was loaned to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a season. He went on to make over 100 appearances for Newcastle, before returning to Aston Villa on a permanent transfer in 2008. After playing an influential role in Aston Villa's run to the [[2010 Football League Cup Final|2010 League Cup Final]] and being named [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]] [[PFA Young Player of the Year]], Milner joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for a reported £26m transfer fee in 2010, going on to win the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12]] and [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] [[List of English football champions|Premier League title]]s, [[2010–11 FA Cup]] and [[2013–14 Football League Cup|2013–14 League Cup]]. After five seasons with Manchester City, Milner signed for Liverpool on a free transfer in 2015.

Milner made a record 46 appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team]], playing at the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2007]] and [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2009]] [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]s. He also played 61 appearances for the full [[England national football team|English national team]], scoring once against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]]. He was selected for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] [[FIFA World Cup]] squads, as well as the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA Euro Championship]]s. Milner retired from international football in 2016.

==Early life==
Born in [[Wortley, Leeds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Stewart |title=James Milner: England midfielder at World Cup 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/players/6599044/James-Milner-England-midfielder-at-World-Cup-2010.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner played most of his childhood football for [[Westbrook Lane Primary School]] in [[Horsforth]]. He was later educated at [[Horsforth School]]. Graeme Coulson, a coach from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], recognised Milner's talent and persuaded him to play for Rawdon in several tournaments, including a tournament at Rawdon Meadows, where Milner scored four goals in their victory in the final.&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt;

Milner was described as a "first class" student at his school; he left with 11 [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]] and an award for his performance in [[physical education]].&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunday Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Roy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2320779/James-Milner-keeps-feet-on-the-ground.html |title=James Milner keeps feet on the ground |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner played for the Yorkshire Schools cricket team, was the cross-country champion at his school for three consecutive years and was the district champion over 100&amp;nbsp;metres for two years in a row.&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt; He then completed his studies at [[Boston Spa School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Come on and join the girls |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/come_on_and_join_the_girls_1_2264869 |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |location=Leeds |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sports college which was a partner to the football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leeds United Foundation |url=http://www.bostonspa.leeds.sch.uk/leeds-united-foundation |publisher=Boston Spa School |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125213928/http://www.bostonspa.leeds.sch.uk/leeds-united-foundation |archivedate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner supported his hometown club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] from a young age. His earliest memory of the team was watching them win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1993. He and his parents, Peter and Lesley, were [[season ticket]] holders and Milner later became a [[ball boy]] for the club.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaw |first=Phil |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/james-milner-players-my-age-want-to-play-in-the-world-cup-im-no-different-335751.html |title=James Milner: 'Players my age want to play in the World Cup. I'm no different' |newspaper=The Independent |date=31 December 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Milner was 10 years old, he joined the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a [[scout (sport)|scout]] while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth.&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt; At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, including future [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] striker [[Wayne Rooney]]. His role model was Leeds-born [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1980)|Alan Smith]], who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, to come through the academy and play for the first team.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school.&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt; However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education.&lt;ref name="birthday boy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Townsend |first=Nick |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/the-birthday-boy-in-a-very-different-world-from-wayne-573989.html |title=The birthday boy in a very different world from Wayne |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 January 2004 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels.&lt;ref name="Milner child"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wrigglesworth |first=Dave |url=http://www.horsforth.leeds.sch.uk/newslet/dec00/sports.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030511092833/http://www.horsforth.leeds.sch.uk/newslet/dec00/sports.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2003 |title=Profile of James Milner: aged 14 years |publisher=Horsforth School |accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], scoring a goal against Brazil.&lt;ref name="Under-17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2002/07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20040828110908/http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2002/07 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 August 2004 |title=Milner magic seals Nationwide Glory |publisher=The Football Association |date=14 July 2002 |accessdate=28 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
Milner's first-team debut for Leeds came on 10 November 2002, in a match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], when he came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Jason Wilcox]] for the last six minutes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The appearance made him the second youngest player ever to play in the [[Premier League]], at the age of 16 years and 309 days.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; On 26 December 2002, he became at 16 years and 356 days the youngest player to score in the Premier League, with a goal in a 2–1 win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Premiership's youngest guns |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_2609000/2609487.stm |date=27 December 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His record was broken by [[James Vaughan (footballer, born 1988)|James Vaughan]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/photo_galleries/photos_of_the_day/4432217.stm |title=Youngest Premiership goalscorers |publisher=BBC |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] a month later, Milner scored again, with a deft first touch of the ball and manoeuvre, in order to avoid a tackle from Chelsea defender [[Marcel Desailly]], that won widespread praise from commentators.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The manoeuvre created a yard of space for him to deliver a curling shot from {{convert|18|yd|m|0}}.&lt;ref name="Chelsea goal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Goal of the week – Master Milner's class act |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 December 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2613467.stm |accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters were impressed by his overall performance in the match, especially by his desire, confidence, and ability with both feet.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Chelsea manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] remarked after the match that Milner had performed like a much more experienced player.&lt;ref name=Chelsea2&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Milner fills Leeds with teen spirit |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 December 2002 |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,-40980,00.html |accessdate=28 July 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance prompted comparisons to [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Michael Owen]] and Wayne Rooney, who had also come to footballing prominence as teenagers.&lt;ref name=Chelsea&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawrence |first=Amy |title=Magical Milner |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 December 2002 |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-40980,00.html |accessdate=28 July 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more appearances for Leeds, Milner signed a five-year contract with them on 10 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Milner signs Leeds deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/2745555.stm |accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the [[2003–04 Swindon Town F.C. season|2003–04 season]], Milner was sent on a one-month [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first-team player.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Before the stint, he saw it as a valuable experience as a player.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; He spent a month with Swindon, playing in six matches and scoring two goals against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/3113816.stm |title=Swindon 2–0 Peterborough |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2003 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/3139868.stm |title=Swindon 2–2 Luton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2003 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Leeds' fortunes were on the decline; the team became the subject of numerous negative stories in the media, and several first-team players were sold.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Milner said he believed that this experience made him emotionally stronger and taught him how to deal with team problems.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Leeds's eventual [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] led to speculation over Milner's future at the club.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and Everton all expressed an interest in signing him.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web |title=16 James Milner – Midfielder |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=26843&amp;cc=5739 |accessdate=28 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Villa and Everton did not make offers and Milner rejected an offer from Tottenham as they were based too far from his family home, where he still lived.&lt;ref name="Milner plots Leeds deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milner plots Leeds deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3710803.stm |accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=versatile&gt;{{cite news |last=Lucas |first=Ed |title=Versatile Milner may be right for the England left |newspaper=The Independent |date=25 July 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/versatile-milner-may-be-right-for-the-england-left-554395.html |accessdate=19 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds insisted that he would not be sold and the chairman of the club at the time even referred to him as "the future of Leeds".&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Nonetheless, financial problems eventually forced Leeds to sell Milner to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for an initial price of £3.6&amp;nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Although Milner was not happy to be leaving the club he had supported as a child, he wished to do what was "in the club's best interest"&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; and in July 2004, he agreed a five-year contract with Newcastle.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

===Newcastle United===
[[File:Milner2.JPG|thumb|upright|Milner playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2004]]

Milner made his first appearance for Newcastle United during their pre-season tour of Asia, scoring his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against [[Kitchee SC|Kitchee]], in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Impact&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=James |title=Robson delight at Milner impact |publisher=Sky Sports |date=19 July 2004 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2305641,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this tour, he took the opportunity to observe how Newcastle striker [[Alan Shearer]] dealt with attention from fans and the media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He said that his association with people like Shearer gave him a better idea of how to deal with the media.&lt;ref name="Sunday Telegraph"/&gt;

Milner's first Premier League match for Newcastle came against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 18 August 2004, in which he played on the extreme right of the field as a [[winger (association football)|winger]], despite having featured regularly on the left for Leeds.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When asked about this after the match, Milner said he had no preference where on the pitch he played.&lt;ref name=position&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Rourke |first=Peter |title=Milner makes Magpies vow |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 August 2004 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2308355,00.html |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later he made his debut in European competition, when Newcastle played in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] against [[Bnei Sakhnin F.C.|Bnei Sakhnin]] from Israel, after coming on as a substitute for [[Shola Ameobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newcastle 2–0 Bnei Sakhnin |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 September 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3656126.stm |accessdate=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, he scored his first competitive goal for the club, also as a substitute, in a 3–1 win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newcastle 3–1 West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3661816.stm |accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed for Milner after Newcastle manager [[Bobby Robson]], whom Milner considered his mentor, was sacked and replaced by [[Graeme Souness]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Under Souness, he started 13 league matches, but did not play his first full Premier League match for Newcastle until April 2005.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Milner said that he was frustrated at not being used as a starter for most of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=Milner's Magpies hope |publisher=Sky Sports |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2330925,00.html |accessdate=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[2005–06 Newcastle United F.C. season|2005–06 season]], Milner scored in Newcastle's 3–1 away win against [[MFK Dubnica|FK ZTS Dubnica]] in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], and also set up Alan Shearer for the team's third goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ZTS Dubnica 1–3 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 June 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4689063.stm |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clause in Newcastle's purchase of [[Nolberto Solano]] from Aston Villa resulted in Milner being loaned to Villa for the rest of the season.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Villa manager [[David O'Leary]], who had managed Milner at Leeds, was happy to acquire Milner in this deal, saying that he believed Villa got the better of the deal and that he hoped to improve him as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=James |title=O'Leary happy with Nobby deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 September 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2347428,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=O'Leary to improve Milner |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 September 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2347843,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aston Villa (loan)====
Milner made his Villa debut on 12 September 2005 in a Premier League match against West Ham United.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Five days later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match less than a week later, he helped his team recover from being 3–1 down at half-time to win 8–3 against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], scoring two goals in the second half comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Higham |first=Paul |title=Villa comeback stuns Wycombe |publisher=Sky Sports |date=20 September 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_2561788,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season Milner was positive about his team.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He remained confident that Villa would recover from a poor start to the season and praised the quality of the squad.&lt;ref name=team&gt;{{cite news |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=Milner upbeat for Villa |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 October 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2350606,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner was generally seen as a positive signing in a season that was disappointing for Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rutledge |first=Lewis |title=O'Leary joy at Milner return |publisher=Sky Sports |date=14 April 2006 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2373489,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner himself also received the loan move positively, saying that he would like to join Villa permanently because of the probability of becoming a regular starter, but said that the possibility of this happening was beyond his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=Milner waits on future |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 December 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2358774,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager David O'Leary confirmed during the season that he would like Milner to join the club permanently, but doubted he would be given the opportunity to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Livie |first=Alex |title=O'Leary expects to lose Milner |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 November 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2355212,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even pulled out of signing [[Robert Huth]] so that he would have the funds to sign Milner permanently if the opportunity arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=Villa out of Huth chase |publisher=Sky Sports |date=23 December 2005 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_2358958,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the end of his loan period, negotiations between Villa and Newcastle began.

The newly appointed Newcastle manager [[Glenn Roeder]] appeared to appreciate Milner's ability more than Souness and expressed a desire that he remain a Newcastle player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glenn Roeder has again said that James Milner's future lies at St James' Park |publisher=fansfc.com |date=27 June 2006 |url=http://www.fansfc.com/newcastlefootballclub/news.asp?newsid=154475 |accessdate=26 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709163408/http://www.fansfc.com/newcastlefootballclub/news.asp?newsid=154475 |archivedate=9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, as well as the departure of O'Leary and the shortage of transfer funds at Villa, meant that a deal to sign Milner permanently seemed unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Milner move to Villa is in doubt |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 May 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5003814.stm |accessdate=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, it became even less likely when Villa rejected an offer of Milner as part of a trade for [[Gareth Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Phil |title=Villa no to Barry-Milner swap |publisher=Sky Sports |date=14 June 2006 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2380236,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deal was resurrected when Villa were taken over by American billionaire [[Randy Lerner]], and [[Martin O'Neill]] was appointed as new Villa manager.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Villa made an improved offer on 30 August, which was accepted by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £4&amp;nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A move to Villa appeared to have been agreed, but at the last moment Newcastle recalled Milner and the talks broke down.&lt;ref name=Roeder&gt;{{cite news |last=Buckingham |first=Mark |title=Roeder backs Milner stance |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2388251,00.html |accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=O'Neill upset over Milner episode |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5306302.stm |accessdate=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Newcastle United====
[[File:James Milner 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Milner taking a free kick for Newcastle United in 2007]]

Newcastle's players and manager Glenn Roeder reacted positively to Milner's return at the start of the [[2006–07 Newcastle United F.C. season|2006–07 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sol hails return of young gun Milner |publisher=officialplayersites |date=14 July 2006 |url=http://www.officialplayersites.com/players/solano/article.php?id=815 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner was a starter in the Newcastle team for the entire season.&lt;ref name=Roeder/&gt;

Newcastle made a poor start in the [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07 Premier League]], but in European competition, Milner played a key role in helping Newcastle advance through the group stage of the [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Shortly after, rumours began to spread that he would be sold during the [[transfer window]] in January, although both Milner and Roeder dismissed these rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Rourke |first=Peter |title=Milner expects Toon stay |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 December 2006 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_2396713,00.html |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner, in his time at the club, was described on the Newcastle United official website as "a good reader of the game".&lt;ref name=nufc&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0,,10278~23079,00.html |accessdate=29 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813221343/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0,,10278~23079,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This awareness allows him to pass the ball from a range of positions to teammates making forward runs, as well as giving him the confidence to take on defenders.&lt;ref name=everything2/&gt; His awareness and willingness to pass have been called mature for a player of his age.&lt;ref name=Chelsea/&gt;

The following season, he was selected as the Austrian Bundesliga Player of the Year.

Keïta was named in the squad of the season for the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]], in which his team were quarter-finalists.&lt;ref name=europa/&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 28 August 2017, a deal was struck for Keïta to join [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 1 July 2018 after the English club triggered his £48&amp;nbsp;million release clause in addition to paying an undisclosed premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naby Keita: Liverpool agree club-record deal for Leipzig midfielder for July 2018|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41075272|accessdate=28 August 2017|publisher=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool agree deal to sign Naby Keita|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/273590-liverpool-agree-deal-to-sign-naby-keita|accessdate=29 August 2017|publisher=Liverpool FC|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There would be no premium (£48&amp;nbsp;million total) if Leipzig did not qualify for European football, £4.75&amp;nbsp;million (£52.75&amp;nbsp;million total) if they qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] and £11&amp;nbsp;million (£59&amp;nbsp;million total) if they finished in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League spots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RB Leipzig's Season Finish Could Wind Up Increasing Liverpool's Fee for Naby Keita|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2017/12/14/contract-clause-revealed-will-force-liverpool-pay-more-rb-leipzig-star-naby-keita|accessdate=14 December 2017|website=Sports Illustrated|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leipzig finished 6th in the Bundesliga, qualifying for the Europa League.

Upon joining Liverpool he was handed the number 8 shirt by Liverpool legend [[Steven Gerrard]] which had been vacated upon the departure of Gerrard to [[LA Galaxy]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naby Keita: Steven Gerrard handed me the No.8 jersey|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/305366-naby-keita-steven-gerrard-number-eight|accessdate=14 December 2018|website=Liverpool FC|date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naby Keita Was Handed The Number 8 Shirt By Steven Gerrard|url=http://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news-naby-keta-reveals-the-brilliant-way-he-was-handed-the-number-8-jers-20180627|accessdate=14 December 2018|website=SPORTbible|date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keïta made his debut for Liverpool against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 12 August 2018 and played a part in the opening goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] in a 4–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Naby Keita impressed for Liverpool on his debut against West Ham |first=Adam |last=Bate |work=Sky Sports |date=13 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018 |url= https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12028/11471028/naby-keita-impressed-for-liverpool-on-his-debut-against-west-ham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 28 July 2013, Keïta made his international debut for the [[Guinea national football team|Guinea national team]] against [[Mali national football team|Mali]] in a [[2014 African Nations Championship qualification]] match. He came on as a half-time substitute for [[Naby Laye Camara]] in the 1–0 home win.&lt;ref name=nft&gt;{{cite web |title=Keïta, Naby |url=https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/53218/Naby_Keita.html |publisher=National Football Teams |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was included in [[Michel Dussuyer]]'s 23-man squad for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] in Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2015 Nations Cup: Constant included in Guinea squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30636144 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening match against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], he was struck in the face by [[Gervinho]], who was sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afcon 2015: Two-match ban as Gervinho apologises for red card |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30907505 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2015, he scored his first international goal, the only one away to [[Namibia national football team|Namibia]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF Second Round|the first leg of the second round]] of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coupe du monde 2018 : la Guinée s’en sort bien en Namibie|trans-title=2018 World Cup: Guinea travel well in Namibia |url=http://afriquefoot.rfi.fr/20151112-football-coupe-monde-2018-eliminatoires-namibie-guinee-luis-fernandez |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=RFi |date=12 November 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later in the return leg – in Morocco due to the [[Ebola virus epidemic in Guinea]] – he scored again in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CM 2018 : La Guinée confirme et se qualifie|trans-title=WC 2018: Guinea confirm and qualify |url=http://www.afrik-foot.com/cm-2018-la-guinee-confirme-et-se-qualifie |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=Afrik Foot |date=15 November 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document falsification charges==
In autumn 2017, Keïta was charged with uttering false documents. The German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'' reported that, in early December 2016 and again six weeks later, he had presented two fake Guinean driver's licences in order to obtain a driving licence in Germany. The district court in Leipzig ''(Amtsgericht Leipzig)'' fined him €415,000 to be paid in 50 daily instalments of €8,300, basing the sentence on Keïta's net annual income of around €3 million. Keïta's lawyer filed an appeal against the sentence which was to come on before the same court in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leipzig-Star soll ein Vermögen an Strafe zahlen|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/article170393361/Leipzig-Star-soll-ein-Vermoegen-an-Strafe-zahlen.html|accessdate=8 November 2017|newspaper=Die Welt|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Keita has been described as a dynamic, box-to-box central midfielder. He is able to distribute the ball with range and accuracy, score goals frequently and has been compared to [[N'Golo Kanté]] and [[Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nick Ames and Nick Miller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/rising-stars-10-players-watch-2017 |title=Rising football stars: 10 players to watch in 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starting his career with [[Figueirense Futebol Clube|Figueirense]] in 2009, he spent four-and-a-half seasons at [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|Hoffenheim]]. His 16 goals in 33 games for the [[2013–14 Bundesliga]] season earned him the award for the league's Breakthrough Player. In July 2015, he signed for Premier League club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. His creativity, goalscoring and work rate have earned him plaudits at Liverpool, with manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] referring to Firmino as the "engine" that propels the club’s counter-attacking system.&lt;ref name="engine"/&gt;

Firmino made his international debut for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in November 2014 and represented the nation at the [[2015 Copa América]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Maceió]], [[Alagoas]], Firmino joined [[Figueirense FC|Figueirense]]'s youth setup in 2008, aged 17, after starting out at [[Clube de Regatas Brasil|CRB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/selecao-brasileira/noticia/2015/06/de-volante-no-crb-alvo-de-ingleses-firmino-emociona-amigo-de-maceio.html|title=De volante no CRB a alvo de ingleses, Firmino emociona amigo de Maceió|trans-title=From a defensive midfielder at CRB to English clubs' target, Firmino thrills a friend from Maceió|publisher=Globo Esporte|language=Portuguese|date=22 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discovered by a dentist, Marcellus Portella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Firmino made his professional debut on 24 October 2009, coming on as a half-time [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for Toninho in a 1–2 home loss against [[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]], for the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/esportes/noticia/2009/10/figueirense-perde-para-a-ponte-preta-e-ve-g-4-se-distanciar-2695928.html|title=Figueirense perde para a Ponte Preta e vê G-4 se distanciar|trans-title=Figueirense loses to Ponte Preta and sees ''G-4'' more distant|publisher=ZH Esportes|language=Portuguese|date=24 October 2009|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 he was promoted to the main squad.

Firmino scored his first professional goal on 8 May 2010, netting the winner in an away success against [[Associação Desportiva São Caetano|São Caetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/119888_figueirense-estreia-com-vitoria-em-cima-do-sao-caetano|title=Figueirense estreia com vitória em cima do São Caetano|trans-title=Figueirense debuts with victory over São Caetano|publisher=[[ESPN Brasil]]|language=Portuguese|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed with eight goals in 36 appearances during [[2010 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|the season]], as ''Figueira'' returned to [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] after a two-year absence.

Firmino signed with [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|Hoffenheim]] in December 2010, with the contract running until June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/15/germany/2010/12/14/2260375/official-hoffenheim-sign-roberto-firmino-from-figueirense|title=Official: Hoffenheim Sign Roberto Firmino From Figueirense|date=14 December 2010|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally arrived at Hoffenheim on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{fussballdaten|id=firminoroberto|name=Roberto Firmino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hoffenheim manager Ernst Tanner commented that they were "pleased to hire a Brazilian talent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoffenheim contrata Roberto Firmino, do Figueirense|trans-title=Hoffenheim sign Figueirense's Roberto Firmino|url=http://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,hoffenheim-contrata-roberto-firmino-do-figueirense,653190|publisher=Esportes Estadao|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut a month later in a [[Bundesliga]] defeat against [[FSV Mainz 05|Mainz]], where he came on as a 75th-minute substitute for [[Sebastian Rudy]].&lt;ref name = "SW"/&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on 16 April, the only goal of a league victory against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eintracht stürzt weiter ab|url=http://www.fr-online.de/eintracht-frankfurt/0-1-gegen-hoffenheim-eintracht-stuerzt-weiter-ab-,1473446,8350838.html|publisher=FR-Online|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was dropped from the first-team squad along with [[Chinedu Obasi]] at the end of November 2011 for showing up late for training, missing the league match against [[Bayer Leverkusen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15965449.stm|title=Chinedu Obasi dropped from Hoffenheim squad|date=30 November 2011|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored two more goals that season, against Wolfsburg and [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt; In the 2012–13 season, Firmino made 36 appearances and scored seven goals.&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt;

In July 2013, Russian club [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] made a €12 million bid for Firmino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1899 Hoffenheim: Geht Roberto Firmino nach Russland?|url=http://www.t-online.de/sport/id_64339112/tsg-1899-hoffenheim-geht-roberto-firmino-nach-russland-.html|accessdate=8 January 2018|publisher=T-Online|date=5 July 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffenheim captain [[Andreas Beck (footballer)|Andreas Beck]] hailed Firmino's development as "outstanding" in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberto Firmino: "Ich bin wie befreit"|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/590936/artikel_roberto-firmino_ich-bin-wie-befreit.html#omsearchresult|publisher=Kicker|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 2014, Firmino extended his contract with the club, signing a three-year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Roberto Firmino verlängert Vertrag bis 2017 |url=http://www.achtzehn99.de/roberto-firmino-verlaengert-vertrag-bis-2017/ |work=TSG 1899 Hoffenheim |date=27 March 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the [[2013–14 Bundesliga]] season tied as the fourth highest scorer with 16 goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top scorers 2013/2014|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/stats/player-stats/?liga=51&amp;season=2013&amp;art=goalgetter&amp;matchday=season}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named the league's Breakthrough Player.&lt;ref name=break/&gt;

On 23 June 2015, while he was competing for Brazil at the [[2015 Copa América|Copa América]], Hoffenheim and Firmino agreed terms for him to transfer to [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for up to £29 million on conclusion of the tournament, subject to a work permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ben|title=Roberto Firmino: Liverpool agree £29m deal for Brazil striker|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33250535|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool confirmed the signing the following day, subject to a medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/187533-liverpool-complete-firmino-signing |title=Liverpool complete Firmino signing |publisher=Liverpool FC |first=James |last=Carroll |date=24 June 2015 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was finalised on 4 July.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Neil|title=Roberto Firmino will bring joy to Liverpool FC fans, says Ryan Babel|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roberto-firmino-bring-joy-liverpool-9586520|accessdate=4 July 2015|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2015–16 season ====
Firmino made his Liverpool debut in a pre-season friendly away to [[Swindon Town]] on 2 August,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Neil|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool striker scores in Swindon friendly|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33754238|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his league debut a week later, replacing [[Jordon Ibe]] for the final 12 minutes of a 1–0 win at [[Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafez|first1=Shamoon|title=Stoke 0-1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33750574|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, Firmino scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 4–1 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/man-city-vs-liverpool/341310|title=Manchester City 1-4 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp masterminds stunning win|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Firmino was described by Paul Little of the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' as steadily improving during his first season in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Little|first1=Paul|title=Klopp must counter cultural legacy to free Benteke potential|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/klopp-must-counter-cultural-legacy-to-free-benteke-potential-377709.html|accessdate=24 January 2016|work=Irish Examiner|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an inability to combine with centre forward [[Christian Benteke]] drew criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jurgen Klopp says Christian Benteke has Liverpool future|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/10137092/christian-benteke-does-have-a-future-at-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-insists|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=Sky Sports|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firmino said that it was his "dream" to play in the national team though he had no "contact with national team manager [[Dunga]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firmino: "Ich will noch viel mehr"|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/608759/artikel_firmino_ich-will-noch-viel-mehr.html#omsearchresult|publisher=Kicker|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2014, Firmino received his first call up to [[Brazil national football team]] for the friendly matches against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

==Style of play==
[[File:Russia-Brazil 2018 (11) (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|330x330px|Firmino is known for his creativity, link-up play, goalscoring and workrate.]]
At Hoffenheim, Firmino primarily played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{NFT player|pid=57643|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was also utilised as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], with Firmino using his speed, close control and vision wherever he is deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberto Firmino|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/player/roberto-firmino|website=liverpoolfc.com|publisher=Liverpool Football Club|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially starting as a left winger at Liverpool under [[Brendan Rodgers]], new manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] utilised Firmino more centrally, initially as a [[False 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Firmino’s excellent false nine display almost led Liverpool to victory|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/michael-cox-how-firminos-excellent-false-nine-display-almost-led-liverpool-victory|website=FourFourTwo.com|publisher=FourFourTwo|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after impressing under Klopp's pressing system, Firmino established himself as Liverpool's first choice [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]] by the [[2017–18 Liverpool F.C. season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why there's nothing false with Roberto Firmino being Liverpool's new number nine|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-firmino-champions-league-coutinho-13472096|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Doyle of the ''Liverpool Echo'' referred to him as "a true Liverpool number nine", whose "numbers are up there with [[Harry Kane]] and [[Sergio Agüero]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Firmino is now a true Liverpool number nine – and his numbers are up there with Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Morata |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roberto-firmino-now-true-liverpool-13988099 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ryan Babel]], a teammate of Firmino's at Hoffenheim, described him as "A tricky player. He can dribble, shoot, he has a great shot, he can play a lot of through balls and his assists are very good", while also praising a heading ability which would not be common amongst other players of Firmino's stature. Babel also stated that Firmino had a humble mentality and no problems with attitude.&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; In addition to his technical skills, creativity, link-up play, and goalscoring, Firmino has also been praised by his managers, teammates, and pundits for his positional sense, intelligent movement, and ability to make attacking runs off the ball, which often draws opposing players out of position and creates space for his teammates.&lt;ref name="Firmino-key-Liverpool"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/10/roberto-firmino-key-liverpools-heavy-metal-style-play/|title=Why Roberto Firmino is so key to Liverpool's heavy metal style of play|work=The Telegraph|first=J.

'''Sadio Mané''' (born 10 April 1992) is a Senegalese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]].

Having begun his career with [[FC Metz|Metz]] in France, he transferred to [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in 2012. After winning the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga#Österreichische Fußball-Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] and [[Austrian Cup]] in [[2013–14 FC Red Bull Salzburg season|2014]], he was signed by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In [[2014–15 Southampton F.C. season|2015]], Mané set a new [[Premier League]] [[Premier League records and statistics|record]] for the fastest [[hat-trick]] when he scored three times in 176 seconds during a 6–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref name=trick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/16/southampton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report|title=Southampton’s Sadio Mané hits record hat-trick to rout Aston Villa|date=16 May 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to Liverpool in 2016 for a fee of £34 million, making him the most expensive African player in history at that time.&lt;ref name=BBC36642523/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eight things about the Premier League Africans|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37255038|agency=BBC News|date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since joining Liverpool, Mané among other achievements scored in the [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final]].

Mané has earned over 50 [[Cap (association football)|caps]] for Senegal since his debut in 2012, and represented the national team at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]], [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]], [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Sédhiou]], Sénégal, Mané started his career at the Académie Génération Foot, Senegalese football academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio MANE de passage à l’Académie Génération Foot|url=http://www.asgenerationfoot.com/site/?p=3424|publisher=Academie Generation Foot|language=French}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mané made his professional debut for [[FC Metz|Metz]] on 14 January 2012, coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Kévin Diaz (footballer born 1988)|Kévin Diaz]] in the 75th minute of a 0–1 home defeat against [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] in [[Ligue 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metz 0–1 Bastia|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/01/14/france/ligue-2/fc-de-metz/sporting-club-de-bastia/1115285/|website=Soccerway|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 19 appearances in [[2011–12 Ligue 2|his first league season]], 12 as a starter, and scored a solitary goal in a 2–5 loss to [[EA Guingamp|Guingamp]] at the [[Stade Saint-Symphorien]] on 4 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metz 2–5 Guingamp| url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/05/04/france/ligue-2/fc-de-metz/en-avant-de-guingamp/1115453/|website=Soccerway|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metz were [[relegation|relegated]] to the [[Championnat National]] at the end of the season.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
[[File:RBS gegen Metz59.JPG|thumb|Mané (right) playing for [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in 2013]]

On 31 August 2012, Mané moved to [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] side [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] for the third biggest transfer fee that [[FC Metz]] had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio Mané transféré au Red Bull Salzburg|trans-title=Sadio Mané transferred to Red Bull Salzburg|url=http://www.fcmetz.com/article/Transfert/2012-08-31-17-25-55_sadio-mane-transfere-au-red-bull-salzburg.html|website=www.fcmetz.com|publisher=[[FC Metz]]|accessdate=2 September 2014|language=French|date=31 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103230754/http://www.fcmetz.com/article/Transfert/2012-08-31-17-25-55_sadio-mane-transfere-au-red-bull-salzburg.html|archivedate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Bullen im Kaufrausch|trans-title=The Bulls on a spending spree|url=http://www.news.at/a/red-bull-salzburg-die-bullen-kaufrausch-340805|website=www.news.at|publisher=news.at|accessdate=2 September 2014|language=German|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was believed to be €4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://diepresse.com/home/sport/fussball/national/3840165/Salzburg_Wer-Geld-hat-kann-gross-einkaufen | title =Salzburg: Wer Geld hat, kann groß einkaufen | language = German | trans-title = Salzburg: Who got money, can go on a shopping spree | publisher = [[Die Presse]] | accessdate = 2 September 2014 | date = 17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first [[hat-trick]] for the club on 31 October, in a 3–1 away win at [[SC Kalsdorf|Kalsdorf]] in the third round of the [[Austrian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalsdorf 1–3 Salzburg|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/match/kalsdorf-vs-salzburg/1397693/lineups|website=Goal.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2013, he netted his first hat-trick in the Austrian Bundesliga, during a 3–0 win away to [[SV Grödig|Grödig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grödig 0–3 Salzburg|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/gr%C3%B6dig-vs-salzburg/1487388/preview|website=Goal.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored another treble on 7 May 2014 as Salzburg won 7–0 at [[SV Horn|Horn]] in the cup semi-finals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bulls in cup final after goal fest!|url=http://www.redbulls.com/en/fc-red-bull-salzburg/news/saison_2013_14/red-bulls-in-cup-final-after-goal-fest.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=[[Red Bull]]|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the season ended with the team winning a domestic [[Double (association football)|double]]. At the end of August 2014 Mané forced a transfer out of the club, by not coming to the training and to the most important game for Salzburg at that time to qualify for the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltfussball.at/news/_n1232661_/skandal-um-sadio-mane-vor-malmoe-spiel/ Skandal um Sadio Mané vor Malmö-Spiel], weltfussball.at, 26 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
====2014–15 season====
On 1 September 2014, Mané transferred to [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for £11.8 million, signing a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Southampton sign £10m forward Sadio Mane &amp; Toby Alderweireld |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29025087|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| accessdate=3 September 2014|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut 22 days later in a 2–1 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], winning the penalty for Southampton's first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arsenal 1–2 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29216769 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first league appearance for the club in another 2–1 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 27 September, starting and assisting [[Ryan Bertrand]] for the first goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289926|title=Southampton 2–1 Queens Park Rangers|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in an 8–0 victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 18 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reddy |first1=Luke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29580147 |title=Southampton 8–0 Sunderland |work=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was subsequently credited as an own goal by [[Patrick van Aanholt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 8 – 0 Sunderland |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/matches/2014-2015/epl.match-stats.html/southampton-vs-sunderland|publisher=Premier League |accessdate=24 October 2014|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, score his first goal in his next game, a 1–0 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canavan|first1=Steve|title=Southampton 1–0 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29670448|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=26 October 2014|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December and January he scored in three successive matches, against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544147 |title=Crystal Palace 1–3 Southampton |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=26 December 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30566736 |title=Southampton 1–1 Chelsea |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=28 December 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30600817 |title=Southampton 2–0 Arsenal |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mané scored two late winning goals in 1–0 league victories at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 7 February 2015 and at home to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 3 March respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31071178 | title=QPR 0–1 Southampton | publisher=BBC Sport | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31598153 | title=Southampton 1–0 Crystal Palace | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=3 March 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mané had been dropped from Southampton's starting line-up for their 0–2 home defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 22 February as a punishment for being late to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton: Sadio Mane dropped for being late – Koeman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31579123|accessdate=22 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, during Southampton's final home match of the season, Mané scored three times in 2 minutes 56 seconds in a 6–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to set a new [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] for the fastest [[hat-trick]]. The record had been held since 1994 by [[Robbie Fowler]], who scored three against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 4 minutes and 33 seconds.&lt;ref name=trick/&gt; Mané finished the season with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions.

====2015–16 season====
[[File:Audi- quattro-Cup 23.JPG|thumb|Mané (right) playing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2015]]

Mané began the [[2015–16 Southampton F.C. season|2015–16 season]] by registering two assists in the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] third qualifying round first leg match with [[Vitesse Arnhem]] at home and scoring in the return leg, as Southampton eased through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33667103 | title=Southampton 3–0 Vitesse Arnhem | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33738509 | title=Vitesse Arnhem 0–2 Southampton | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=6 August 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, he took 39 seconds to open the scoring against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, but the Saints eventually lost 6–1 at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 1–6 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34918281|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2016, he was again dropped from the starting line-up by manager [[Ronald Koeman]] for a match at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] when he turned up late for a pre-match meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sadio Mane: Southampton midfielder dropped for being late|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35214588|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a straight red card on 12 March at the end of a 2–1 win at [[Stoke City]] for a collision into [[Erik Pieters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharpe|first1=Rich|title=Stoke City 1 Southampton 2: Ronald Koeman says his side will appeal against Sadio Mane’s red card|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-1-Southampton-2-Ronald-Koeman-says/story-28913551-detail/story.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=Stoke Sentinel|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was quickly overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton win appeal against Sadio Mane red card|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35803664|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio Mane's claim against red card upheld by Commission|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/governance/2016/mar/sadio-mane-southampton-red-card-appeal-upheld|publisher=The FA|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having failed to score in the league for over four months, Mané scored twice in a 3–2 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 March 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Mike|title=Southampton 3 Liverpool 2|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35796778|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 May 2016|date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by five goals in the next five matches, including a hat-trick in a 4–2 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=James|title=Southampton’s Sadio Mané in hat-trick romp against Manchester City|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report|accessdate=2 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season as Southampton's top scorer, with 15 goals in all competitions.

===Liverpool===

On 28 June 2016, Mané joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for a transfer fee of £34 million on a five-year contract.

'''Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly''' ({{lang-ar|محمد صلاح غالي}}&amp;nbsp;, {{IPA-arz|mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli}}; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egypt national team]]. He is considered Europe's top five leagues' fifth most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].{{efn|As of 7 January 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/245/en/ |title=Brand new list of top transfer values for big-5 league players |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=7 January 2019 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Salah started his senior career with Cairo club [[El Mokawloon SC|El Mokawloon]] in the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in 2010, departing shortly thereafter to join [[FC Basel|Basel]] for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, he starred as he won the league title in his debut season, winning the [[Swiss Super League|SAFP Golden Player Award]] in the process. Salah's performances then attracted [[Premier League]] side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and he joined the club for a £11&amp;nbsp;million fee in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to [[Serie A]] clubs [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15&amp;nbsp;million.

Following consistent match-winning performances in Rome to lead them to [[2016–17 A.S. Roma season|second-placed finish and a record points-tally]] in 2017, Salah relocated back to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9&amp;nbsp;million. During his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a complete [[Forward (association football)|forward]] and quickly became the focal point of the team. He would go on to break the club's scoring record for a debut season, receiving the [[Premier League Golden Boot]] after registering a record 32 goals in 36 league games. He also became the first player to win three [[Premier League Player of the Month]] awards in the same season. His record-breaking performances saw him receive a number of other accolades at the end of the season, including the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]], the [[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers' Player of the Year]] and the [[PFA Fans' Player of the Year]] awards. Salah also came third in the award for [[The Best FIFA Men's Player#Winners|the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player]].

At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level, winning a bronze medal in the [[Africa U-20 Cup of Nations]], and participated in the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. He was awarded the [[CAF Awards|CAF Most Promising African Talent]] of the Year in 2012.&lt;ref name="cafonline 21-12-2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/16154-toure-wins-his-second-african-player-of-the-year-award.html |title=Toure wins his second African Player of the Year Award |website=Confederation of African Football online.com |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=29 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194936/http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/16154-toure-wins-his-second-african-player-of-the-year-award.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making his debut with the senior national team in 2011, he helped Egypt reach the final of the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]], and he became the top scorer during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|CAF qualification]] to help the team qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. For his performances, Salah was named [[CAF African Footballer of the Year]] twice and the [[BBC African Footballer of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/liverpool-mohamed-salah-african-footballer-year |title=Liverpool's Mohamed Salah wins African footballer of the year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2018 |accessdate=4 January 2018 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/41802268 |title=Salah named African Footballer of the Year 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2017 |author=Paul Fletcher |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also selected in the [[CAF Team of the Year]] and [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations#Awards|Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/african-football/caf-announces-2017-african-team-of-the-year/286372 |title=CAF Announces 2017 African Team of the Year |website=soccerladuma.co.za |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/galleries/nations-cup-2017-team-of-the-tournament/1/1izlgkcrkx7gk1vkucyhqs6822 |title=Nations Cup 2017: Team of the Tournament |website=Goal.com |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===El Mokawloon===
Salah played his youth football with [[El Mokawloon SC|El Mokawloon]]. He made his senior team debut in the [[Egyptian Premier League]] coming on as a substitute on 3 May 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against [[El Mansoura SC|El Mansoura]]. During the [[2010–11 Egyptian Premier League|2010–11 season]] Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/mohamed-salah-how-a-boy-from-egypt-is-now-the-king-of-liverpool |title=Mohamed Salah: How a boy from Egypt is now the King of Liverpool |date=23 April 2018 |author=Saketh Ayyagari |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/413347/Live/Egypt-Premier-League-2010-2011-Al-Ahly-Al-Mokawloon-Al-Arab |title=Al Ahly 1–1 Al Mokawloon Al Arab – Premier League 2010/2011 Live |website=WhoScored.com |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a regular for El Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the [[2011-12 Egyptian Premier League|2011–12 season]]. Following the [[Port Said Stadium riot]] on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March 2012, the [[Egyptian Football Association]] announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17324997 |title=Egypt's Premier League cancelled |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basel===
[[Swiss Super League]] club [[FC Basel|Basel]] had been monitoring Salah for some time, so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt U-23 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2015/08/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-mohamed-salah |title=11 Things You Need to Know About Mohamed Salah |publisher=A.S. Roma |date=6 August 2015 |author=Paul Rogers |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match took place on 16 March at the [[Stadion Rankhof]] in [[Basel]], and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.&lt;ref name="Caspar Marti"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2012/03/16/Munteres-Testspiel-gegen-Agyptens-Olympia-Auswahl |title=Cheerful test match against Egypt's Olympics selection ends 3:4 (Translation) |language=de |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |date=16 March 2012 |author=Caspar Marti |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.&lt;ref name="Georges Küng"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/basel-stadt/fc-basel-verpflichtet-den-aegyptischen-jungstar-mohamed-salah-124081175 |title=FC Basel commit to young Egyptian star Mohamed Salah (Translation) |language=de |newspaper=Basellandschaftliche Zeitung |date=10 April 2012 |author=Georges Küng |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/53/38929/Sports/Talents-Abroad/Egypt-rising-star-Salah-officially-joins-FC-Basel.aspx |title=Egypt rising star Salah officially joins FC Basel |newspaper=Al-Ahram |year=2012 |author=Ahmed Abd El Rasoul |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kingfut.com/2018/02/13/former-basel-president-salah/ |title=Former Basel President recalls watching Salah live for first time |publisher=KingFut |date=13 February 2018 |author=Abdelrahman Amr |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February, Salah made his debut for Chelsea in the [[Premier League]], coming on as a substitute in the 3–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/chelsea-vs-newcastle/287527 |title=Premier League {{!}} Chelsea 3–0 Newcastle|publisher=Sky Sports|date=8 February 2014|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March, Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in the London Derby, coming on as a substitute for [[Oscar (footballer born 1991)|Oscar]], in a match which ended with a 6–0 win for the Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26590673 |title=Chelsea 6–0 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 March 2014 |author=Aimee Lewis |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April, Salah opened the scoring and later won a penalty and an assist in Chelsea's 3–0 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2014/04/06/match-report--chelsea-3-stoke-city-0 |title=Match Report: Chelsea 3 Stoke City 0 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohamed Salah with Chelsea - Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Salah playing for Chelsea away at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] on 1 January 2015]]

Before the [[2014–15 Chelsea F.C. season|2014–15 season]], Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in a balance after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2014/07/19/chelsea-midfielder-mohamed-salah-could-be-forced-into-military-service-by-egyptian-government-4803656/ |title=Chelsea midfielder Mohamed Salah 'could be forced into military service by Egyptian government' |newspaper=Metro |date=19 July 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was spared of military service after the meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education and the Egyptian national manager [[Shawky Gharib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/mohamed-salah-will-not-have-to-serve-military-service-after-the-egyptian-prime-minister-steps-in-to-solve-chelsea-midfielders-travel-issue--reports-9618033.html |title=Mohamed Salah: Chelsea midfielder will NOT have to serve military service after Egyptian Prime Minister steps |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 July 2014 |author=Jack de Menezes |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by [[Eden Hazard]] changing to number 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2014/08/15/squad-number-changes |title=Squad Number Changes |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salah was rarely used during the season. On 28 October 2014, in a 2–1 win at [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the fourth round of the League Cup, he took a shot that went so far off target that it went for a throw-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/making-mohamed-salah-no-stage-did-i-believe-i-didnt-belong-level-absolutely-not |title=The making of Mohamed Salah: "At no stage did I believe I didn’t belong at this level.

'''Daniel Andre Sturridge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌr|ɪ|dʒ}}; born 1 September 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]]. 

Born in [[Birmingham]], Sturridge spent four years in the [[Aston Villa Under-21s and Academy|Aston Villa academy]] before moving to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. He then signed for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two [[FA Youth Cup]] finals. He made his first-team debut in the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]], becoming the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, [[FA Cup]] and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 and signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], where he was loaned out to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for the second half of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]]. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]].

===Manchester City===
From the start of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season, Sturridge began to train with the City first team. A [[hat-trick]] in a reserve match was rewarded by a place on the substitutes' bench for the senior team's match with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in February 2007.&lt;ref name=mcfcprofile/&gt; He duly made his debut from the bench, replacing [[Georgios Samaras]] for the final quarter-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Culley |first=John |title=Manchester City 0 Reading 2: Lita strikes twice to disprove Pearce's doubts |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-0-reading-2-lita-strikes-twice-to-disprove-pearces-doubts-435128.html |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a second substitute appearance a month later, but then suffered a hip injury which sidelined him for the remainder of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Chris |title=Daniel's despair after hip op |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/daniels-despair-after-hip-op-1004101 |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2012, Sturridge was named in [[Stuart Pearce]]'s 18-man squad for the Great Britain Olympic football team to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pearce names squad |url=http://www1.skysports.com/olympics/story/15234/7859286 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721195910/http://www1.skysports.com/olympics/story/15234/7859286 |archivedate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however, announced on 3 July 2012 that Sturridge was undergoing tests for suspected [[meningitis]], and was possibly going to be unable to compete in the GB 2012 team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/03/london-2012-daniel-sturridge-team-gb?newsfeed=true |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=London 2012: Daniel Sturridge may have to withdraw from Team GB |accessdate=3 July 2012 |first=Owen |last=Gibson |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made a full recovery meaning he could take part and he scored his first goal for Great Britain in the second group match, a 3–1 victory over the [[United Arab Emirates national under-23 football team|United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4461659/Great-Britain-3-UAE-1.html |title=Great Britain 3 UAE 1 |newspaper=The Sun |date=30 July 2012 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Kastrinakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final group match, Sturridge scored the only goal as Great Britain defeated [[Uruguay Olympic football team|Uruguay]] to finish top of their group and progress to the quarter-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/football/9445523/London-2012-Olympics-Great-Britain-1-Uruguay-0-match-report.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: Great Britain 1 Uruguay 0 – Match report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1 August 2012 |first=Henry |last=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the quarter-final match against [[South Korea national under-23 football team|South Korea]], Sturridge missed the fifth penalty for Great Britain.

====2014 FIFA World Cup====
In May 2014, Sturridge was named in England's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and assigned the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/may/world-cup-squad-numbers-announced-210514 |title=England's World Cup squad numbers confirmed |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the team's opening goal in a 3–0 friendly defeat of [[Peru national football team|Peru]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 30 May.&lt;ref name="England 3–0 Peru"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 3–0 Peru |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27383301 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June, Sturridge started England's opening match of the tournament and scored the team's goal in a 2–1 defeat by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Manaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/england-italy-world-cup-2014-group-d-match-report |title=Italy's Mario Balotelli leaves England's Group D hopes in the balance |date=15 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UEFA Euro 2016====
Despite injury keeping him out of most of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification]] phase, Sturridge was named in England's squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] finals. In the team's second group match, after appearing as a half time substitute against [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Sturridge assisted [[Jamie Vardy]]'s equaliser and scored the winning goal as the team recovered from a 1–0 deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/england-wales-euro-2016-match-report |title=Euro 2016: Sturridge leaves it late as England come back to beat Wales |date=16 June 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Sturridge v Stoke City 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Sturridge playing for Liverpool in 2013]]

Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said, "Daniel offers a few of the characteristics I had with [[Hulk (footballer)|Hulk]] when I was with him in [[FC Porto|Porto]]... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/8801185/Chelsea-manager-Andre-Villas-Boas-says-Daniel-Sturridge-is-a-really-big-talent-ahead-of-Bolton-Wandrerers-test.html |title=Sturridge 'a really big talent' |accessdate=1 October 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Duncan |last=White |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturridge said he preferred to play as a centre-forward rather than as a wide player: "I do still see myself as a striker but I am doing a job for the team and I'm enjoying doing it." As Sturridge transitioned from a wider role into a striker when he joined Liverpool, Sturridge also said that he likens himself on striker [[Thierry Henry]], who "played wide for Juventus and then went to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and played as a centre-forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7595924/Sturridge-I-m-a-striker |title=Sturridge – I'm a striker |accessdate=14 March 2012 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he rarely played for Chelsea as a striker, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers played Sturridge as a striker in most matches. His ability to still drop between lines and pull wide and attack defences, similar to former strike partner Luis Suárez's playing-style, has led to Rodgers describing him as "what I call a '[[Forward (association football)#Second striker|nine-and-a-half]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/brendan-rodgers-willing-to-tinker-with-liverpool-formation-to-exploit-the-strengths-of-our-players-8859191.html |title=Brendan Rodgers willing to tinker with Liverpool formation to 'exploit the strengths of our players' |accessdate=4 October 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |first=Carl |last=Markham |date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside of football==
===Personal life===
Sturridge is the son of former footballer [[Mike Sturridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dan Sturridge Uses Father's Pride As Inspiration Source For Achivement At Chelsea |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2009/12/26/1709809/dan-sturridge-uses-fathers-pride-as-inspiration-source-for |website=Goal.com |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nephew of former footballers [[Dean Sturridge|Dean]] and [[Simon Sturridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daniel Sturridge: 'I'm aiming for the stars.

But once Dean left, Sturridge switched his allegiance to Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratna |first1=Hitesh |title=Daniel Sturridge: Talentspotter |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/daniel-sturridge-talentspotter |website=FourFourTwo |accessdate=16 June 2017 |date=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturridge is a Christian. After winning the Premier League Player of the Month award, Sturridge said, "I do all [through] [[Jesus|Christ]] who strengthens me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=DanielSturridge |author=Daniel Sturridge |number=378554379328323585 |date=13 September 2013 |title=I do all trough Christ who strengthens me.

'''Alberto Moreno Pérez''' ({{IPA-es|alˈβeɾto moˈɾeno ˈpeɾeθ}}; born 5 July 1992) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]].

An academy graduate of local side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], he made his senior debut for the club's reserve side in 2011 before going on to feature in 62 official games for the first team. During his time with Sevilla, he was part of the squad which won the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] title in 2014. The following season, he joined [[Premier League]] club Liverpool for a reported fee of £12 million where he has since made over 100 appearances and collected runners-up medals in the [[EFL Cup]], Europa League and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

Moreno was part of the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain under-21 team]] that won the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2013 UEFA European Championship]] and made his [[Spain national football team|senior]] debut the same year.

==Club career==

=== Sevilla ===
Moreno was born in the [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] capital of [[Seville]] and at the age of 13 joined his local side, [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberto Moreno: Sevilla is my home but I want to win|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2016/05/17/573afbdd22601de0048b45b0.html|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=Marca|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ff2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/alberto-moreno-prem-bound-la-liga-left-back-who-bettered-gareth-bale|title=Alberto Moreno: The Prem-bound La Liga left-back who bettered Gareth Bale|publisher=Four Four Two|last=Wilkes|first=Paul|date=13 April 2014|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he progressed through the club's youth academy and made his senior debut for the reserve side, [[Sevilla Atlético]], on 12 June 2011 in a 3–1 home win over [[CD Guadalajara (Spain)|Guadalajara]] in the [[Segunda División B]] play-offs. The club ultimately lost 5–4 on aggregate, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Sevilla Atlético roza la remontada|trans-title=Sevilla Atlético grind a comeback|url=http://www.marca.com/2011/06/12/futbol/mas_futbol/1307914535.html|accessdate=12 April 2016|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|date=12 June 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[2011–12 Segunda División B|first full season]] followed thereafter during which he scored four goals in 30 games, including his first senior goal directly from a [[corner kick]] in added time against [[Cádiz CF|Cádiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victoria del Sevilla Atlético sobre el Cádiz con gol olímpico de Alberto|trans-title=Victory for Sevilla Atlético over Cádiz with an Olympic goal by Alberto|url=http://sevilla.eldesmarque.com/sevilla-futbol-club/41927-victoria-del-sevilla-atletico-sobre-el-cadiz-con-gol-olimpico-de-alberto|accessdate=12 April 2016|publisher=El Desmarque|date=13 November 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst playing for the reserve side, Moreno operated under the tutelage of Ramón Tejada who rotated him between attacking and defensive positions down the left-flank of the field.&lt;ref name=ff2/&gt; The positional rotation was later credited for his tactical awareness which contributed to him making his first team, and [[La Liga]] debut.&lt;ref name=ff2/&gt; This took place on 8 April 2012 when he came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Manu del Moral]] in the last minutes of a 1–0 away loss against [[Athletic Bilbao]].&lt;ref name=ff2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/323747/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739 "Llorente leads Leones to victory"].

In February 2013, Moreno was permanently promoted to the first team and he scored his first professional goal on 20 October, netting the second in a 2–2 draw at [[Real Valladolid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligabbva.com/3208_sevilla/1977189_alberto-moreno-reconoce-que-vive-en-una-pompa-de-jabon-en-el-primer-equipo.html|title=Alberto Moreno reconoce que vive "en una pompa de jabón" en el primer equipo |trans-title=Alberto Moreno acknowledges living in "a bubble" in first team|publisher=La Liga|language=Spanish|date=20 March 2013|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/373135/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null |title=Valladolid snatch unlikely draw |publisher=ESPN FC |date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=25 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223215037/http://espnfc.com/en/report/373135/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null |archivedate=23 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately made 17 appearances during a campaign blemished only by a straight red card he received following a confrontation with [[Gabi (footballer)|Gabi]] inn a league match against [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlético Madrid 1–1 Sevilla|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25717734|accessdate=12 April 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9330407/transfer-news-liverpool-make-offer-for-sevilla-left-back-alberto-moreno|title=Transfer news: Liverpool linked with Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno|publisher=Sky Sports|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed a breakthrough season in the [[2013–14 La Liga|2013–14 campaign]] where he made 44 appearances in total for the club, including 14 in Sevilla's [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|victorious run]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref name=ss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/28822500|title=Alberto Moreno completes £12m Liverpool move from Sevilla|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Smith|first=Ben|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances throughout the season also contributed towards Sevilla ending the fifth in the league and earned him a spot in [[Spain national football team|Spain]]'s provisional squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=ss/&gt;

On 12 August 2014, and on the eve of Sevilla's [[2014 UEFA Super Cup]] match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], Moreno was withdrawn from the club's match-day squad after the club agreed a £12 million deal with [[Premier League]] side [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for his signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberto Moreno: Liverpool agree £12m fee with Sevilla for defender|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28765444|publisher=BBC|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the match, Moreno was in tears and had to be consoled as he was given a send off by the club's fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-bound-alberto-moreno-bids-emotional-4042968|title=Liverpool-bound Alberto Moreno bids emotional farewell to Sevilla team-mates after Super Cup defeat|publisher=Daily Mirror|last=Prendenerville|first=Liam|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained that he was emotional to be leaving Sevilla as the club was the "club of his life" but that he was equally motivated to succeed at Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/alberto-moreno-to-liverpool-defender-admits-it-has-been-emotional-leaving-seville-but-is-super-9667012.html|title=

===Liverpool===
On 16 August 2014, Moreno officially completed his move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and he made his debut for the club 10 days later in a 3–1 league loss to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberto Moreno completes £12m Liverpool move from Sevilla|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28822500|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Henry|title=Manchester City 3 Liverpool 1: Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Agüero on target as Premier League champions secure win|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/11055354/Manchester-City-3-Liverpool-1-Stevan-Jovetic-and-Sergio-Aguero-on-target-as-Premier-League-champions-secure-win.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=25 August 2014|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored his first goal on 31 August, netting the third goal in 3–0 away win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] after dispossessing [[Andros Townsend]] and sprinting 40 yards to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28917060 |title=Tottenham Hotspur 0-3 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/liverpool-tottenham-alberto-moreno-goal |title=Alberto Moreno’s first goal for Liverpool was spectacular |newspaper=USA Today |location=Tysons Corner |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again in December, against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], but ultimately endured an inconsistent debut season at [[Anfield]], with his attacking output not matched by his defensive performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bascombe |first=Chris |title=Liverpool 4 Swansea City 1: Adam Lallana shows his class as Liverpool cruise to victory |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/11316920/Liverpool-4-Swansea-City-1-Adam-Lallana-shows-his-class-as-Liverpool-cruise-to-victory.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=30 December 2014 |date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisanfield.com/2015/06/alberto-moreno-201415-season-review-wayward-first-season-spanish-left-back/|title=Alberto Moreno 2014/15 Season Review: A difficult first season for the Spanish left-back|publisher=This is Anfield|last=Lusby|first=Jack|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=8 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno spent the first four games of the [[2015–16 Liverpool F.C. season|next season]] as a substitute as new teammate [[Joe Gomez (footballer)|Joe Gomez]] started in his position. However, on 20 September 2015, he made his first league start of the season, providing the assist for [[Danny Ings]]' first Liverpool goal in a 1–1 draw against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jennings|first=Patrick|title=Liverpool 1 - 1 Norwich City|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34236959|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was praised for his man of the match performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usher|first1=David|title=Simon Mignolet's errors undoes Danny Ings' impact for Liverpool|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/liverpool/364/blog/post/2622929/simon-mignolets-errors-undoes-danny-ings-liverpool-impact|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance in the [[2016 UEFA Europa League Final]], where Liverpool lost 1–3 to his former club Sevilla, was heavily criticised by pundits and journalists for positioning and defensive errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prentice|first=David|title=Moreno slammed by McManaman and Owen for second-half display|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alberto-moreno-europa-league-final-11354159l|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|location=Liverpool|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mariner|first1=James|title=Liverpool 1 Sevilla 3: Jamie Carragher deletes Twitter message slagging off Alberto Moreno|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/carragher-tweets-message-slagging-off-moreno-before-deleting-it-a7037036.html|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=The Independent|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Ian|title=Liverpool 1-3 Sevilla player ratings: 4-4-2...not a formation but the three worst performances|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-1-3-sevilla-player-11354169|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was Alberto Moreno's Europa League horror show the biggest individual nightmare in a final?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/05/19/was-alberto-morenos-horror-show-for-liverpool-against-sevilla-th/alberto-moreno/|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Europa League final: What next for Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36326487|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spartak Moscow- Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Moreno (bottom-left) lining-up for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in 2017.]]
On 14 August 2016, Moreno started in the [[2016–17 Liverpool F.C. season|first game]] of the season, a 4–3 win at Arsenal, where he conceded a penalty and was criticised heavily for his performance, prompting a defence from his manager [[Jürgen Klopp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-news-jurgen-klopp-defends-alberto-moreno-after-left-back-is-criticised-for-arsenal-a7197401.html|title=Jurgen Klopp defends Alberto Moreno after left-back is widely criticised for Arsenal performance|date=18 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his manager's intervention, he was dropped and used only as a late substitute for the next game, an 0–2 loss at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/burnley-v-liverpool-team-news-11776769|title=Moreno dropped by Jurgen Klopp|last=Pearce|first=James|date=2016-08-20|newspaper=Liverpool Echo |access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 18 appearances over the season, just eight as a starter, as [[James Milner]] was preferred in the left-back slot.&lt;ref name=Napoli&gt;{{cite news|last1=Price|first1=Glenn|title=Liverpool reject €12.5m Napoli bid for Alberto Moreno - source|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3146998/liverpool-reject-napoli-bid-for-alberto-moreno-source|accessdate=22 June 2017|publisher=ESPN FC|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, [[Serie A]] teams [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]] spoke to Liverpool about a transfer for Moreno, and in June the Reds rejected a €12.5 million bid for him from another Italian club, [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref name=Napoli/&gt;

Moreno represented the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spanish under-21s]] at the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2013 UEFA European Championship]], being first-choice as he helped them [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship Final|retain their European title]].

Lallana joined the first team squad in July 2006, making his debut on 23 August 2006, in a 5–2 victory over [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]], in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/5266330.stm |title=Southampton 5–2 Yeovil |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October 2006 he signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lallana signs new deal |publisher=Southampton F.C. |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7672 |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091417/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7672 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2007 he joined Bournemouth on loan for one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lallana on loan |publisher=Southampton F.C. |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=9101 |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2008, Lallana scored his first professional goal for Southampton against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in a crucial Championship match, with a well-placed finish into the bottom left corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7356066.stm |title=West Brom 1–1 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Lallana was subject to interest from Premier League runners-up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. After long periods of negotiation Liverpool placed a reported £25&amp;nbsp;million bid which was accepted by Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool bid for Lallana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/01/adam-lallana-move-southampton-liverpool |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following England's return from the World Cup, Lallana signed for Liverpool, and was handed the number 20 shirt, the number he wore during his time at Southampton. Bournemouth, Lallana's youth team, had originally included a 25% sell-on-clause in his contract when he joined Southampton, but only received £4&amp;nbsp;million after agreeing to a reduced fee with Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bournemouth owner explains Lallana sell on clause |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11312797.AFC_Bournemouth__Blake_reveals__small_sacrifices__over_Lallana_deal |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adam Lallana: Liverpool sign Southampton captain for £25m |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27647888 |accessdate=1 July 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Sint-Truiden===
Mignolet was born in [[Sint-Truiden]]. He first joined his local football team, [[Belgian Second Division]] side [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]], in 2004, eventually rising through their youth system to become their first-choice goalkeeper in 2006 at age 18 after the departure of [[Dušan Belić]]. In 2009, he made 29 appearances and scored a penalty in the league, as he helped Sint-Truiden to win the [[Belgian Second Division]], and was named [[Belgian professional football awards|Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year]] the following year after he helped Sint-Truiden avoid relegation.

===Sunderland===

After being invited for a training ground tour, Mignolet signed a five-year contract with English [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 17 June 2010 in a deal worth £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/17/sunderland-sign-simon-mignolet|title=Sunderland sign Belgium Under-21 goalkeeper Simon Mignolet|date=17 June 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619141456/http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |title=Mignolet on dream move |publisher=Sunderland A.F.C |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |archivedate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed by Sint-Truiden that Sunderland had beaten [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Twente|Twente]] and [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] to secure Mignolet's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2010/03/29/1854728/there-has-been-no-contact-between-psv-and-simon-mignolet|title=FINISHED: No Contact Yet Between PSV And Simon Mignolet|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mignolet made his Sunderland debut in a 2–2 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 15 August 2010, and was named man of the match for his performance. In the next home match, a 1–0 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Mignolet kept his first clean sheet for Sunderland, following an excellent reaction save to deny [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] a goal. Mignolet put in another fine performance against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as Sunderland drew 1–1 after [[Darren Bent]] equalised in the 95th minute. However, [[Craig Gordon]] would replace Mignolet in goal several weeks later, and remained first-choice thereafter. Mignolet did not feature again until 8 January 2011, when Sunderland suffered a loss at home to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]]. Mignolet would become first-choice goalkeeper again after a knee injury to Gordon in February, and earned a string of rave reviews for his performances.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Following the draw, Sunderland manager [[Steve Bruce]] hailed the young goalkeeper's fine start to life in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/03/05/2380907/sunderland-boss-steve-bruce-hails-performance-of-goalkeeper|title=Sunderland boss Steve Bruce hails performance of goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after draw with Arsenal - Goal.com|date=5 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mignolet cemented his position as first-choice goalkeeper the following season, being preferred to new signing [[Keiren Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8695430/Liverpool-1-Sunderland-1-match-report.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rory | last=Smith | title=Liverpool 1 Sunderland 1: match report | date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2011, Mignolet was injured during a 2–2 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], suffering a broken nose following a collision with [[Emile Heskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/7281455/Mignolet-suffers-broken-nose |title=Mignolet suffers broken nose |publisher=Sky Sports |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2014, Mignolet's run of 53 consecutive Premier League starts came to an end as he was replaced by [[Brad Jones (footballer)|Brad Jones]] in the starting 11 against Manchester United, with Brendan Rodgers saying Mignolet would be dropped for an "indefinite period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester United 3 Liverpool 0, match report: David de Gea the Old Trafford hero as rivals are swept aside|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/11293000/Manchester-United-3-Liverpool-0-match-report-David-de-Gea-the-Old-Trafford-hero-as-rivals-are-swept-aside.html|accessdate=14 December 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 12 days later, Jones went off injured after 16 minutes away at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and despite some errors, Mignolet kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Neil|title=Burnley 0–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544290|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this match, Mignolet kept four consecutive clean sheets against Sunderland, Aston Villa, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and Everton respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30257075|title=Sunderland 0–1 Liverpool|date=10 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30758464|title=Aston Villa 0–2 Liverpool|date=17 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30963476|title=Liverpool 2–0 West Ham|date=31 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31071270|title=Everton 0–0 Liverpool|date=7 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, Mignolet made some outstanding saves against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 3–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31106342|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March, Mignolet continued his resurgence in a 1–0 victory against Swansea, keeping a clean sheet as part of a strong performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31792005|title=Swansea City 0–1 Liverpool|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March, he saved a penalty taken by [[Wayne Rooney]] in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 1–2 Manchester United|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31893202|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xherdan Shaqiri''' ({{IPA-sq|dʒɛrˈdan ʃaˈciɾi}}; born 10 October 1991) is a Swiss professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national team]].

He began his career at [[FC Basel]], winning honours including three [[Swiss Super League]] titles, before moving to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], where he gained eight domestic and international honours despite playing less frequently. In January 2015, he moved to [[Inter Milan]] for a fee of €15&amp;nbsp;million, and seven months later to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for a club record £12&amp;nbsp;million. After Stoke's relegation from the Premier League in [[2017–18 Premier League|2018]], Shaqiri was transferred to Liverpool prior to the following season for a reported £13.5&amp;nbsp;million fee.

A full international since 2010, Shaqiri has earned over 70 caps and scored over 20 goals for Switzerland. He represented the nation at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]s, as well as [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/balkan-imports-hitting-big-time-as-switzerland-establish-themselves-as-world-cup-regulars-1.262390|title=Balkan imports hitting big time as Switzerland establish themselves as World Cup regulars|newspaper=The National|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shaqiri was born in [[Gjilan]], SFR Yugoslavia, to [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanian]] parents.&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=321653/profile-detail.html|title=Xherdan SHAQIRI|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballtop.com/players/xherdan-shaqiri|title=Xherdan Shaqiri biography|publisher=FootballTop.com|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Switzerland in 1992 with his parents and three siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/article18891.html|title=Football : Xherdan Shaqiri, le meilleur ambassadeur suisse du Kosovo|newspaper=Le Courrier des Balkans|date=22 December 2012|language=French|accessdate=15 August 2013|first=Simon|last=Rico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720041647/http://balkans.courriers.info/article18891.html|archive-date=20 July 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in [[Augst]], a small town in the canton of [[Canton of Basel-Landschaft|Basel-Country]], near the French and German borders.&lt;ref name=jill&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zimmerli |first1=Jill |title=World Cup 2014: Switzerland profile – Xherdan Shaqiri |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/03/world-cup-2014-switzerland-profile-xherdan-shaqiri |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father did not speak Swiss German, so he had to start out washing dishes in a restaurant, before working construction on roads. His mother worked as a cleaner in office buildings in the city, which he and his brothers helped with. His father would send as much money back to Kosovo to other family members as he could, meaning Xherdan and the family did not have extra spending money, except for birthdays.&lt;ref name="Background"/&gt; He idolized Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who he said played "like magic".&lt;ref name="Background"&gt;{{cite news |title=Xherdan Shaqiri's incredible life story in his own words: from Kosovo to World Cup star|url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/xherdan-shaqiri-stoke-liverpool-transfer-1712944 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Stoke Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===FC Basel===
Shaqiri started his career at hometown club SV Augst, and at the age of eight he was scouted by [[FC Basel]].&lt;ref name=jill/&gt; Whilst playing for Basel's youth team, he competed in the Under-15 Nike Cup 2007 and was named the best player of the tournament. Despite having several other clubs attempting to sign him, he decided to stay with Basel, where he played for their reserve team from 2007 to 2009 in the [[1. Liga Classic|Swiss 1. Liga]]. Two years later, Shaqiri signed his first professional contract with Basel on 2 January 2009,&lt;ref name="fcb 2009-01-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/-/21575/27/7/7|title=Dreijahres-Profivertrag für Xherdan Shaqiri|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=2 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2014|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201180900/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/-/21575/27/7/7|archive-date=1 February 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the new contract keeping him at [[St. Jakob-Park]] until June 2014.

Shaqiri made his Basel club debut as a substitute on 12 July 2009 in Basel's [[2009–10 Swiss Super League|2009–10 season]] opening match against [[FC St. Gallen]] at the [[AFG Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22517/16/7|title=St. Gallen 2 – Basel 0|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141819/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22517/16/7 |archivedate=16 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later he scored his first goal for Basel in a 4–1 win over [[Neuchâtel Xamax]] at home on 9 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/23275/16/7|title=Basel 4 – Xamax 1|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141425/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/23275/16/7 |archivedate=16 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[2009–10 Swiss Super League|2009–10]] season Shaqiri won the national [[Double (association football)|Double]] with Basel, and a year later won the League title again.

In December 2011, Shaqiri provided two assists in a match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with Basel winning 2–1.&lt;ref name="Manu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08122011/58/champions-league-stunned-united-crash-defeat-basel.html|title=Champions League – Stunned United crash out after defeat at Basel|publisher=Yahoo!

=== Senior ===

==== UEFA Euro 2012 ====
Shaqiri was promoted to the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss senior team]] in 2010, making his debut on 3 March 2010 in a 3–1 friendly loss against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was included in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] squad, after receiving a surprise call-up from manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]]. Shaqiri scored his first goal for them on 7 September 2010, a long range left-footed shot, in a 1–3 loss against [[England national football team|England]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|Euro 2012 qualifier]]. He netted a hat-trick in another Euro 2012 qualifier on 6 September 2011, as Switzerland came from behind to beat [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15171/match=2002282/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Shaqiri treble keeps Swiss hopes alive|publisher=UEFA|date=6 September 2011|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland also tried to select him to participate in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympic Football tournament]], but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/09/oly-socc-swiss-squad-idUSB29215720120709|title=Olympics-Shaqiri, Xhaka excluded from Swiss soccer squad|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=26 July 2012|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2014 FIFA World Cup ====
On 11 September 2012, Shaqiri did not sing the [[Swiss national anthem]] in a World Cup qualifier against his ancestral [[Albania national football team|Albania]] in [[Lucerne]], and did not celebrate when he scored the opening goal of a 2–0 win. He wore boots with the flags of Kosovo, Albania and Switzerland for the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montague|first=James|title=Rooting for Home, if Not Yet a Home Team|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/sports/soccer/kosovo-wants-a-national-soccer-team-and-to-call-its-players-home.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Shaqiri was named in Switzerland's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. In the team's opening match, Shaqiri was named man of the match by [[FIFA]] as the ''Nati'' defeated [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255931/match=300186494/index.html#nosticky|title=Switzerland 2–1 Ecuador|accessdate=16 June 2014|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the same title a mere ten days later in the Swiss team's third and final group match, scoring a hat-trick against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], which included a bending strike from 30 yards, to ensure Switzerland a spot in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup#Round of 16|round of 16]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2668450/Honduras-vs-Switzerland-World-Cup-2014-LIVE-Follow-action-Group-E.html|title=Honduras 0–3 Switzerland World Cup 2014 MATCH REPORT: Xherdan Shaqiri scores a hat-trick to secure Swiss progress|newspaper=Daily Mail|first=Elliott|last=Bretland|date=25 June 2014|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they 1–0 lost to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/27990606|title=Argentina 1–0 Switzerland (aet)|date=1 July 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UEFA Euro 2016 ====

Following Switzerland's first game at Euro 2016, Shaqiri declared he would switch allegiance to [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]] if their manager would make him captain, in reaction to Swiss manager [[Vladimir Petković]]'s decision to omit him from that position. Although already an international for the Swiss, FIFA rules would permit Shaqiri to represent Kosovo, who joined the federation earlier that year.&lt;ref name="FIFAA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hytner|first=David|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/14/euro-2016-xherdan-shaqiri-switzerland-romania|title=Xherdan Shaqiri drops a bombshell as Swiss prepare for Romania|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Shaqiri continued to play for Switzerland after Kosovo had become a member of FIFA, it also ruled out the possibility of Shaqiri's eligibility to Kosovo.&lt;ref name=FIFAA&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2016/m=9/news=change-of-association-to-the-football-federation-of-kosovo-2831273.html|title=Change of association to the Football Federation of Kosovo|date=7 September 2016|accessdate=24 June 2018|publisher=FIFA|quote=In particular, the Bureau of the Players' Status Committee wished to emphasise that the players concerned had not represented their previous association after 13 May 2016, the date of admission of the FFK to FIFA. In other words, they never chose to play for their previous association when they had the opportunity to choose to play for the representative teams of the FFK. The Bureau of the Players’ Status Committee indicated that this was a key element in its decision on the matter. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2018 FIFA World Cup ====
Shaqiri was included in Switzerland's 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], held in Russia. In the group stage, he scored the winning goal as the Swiss came from behind to defeat [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] 2–1. He and fellow goalscorer [[Granit Xhaka]], who is also of Kosovar descent, [[Goal celebration|celebrated their goals]] by making an [[Crossed hands (gesture)|eagle gesture]], a symbol of ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Sid|title=Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri stuns Serbia with late breakaway|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/22/serbia-switzerland-xherdan-shaqiri-world-cup-group-e-match-report|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 June 2018|accessdate=22 June 2018|quote=As he turned and screamed, he took his shirt off, flexed his muscles and performed a double-eagle celebration, a recreation of the Albanian flag.

'''Rhian Joel Brewster''' (born 1 April 2000) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[England national under-18 football team|England U18]] national team. In 2017, he was part of the England squad which won the [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] and was awarded the Golden Boot award for ending as the competition's leading goalscorer.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born and raised in the [[London]] area, Brewster attended school at Chadwell Heath Primary School before joining the Chadwell Heath and Shield Football academies.&lt;ref name=never&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41753629|title=Rhian Brewster: 'I've never seen a player like him before'|date=25 October 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Chowdhury|first=Saj|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, he was scouted by representatives from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]]. He ultimately joined Chelsea where he developed his game under coach Michael Beale in [[Chelsea F.C. Under-23s and Academy|the club's academy]] until the age of 14, whereafter he left to join [[Premier League]] rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=never/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/rhian-brewster-england-liverpool-under-17-world-cup-final|title=Rhian Brewster: England U17’s natural finisher on the fast-track at Liverpool|website=Guardian|last=Hunter|first=Andy|date=26 October 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
In 2015, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] signed Brewster from Chelsea following a recommendation by Beale who had taken up a position with the club. Brewster's decision to make the move was motivated in part by his father's influence who believed that he had a better chance of breaking through to the first team through Liverpool's academy than Chelsea's.&lt;ref name=never/&gt;&lt;ref name=TIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisanfield.com/2017/01/rhian-brewster-liverpool-academy-forward-set-breakthrough-2017/|title=Rhian Brewster: Liverpool academy forward set for a breakthrough 2017|website=This is Anfield|last=Lusby|first=Jack|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rhian-brewster-who-liverpool-youngster-11979122|title=Rhian Brewster&amp;nbsp;— who is the Liverpool youngster who scored five in two games for England?|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially joined the club's U18 side before being promoted to the U23 squad, where he scored on his debut against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-youngster-rhian-brewster-snubbing-12698860|title=Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster on snubbing Chelsea, sleepless nights and being inspired by Suarez|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the club's academy, Brewster was placed on a special training regime which included one-on-one sessions with former Liverpool and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] winger, [[Steve McManaman]].&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

Brewster was then called up by [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Jürgen Klopp]] to the first-team for club [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendlies]] in October and November 2016 during which he scored a [[hat-trick]] against [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]].&lt;ref name=TIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/gomez-ends-liverpool-injury-nightmare-12169550|title=Gomez ends Liverpool injury nightmare|first=Andy|last=Kelly|date=13 November 2016|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, he was named on the bench for Liverpool's [[Premier League]] game against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 23 April 2017, but remained an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39612237|title=Liverpool 1–2 Crystal Palace|date=23 April 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, during Liverpool's [[UEFA Youth League]] match against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], Brewster was the victim of alleged racist comments from Spartak's captain, [[Leonid Mironov]]. An investigation into the incident was opened by [[UEFA]] after the match and Brewster later said in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' that it had been the seventh such instance he had experienced, including once before against the same opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa|title=Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster: ‘When I’m racially abused, I just want to be left alone’|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|work=The Guardian|date=28 December 2017|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhian Brewster: England and Liverpool striker alleges racial abuse|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42511863|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA later ruled that there was insufficient evidence to take further action against Mironov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-praise-rhian-brewster-courage-14379583|title=Liverpool praise Rhian Brewster for courage during UEFA investigation|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2018, during an U23 match against [[Manchester City F.C. EDS and Academy|Manchester City]], Brewster received oxygen and had to be stretchered off the field after landing awkwardly following an aerial challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rhian-brewster-stretchered-during-liverpool-14150160|title=Rhian Brewster stretchered off during Liverpool U23s match against Man City|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Jones|first=Adam|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later diagnosed with a [[Sprained ankle|high ankle sprain]] and related ligament damage and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-striker-rhian-brewster-confirmed-14156981|title=Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster confirmed with ligament damage|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/highly-rated-liverpool-striker-rhian-14203567|title=Highly-rated Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster likely to miss rest of the season|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he had to undergo a second operation in order to repair damage to his knee which he sustained during the same incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-youngster-rhian-brewster-undergoes-14380383|title=Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster undergoes second operation on ankle injury|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Towards the end of the season, Brewster was the subject of intense transfer speculation which culminated in Liverpool cancelling a scheduled friendly against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] after the German club were alleged to have [[Tapping up|tapped]] him up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11378817/liverpool-cancel-borussia-m246nchengladbach-game-over-rhian-brewster|title=Liverpool cancel Borussia Mönchengladbach game over Rhian Brewster|publisher=Sky Sports|date=19 May 2018|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Robertson''' (born 11 March 1994) is a Scottish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and captains the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]].

Robertson began his senior career with [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] in 2012 before joining [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] a year later. His form in his first season as a professional led to him being named [[SPFA Young Player of the Year]] and also making his international debut. He joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in July 2014 for a fee of £2.85&amp;nbsp;million, before joining Liverpool in July 2017 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be an initial £8&amp;nbsp;million. 

Robertson made his full international debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in May 2014, and he was appointed [[list of Scotland national football team captains|Scotland captain]] in September 2018.

==Early life and career==
Robertson was born in [[Glasgow]]. He attended [[St Ninian's High School, Giffnock|St Ninian's High School]] in [[Giffnock]], East Renfrewshire, from 2006 to 2012, where he captained the football team. He also played for Giffnock Soccer Centre and joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a youth, but was released at under-15 level because he was considered to be too small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dundee-united-starlet-andy-roberston-2900858|title=Dundee United starlet Andy Roberston: Celtic made a small blunder the day they let me go|work=Daily Record|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then signed for [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].

==Club career==

===Queen's Park===
Focusing on his studies, Robertson was on the brink of starting university at undergraduate degree level before he was called up to the Queen's Park first team at the beginning of the [[2012–13 in Scottish football|2012–13 season]]. He made his debut for the club in the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]], in a penalty shoot out win against [[Berwick Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19027896 |title=Ramsdens Cup: Berwick Rangers 2–2 Queen's Park (aet, 2–3 pens) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make a total of forty appearances during the season,&lt;ref name="Andrew Robertson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=124&amp;ID=415|title=Andrew Robertson|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=5 August 2013}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping the club to a third-place finish in the [[2012-13 Scottish Third Division|Scottish Third Division]]. His first goal for the club came in a 2–1 defeat to [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] on 13 November 2012.&lt;ref name="Andrew Robertson"/&gt;

===Dundee United===
Robertson signed for [[Scottish Premiership]] side [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], along with Queen's Park teammate [[Aidan Connolly]], on 3 June 2013;&lt;ref name="Dundee United sign Robertson and Connolly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22762888|title=Dundee Utd sign Queen's Park's Robertson and Connolly|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=3 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; he took the squad place of the departing [[Barry Douglas]] who had made the same move three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/news/2895/BARRY-DOUGLAS-JOINS-UNITED.html|author=|title= Barry Douglas joins United|work=|date=21 June 2010|publisher= [[Dundee United F.C.]] |accessdate=9 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having being ignored in their requests for a transfer fee for Douglas, Queen's Park (an amateur club) protested at the prospect of more players departing to United for nothing and eventually agreed a deal involving a percentage of future transfers, which would later prove beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13172018.300k-robertson-boost-a-cut-above-for-queens-park/|author=|title= £300k Robertson boost a cut above for Queen's Park|work=The Herald |date=27 July 2014|publisher= |accessdate=9 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson immediately became part of manager [[Jackie McNamara]]'s first team plans, making his debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 0–0 draw with [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. On 22 September 2013, Robertson scored his first goal for Dundee United, in a 2–2 draw against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee United 2–2 Motherwell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24098544|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran from his own half before sending a low left-foot drive in to the goal from 22 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/dundee-utd-2-2-motherwell-ainsworth-stuns-utd-1-3106278 |title=Dundee Utd 2–2 Motherwell: Ainsworth stuns Utd |newspaper= The Scotsman|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he agreed a new contract with United, until May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee secure Robertson extension|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=2&amp;nid=4617&amp;cd=2013|publisher= Dundee United F.C. |date=4 October 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted [[Scottish Professional Football League monthly awards|SPFL young player of the month]] for September 2013 and player of the month for November 2013.&lt;ref name="pom1113"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee United defender wins player award|url=http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/sport/dundee-united/dundee-united-defender-wins-player-award-1.162529|work=Evening Telegraph|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2014, Robertson played in the [[2013–14 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] Semi-final against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], which United won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangers 1–3 Dundee United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26898652|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Wilson|first=Richard|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Robertson won the [[PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year]] award&lt;ref name="ypoy14"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Celtic players make player of year shortlist|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27052382|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Robertson: Dundee United defender wins PFA prize|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27183894|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also named in the [[PFA Scotland Team of the Year]] for the [[2013–14 Scottish Premiership]].&lt;ref name="toy14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27080030|title=Celtic and Dundee United trios in SPFL Premiership team of year|date=18 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divock Okoth Origi''' ({{IPA-all|diˈvɔk ɔˈkɔθ oˈrigiː|[[Kenyan English]]:|Divock Origi pronunciation.ogg}}; born 18 April 1995) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Forward|forward]] for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. He is the son of former Kenyan professional footballer [[Mike Origi]].

Origi began his career at  [[Lille OSC|Lille]], and scored on his professional debut for them in 2013. A year and a half later, he was signed for £10&amp;nbsp;million by Liverpool, who loaned him back to Lille for the [[2014–15 Ligue 1]] season.

Origi made his international debut for Belgium in 2014, and was part of their team which reached the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], during which he became the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history.

Origi began his career playing football at [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]'s youth academy where he spent nine years before signing for [[LOSC Lille|Lille]] in May 2010, aged 15, after turning down an approach by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/origi-turning-down-manchester-united-10994105|title=Origi: Why turning down United and ending up at Liverpool was best thing for me|last=Doyle|first=Ian|website=liverpoolecho|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2014, [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] announced that they had completed a £10&amp;nbsp;million transfer for Origi, who signed a five-year contract but was immediately loaned back to Lille for the [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/167369-reds-complete-origi-deal|title=Reds complete Origi deal|date=29 July 2014|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28551650 |title=Liverpool sign Belgium striker Divock Origi from Lille for £10m |date=29 July 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729230536/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28551650 |archivedate=29 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season: Loan to Lille====
In his first match back in Lille, Origi scored his first goal of the new Ligue 1 season through a penalty against [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] to secure a 1–0 win for his side. This was after he had been brought down in the box by defender [[Dennis Appiah]], who was sent off by the referee towards the 70th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/321521/report |title=Ligue report: Lille let off the hook |date=15 August 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, as Lille lost 0–3 at home to [[VfL Wolfsburg]] to be eliminated from the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage|UEFA Europa League group stage]], Origi had a penalty saved by [[Diego Benaglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=LOSC left high and dry by Wolfsburg|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000587/match=2014565/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=UEFA|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2015, Origi scored a [[hat-trick]] for Lille in a 3–0 league win against [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/french-ligue-1/match/393429/lille-stade-rennes/report |title=Origi back with a bang in Lille win |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/feuille_match/79062 Lille 3–0 Rennais Match Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2015, Origi was named in Liverpool's 30-man squad for their pre-season tour of Thailand, Australia and Malaysia. In his non-competitive debut for Liverpool, a pre-season friendly against [[Thai Premier League All-Star Football|Thai All-Stars]] on 14 July, Origi scored his first goal for the club in a 4–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-4-0-thai-stars-9656001|title= Liverpool FC 4–0 Thai All Stars: Origi nets debut goal as monsoon fails to dampen Reds' pre-season stroll|date=14 July 2015|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first competitive game for the team was on 12 September, replacing [[Danny Ings]] for the final sixteen minutes of a 3–1 loss at [[Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Man Utd 3–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34160795|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Origi scored his first competitive Liverpool goals on 2 December, a hat-trick in a 6–1 away win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the quarter-finals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 1–6 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34918281|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven days later, he scored his first Premier League goal, replacing the injured [[Dejan Lovren]] in the 79th minute and scoring an added-time equaliser from outside the penalty area for a 2–2 draw against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Anfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawkes|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 2–2 West Brom|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35018987|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, he scored his second league goal against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a 6–0 victory, only 27 seconds after replacing [[Daniel Sturridge]] in the second half; this was the fastest goal scored by a substitute that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35515112|title=Aston Villa 0–6 Liverpool|date=14 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2016, Liverpool manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] surprisingly started Origi ahead of Sturridge (the team's first-choice striker) during Liverpool's [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League knockout phase|Europa League quarter-final]] match against [[Borussia Dortmund]], Klopp's former side. Origi scored a vital away goal in [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Borussia Dortmund v Liverpool|the 1–1 draw]]. Three days later, he scored two goals in a 4–1 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] after coming on as a substitute to replace [[Sheyi Ojo]] at half-time.

====2016–17 season====
Origi was used predominantly as a substitute and cup player at the start of [[2016–17 Liverpool F.C. season|the 2016–17 campaign]]. He scored his first goal of the season on 23 August 2016 in a 5–0 [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3755142/Burton-0-5-Liverpool-Divock-Origi-Daniel-Sturridge-Roberto-Firmino-score-EFL-Cup.html|title=Burton 0–5 Liverpool: Divock Origi, Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge find the back of the net as Reds ease into EFL Cup third round|website=Daily Mail|last=King|first=Dominic|date=23 August 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first [[2016–17 Premier League]] goal on 26 November, coming off the bench for the injured [[Philippe Coutinho]] to score the opener in a 2–0 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/26/premier-league-clockwatch-liverpool-vs-sunderland-rest-3pm-kick/|title=Liverpool 2 Sunderland 0: Divock Origi provides relief after Philippe Coutinho is stretchered off|website=Telegraph|last=Findon|first=Ben|date=26 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season: Loan to VfL Wolfsburg====
On 31 August 2017, [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] announced the signing of Origi on a season-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vfl-wolfsburg.de/en/info/news/detailspage/artikel/welkom-divock-origi-47146.html|title=Welkom, Divock Origi! |website=vfl-wolfsburg.de|date=31 August 2017|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpools-divock-origi-joins-wolfsburg-in-6m-season-long/13zpa1prlvhfw1k7zy6spcfxkw|title=Liverpool's Divock Origi joins Wolfsburg in £6m season-long loan deal {{!}} Goal.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season: Return to Liverpool====
On 2 December, Origi scored his first goal of the season in [[Merseyside derby|a derby match]] against city rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], which Liverpool won 1&amp;ndash;0. Origi came on as a substitute for [[Roberto Firmino]] in the 84th minute and scored with a header in the 96th minute, capitalising on an error from Everton goalkeeper [[Jordan Pickford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/328060-match-report-liverpool-everton|title=Origi saves the day{{!}}|date=2 December 2018|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Origi has represented Belgium at [[Belgium national youth football team|under-15]], [[Belgium national youth football team|under-16]], [[Belgium national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Belgium national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He scored ten goals while in the under-19 team, the first in a [[2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification]] match against [[Belarus national under-19 football team|Belarus]] on 12 October 2012.

The [[Football Kenya Federation]] expressed an interest in persuading Origi to play for the [[Kenya national football team|Kenya senior national team]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2013/02/04/3726151/kenya-fa-reveal-they-will-lure-striker-divock-origi-to-play?ICID=HP_MR_2 |title=Kenya FA reveal they will lure striker Divock Origi to play for Harambee Stars |date=4 February 2013 |first=David |last=Kwalimwa |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208060847/http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2013/02/04/3726151/kenya-fa-reveal-they-will-lure-striker-divock-origi-to-play?ICID=HP_MR_2 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 13 May 2014, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium senior national team]] manager [[Marc Wilmots]] announced Origi would be part of the 23-man squad representing Belgium at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27395150 |title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |archivedate=1 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141133/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27395150 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origi came on as a substitute for [[Romelu Lukaku]] in the 58th minute of the opening [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] game against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Belo Horizonte]] on 17 June. In Belgium's second match, again after coming on as a substitute for Lukaku, he scored his first senior international goal in the 88th minute of a 1–0 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] to qualify the ''Red Devils'' for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242 |title=Belgium v Russia |first=Graham |last=Chase |date=22 June 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |archivedate=8 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708204715/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, at 19 years, 2 months and 4 days, he became the youngest goalscorer of the tournament (until [[United States national men's soccer team|American]] winger [[Julian Green]] scored against Belgium during their [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Belgium vs United States|round of 16 match]]), the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history, and the first player of Kenyan origin to score at a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2105895-divock-origis-late-goal-for-belgium-defeats-russia |title=Divock Origi's Late Goal for Belgium Defeats Russia |publisher=Bleacher Report |first=Sean |last=Swaby |date=22 June 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2014 |archivedate=10 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710225439/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2105895-divock-origis-late-goal-for-belgium-defeats-Russia |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances, he was named the Young Talent of the 2014 [[Belgian Sportsman of the year]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2014/12/16/7122662/origi-scoops-belgiums-award-for-most-promising-youngster|title=Lille loanee Divock Origi has won Belgium’s award for most Promising Youngster of the Year 2014 as Liverpool summer signing continues to impress|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joel Matip 2010.jpg|left|thumb|311x311px|Matip with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] during a pre-season training session, in July 2010.|alt=]]
Matip made his professional debut on 17 October 2009 in a [[Regionalliga]] against [[1. FC Saarbrücken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reviersport.de/articles-97252.html | title = Sonntagsschuss bricht das Genick | language = German | publisher = reviersport.de | date = 17 October 2009 | accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Bundesliga]] debut for Schalke on 7 November 2009 against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], in which he scored the game-tying goal and was subsequently named [[man of the match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportbild.bild.de/SPORT/bundesliga/2009/11/07/bayern-schalke/felix-magath-bubi-matip-trifft-louis-van-gaal-wieder-ohne-sieg.html | title = Wieder kein Sieg!

On 2 March 2010, Matip signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ontheminute.com/news/news.php?news=21504 | title = Schalke starlet signs new deal | publisher = ontheminute.com | date = 2 March 2010 | accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Schalke announced that Matip signed a two-year contract extension running until 30 June 2016.

On 23 February 2013, Matip scored both goals as Schalke recorded an important 2–1 victory over [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]], securing the club's second win in 12 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/346200/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |title= Schalke 04 2–1 Fortuna Düsseldorf |publisher=ESPNFC |date=23 February 2013 | accessdate = 9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 15 February 2016, Matip announced signing a four-year pre-contract agreement to join [[Liverpool Football Club|Liverpool]] on a free transfer, following the expiration of his contract with Schalke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/15/joel-matip-liverpool-schalke-transfer-signing | title = Schalke confirm Joel Matip to join Liverpool F.C. in summer | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 16 February 2016 | accessdate = 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2016, Matip officially became a Liverpool player, taking the shirt number 32, whilst [[Cameron Brannagan]], who previously wore 32 took number 25.

==== 2016–17 season ====
Matip made his debut for Liverpool on 23 August 2016 against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] in the [[2016–17 EFL Cup|League Cup]] in a 5–0 win for the Reds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/232883-liverpool-hit-five-to-see-off-burton-in-efl-cup | title = Liverpool hit five to see off Burton in EFL Cup | publisher = LiverpoolFC.com | date = 23 August 2016 | accessdate = 23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 Premier League win over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]] on 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matip|first1=Joël|title=crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-live-match-day-blog|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/match/2016-17/first-team/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-live-match-day-blog|website=www.liverpoolfc.com|publisher=LiverpoolFC.com|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matip was voted as Standard Chartered Player of the Month for his performances in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/246123-joel-matip-scoops-player-of-the-month-award|title=Joel Matip scoops Player of the Month award|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matip was withdrawn from the fixture against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 15 January 2017, as Liverpool were yet to get full clarity from [[FIFA]] over his eligibility, and also as a result of the [[Cameroonian Football Federation|Cameroon Football Federation]] failing to confirm that Matip can therefore play club football during the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/250478-liverpool-fc-statement-on-joel-matip|title=Liverpool FC statement on Joel Matip|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/liverpool-joel-matip-cameroon-fifa-011717|title=Why can't Joel Matip play for Liverpool?

On 1 October 2017, Matip was criticized for his poor performance against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], being deemed at fault for Newcastle's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/861050/Newcastle-Liverpool-Joel-Matip-Joselu-goal|title=Newcastle vs Liverpool: Jamie Carragher blames Joel Matip for Joselu goal|last=Winter|first=Lewis|date=2017-10-01|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November, Matip scored his first goal of the [[2017–18 Liverpool F.C. season|2017–18 season]], scoring in a 4–1 win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the [[London Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/22451|title=West Ham v Liverpool, 2017/18 {{!}} Premier League|website=www.premierleague.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January 2018, Matip scored an [[own goal]] in a 2–3 home defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the [[2017–18 FA Cup#Fourth Round Proper|fourth round of the FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42756218|title=Liverpool 2-3 West Bromwich Albion|date=2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March, during the match against Crystal Palace, Matip suffered a thigh injury. On 3 April, Liverpool announced that he would have to undergo surgery to fix it, and that he will miss the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/296284-joel-matip-injury-news|title=Liverpool confirm Joel Matip injury|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2018–19 season ====
Matip suffered another muscle injury in July 2018 during a tour of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/tour-2018/308451-joel-matip-injury-update|title=Jürgen Klopp offers Joel Matip injury update|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/tour-2018/308584-joel-matip-injury-update|title=Joel Matip injury update|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recovered to be named an unused substitute in a 2–0 away win over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 20 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45165666|title=Crystal Palace 0-2 Liverpool: James Milner and Sadio Mane score as Reds move to six points|date=2018-08-20|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matip was called up on 23 December 2009 by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] for the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] but he later declined to take part in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fecafootonline.com/?lng=1&amp;module=media&amp;idrub=96826&amp;idnews=82399 | title = CAN 2010 : La liste des 23 | publisher = fecafootonline.com | date = 22 December 2009 | accessdate = 5 August 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120302151804/http://www.fecafootonline.com/?lng=1&amp;module=media&amp;idrub=96826&amp;idnews=82399 | archivedate = 2 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reviersport.de/103801---schalke-matip-fuer-afrika-cup-nominiert.html | title = Matip für Afrika-Cup nominiert | language = German | publisher = reviersport.de | date = 23 December 2009 | accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not yet clear if Matip would represent Cameroon in the future as the [[German Football Association]] still hoped that he might represent his country of birth instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11881_5818893,00.html | title = Matip wanted by Germany | publisher = Sky Sports | date = 1 January 2010 | accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2010, aged 18, Matip opted to play his international football for Cameroon, after meeting up with the national team ahead of a friendly against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 3 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8546027.stm | title =  Joel Matip signs for Schalke and decides on Cameroon | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2 March 2010 | accessdate = 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance in the match against Italy and went on to play in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] for Cameroon.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Before becoming a professional musician, Jones studied chemical engineering at the University of Illinois. In 1991, he left a Master's program at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC-Berkeley]] to move back to Chicago, releasing his first song ("Coffee Pot" on ClubHouse Records) the same year.&lt;ref name="rough"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bidder | first = Sean | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = House: the Rough Guide | publisher = Rough Guides Ltd | date = June 1999 | location = London | pages = 44–46 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until this point, music had been a hobby fueled by cobbling together tracks on his "sixty-buck keyboard, a cheap four-track and a cheap drum machine"{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} set-up while still an undergraduate at the University of Illinois. This DIY method of production was never taken seriously, and when childhood plans to become a doctor were shelved, Jones was firmly committed to a career as a chemical engineer. His father was an occasional DJ and eventually became a budding musician. As time went on, Jones discovered what was his innate love and understanding for house music, a sound that had grown throughout the mid-1980s out of Chicago's deep-rooted house music scene. He played the saxophone at school and had a talent for trying to play with a keyboard but remained largely un-interested in what he saw as his father's passion. It was this cut-up and tacky production style of the early house sound that Jones absorbed and translated{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} into the ''Underground Goodies'' EP, his first release as Cajmere (the CAJ derived from the artist's initials) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deejaybooking.com/greenvelvet DJ Booking biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220230353/http://www.deejaybooking.com/greenvelvet |date=2007-02-20 }} Accessed 2008-03-18&lt;/ref&gt;) put out in 1991 on his own recently started Cajual label.&lt;ref name="rough" /&gt; A year later he had his first massive hit as Cajmere with the house tune "Coffee Pot (It's Time for the Percolator)," which was also released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records. He then teamed up with Chicago-based vocalist [[Dajae]] for "Brighter Days," which entered #2 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]],&lt;ref name="rough" /&gt; a high-impact and mellower house tune that was released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records.

===Green Velvet transformation===
Interested in making something totally different from his Cajmere moniker and other work, Curtis created Relief as an offshoot to his Cajual records in 1993. The first Relief release was also his first Green Velvet production, 1993's "Velvet Tracks,"&lt;ref name="rough" /&gt; which came from a name given to him by a girlfriend's father, emerged as the flamboyant, neon-haired electro punk, although in interviews he denied being linked to the Punk lifestyle and fashion, as he was more inspired by the likes of [[David Bowie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Green Velvet|url=https://www.trackitdown.net/news/show/100867.html|website=Trackitdown.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sly and the Family Stone]],&lt;ref name=trustthedj&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101125/http://www.trustthedj.com/SKRUFFF/news_article.php?news_id=5931] An interview with Curtis, web archive from 2009&lt;/ref&gt; he created mid-1990s hits such as "Preacher Man," on which a [[Moral Majority]]-type of preacher spoke (the Reverend Trotter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=An Interview With Cajmere|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/10599-cajmere-green-velvet-interview|website=The Quietus |author=Melissa Bradshaw |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2015|quote=Green Velvet's 'The Preacher Man', a pumping acid-y techno track which featured Chicago's Reverend Trotter sermonising about young people these days sleeping around, was conceived when Jones got home after a night out and heard Trotter on the radio.}}&lt;/ref&gt; not, contrary to popular belief, Reverend Franklin); "Answering Machine," a darkly funny house track consisting of taped messages from an answering machine, including a bad news message from a girlfriend and a noise complaint message from his landlord—all made with Jones's voice; and "Flash," which was a #1 US dance hit in 1995 and was included on many [[disc jockey|DJ]]-mixed compilation albums. After DJing under both of his now infamous monikers, he released his first album, ''[[Constant Chaos]]'', with Belgian Music label Music Man in 1999,&lt;ref name="rough" /&gt; which showed Green Velvet's style of house progress into styles similar to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Kraftwerk]], his spoken-word monologues also took a bizarre turn. In ''Abduction'' he spoke about little green men turning up while washing dishes.

===The ''Whatever'' era===
By the time ''Constant Chaos'' was released, Jones had temporarily halted activity on his labels for almost a year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work out what to do next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]]' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled ''[[Green Velvet (album)|Green Velvet]]'', which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark ''[[Whatever (Green Velvet album)|Whatever]]'', which was a step away from his [[Kraftwerk]]-inspired sound (although ''Sleepwalking'' had a similar style) to a darker, more political [[Punk rock|Punk]]-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song ''When?''), drug use (highlighted on ''Genedefekt'' and ''La La Land''), alienation (highlighted on ''Sleepwalking''), and being told what to wear and do by “the system” (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track ''Gat''). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to [[industrial music|industrial]] bands such as [[Nitzer Ebb]] and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of "underground American industrial stuff." He released the single ''La La Land'' in 2001, originally designed as a wake-up call for clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by ''Genedefekt''. His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a [[keytar]], and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]] live session on the [[Jo Whiley]] show and playing a host of festivals.

===Recent projects===
After appearing under a host of different names for his various remixing and side projects, Green Velvet released his third album, ''[[Walk In Love]]'', in 2005. This album had a more [[house music]]-oriented style to it, but the odd Prince- and Punk-sounding tracks still remained, as Curtis actually got a live guitarist to play on "Come Back" and the closing track "Pin-Up Girl" had a similarity to New York-based Electroclash group [[Fischerspooner]]. After ''Walk In Love'', Green Velvet produced and remixed releases for fellow Relief Records artists and himself, and played a host of DJ session live shows in 2006.

After staying quiet in the music scene, Green Velvet revealed in 2006 he had become a [[born-again Christian]] after a serious overdose of a mixture of [[Magic Mushrooms]], [[Marijuana]] and (allegedly) [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]],&lt;ref name=trustthedj/&gt; and promised to turn his life around after this incident. His latest release, the single "Shake and Pop", is a departure from the recent darker electronica style, as he claims he has found a brighter future since converting. In 2007, he released the online-only track "Love Peace, Not War", a short ditty in response to the United States' war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Velvet: All about the love|url=http://inthemix.junkee.com/green-velvet-all-about-the-love/13315 |author=Jack Tregoning |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Green Velvet joined forces with [[Claude VonStroke]], another veteran artist who grew up in the Mid-West, to form a side project known as Get Real. With both having a noticeable impact on both the house and techno scenes, many wondered why this duo didn't happen sooner. In reality, the project was by accident. However, it couldn't have turned out better. Their first release came out as an EP on Claude's label, Dirtybird, with the appearance of “Mind Yo Bizness” and “Snuffaluffagus". Claude has stated, “Nobody is trying to steal the spotlight or take over the project which isn’t always the case in a duo. We each represent our style but we make a new style by working together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude VonStroke &amp; Green Velvet are taking Get Real to the next level|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2015/01/claude-vonstroke-green-velvet-real-deal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====
Having impressed first-team [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Jürgen Klopp]] during these training sessions, Woodburn was handed his non-competitive debut during the [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]] pre-season in a 1–0 win over [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/2016/07/tranmere-rovers-0-1-liverpool-5-things-learned-pre-season-opener/|title=Tranmere Rovers 0–1 Liverpool: 5 things we learned from the pre-season opener|publisher=This is Anfield|first=Ben|last=Twelves|date=8 July 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench in Liverpool's next match to score one and assist another for [[Roberto Firmino]] in a 5–0 [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] win over [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/categories/english-premier-league/club-friendly-fleetwood-town-0-4-liverpool-13-july-2016/233675|title=Ruthless Reds Crush Fleetwood|work=Soccer Laduma|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodburn then, along with [[Kevin Stewart (footballer)|Kevin Stewart]] and fellow academy graduate [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], signed his first professional contract with Liverpool on 8 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/242420-trio-commit-long-term-futures-to-lfc-by-signing-new-deals|title=Trio commit long-term futures to LFC by signing new deals|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|first=James|last=Carroll|date=8 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2012, the move was made permanent with Karius committing himself to a two-year deal with an option for a third year that would extend his contract to June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/563095/artikel_bis-2014_05-bindet-karius.html|title=Bis 2014: 05 bindet Karius|author=Staff writer(s)|publisher=''[[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]]''|language=German|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his Mainz 05 debut on 1 December 2012 in a [[Bundesliga]] match against [[Hannover 96]] when he was substituted for [[Shawn Parker]] after goalkeeper [[Christian Wetklo]] had been sent off, which, aged 19 years, 5 months and 9 days old, made Karius the youngest goalkeeper ever to play in the Bundesliga.&lt;ref name=goalinterview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/mainz-05-vs-hannover-96/1300903/lineups|title=Mainz 05 vs Hannover 96 Match Report|author=Staff writer(s)|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=1 December 2012|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no further appearances in the 2012–13 season, but established himself as first-choice goalkeeper in the 2013–14 season and on 12 January 2015 signed a three-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/loris-karius-verlaengert-bei-mainz-05.jsp|title=Loris Karius verlängert beim 1.

Karius was ever-present in the [[2015–16 1.

==== 2017–18 season ====
In the 2018 Champions League quarter-final 2nd leg at [[Manchester City]], with the aggregate scoreline at 3–1 to Liverpool Karius was involved in a controversial incident when he failed to clear a cross into the penalty area, punching the ball downward which ricocheted off teammate James Milner and into the path of Man City striker [[Gabriel Jesus]] who scored, only for the linesman to incorrectly give offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City 1–2 (agg. 1–5) Liverpool: Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino stun Blues to advance to Champions League semi-finals – 5 talking points |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-city-1-2-agg-12338906 |access-date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror]] |last=Rathborn |first=Jack |date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Champions League semi-final home leg against [[AS Roma]], with the scoreline at 0–0 Karius let [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]’s shot go through his hands with the ball then hitting the crossbar, before Liverpool went on to win 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool 5–2 Roma: Win unlike any football I've seen before – Lawrenson |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43888382 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=25 April 2018 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=13 July 2018 |last=Lawrenson |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the away game in Rome, Karius was involved in controversy when he came rushing out of his goal and brought down [[Edin Dzeko]] inside the penalty area, but instead of a penalty and red card the linesman gave offside in what ''The Telegraph'' called “an extremely tight call”.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Minutes later Karius parried a Roma shot into the path of Dzeko who made the scoreline 2–1 to Roma, before the game finished 4–2 to Roma and 7–6 to Liverpool on aggregate.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool ride their luck in Rome but survive to reach eighth European Cup final |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/05/02/roma-vs-liverpool-champions-league-live-score-updates/ |access-date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Burt |first=Jason |date=3 May 2018 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karius started for Liverpool against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final]] which Liverpool lost 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44258022|title=Real Madrid 3–1 Liverpool|date=2018-05-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deemed at fault for two of the goals, the first and third; the first after his throw was blocked by [[Karim Benzema]] and deflected into the net, and the second after he mishandled [[Gareth Bale]]'s 40-yard strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-stand-loris-karius-despite-14711508 |title=Liverpool will stand by Loris Karius despite Champions League horror show |publisher=Liverpool Echo |author=Ian Doyle |date=27 May 2018 |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match, he wept and tearfully apologised to Liverpool fans who remained in the stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/26/loris-karius-gives-tearful-apology-liverpool-fans-mistakes-real-madrid-7580859/ |title=Loris Karius gives tearful apology to Liverpool fans after mistakes against Real Madrid |publisher=Metro |author=Chris Dawie |date=26 May 2018 |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that his mistakes "lost the team the final".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Loris Karius apologises to Liverpool for Champions League horror show: 'my mistakes lost us the final' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/loris-karius-liverpool-champions-league-mistakes-real-madrid-final-mohamed-salah-sergio-ramos-a8371136.html |work=The Independent |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Karius received online [[death threats]], mainly on [[Twitter]], which prompted [[Merseyside Police]] to launch an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius sent death threats by fans after howlers during Champions League final |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/liverpool-goalkeeper-loris-karius-sent-death-threats-by-fans-after-howlers-during-champions-league-a3849211.html |publisher=Standard.co.uk |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Loris Karius: Liverpool goalkeeper receives death threats after howlers|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/loris-karius-liverpool-death-threats/|publisher=The South African |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Karius underwent an examination at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Medics concluded he had suffered a concussion from an elbow to his head, reportedly from [[Sergio Ramos]] just minutes before his first mistake. Doctors, however, did not pinpoint the exact moment he was concussed.

Karius’s handling was back in the spotlight in July 2018 during pre season with Liverpool.&lt;ref name="Errors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt; In the warm-up to Liverpool’s pre-season opener against [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], footage showed Karius spilling the ball into his own net.&lt;ref name="Errors"/&gt; Against [[Tranmere Rovers]] on 10 July, he fumbled a free-kick which directly led to a goal.&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;{{cite news |title=Klopp rallies behind Karius after pre-season blunder |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/0710/977810-klopp-rallies-behind-karius-after-pre-season-blunder/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |agency=RTE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days later Liverpool broke the world transfer fee record for a goalkeeper when they signed [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]] for an initial fee of €62.5 million (£56m), which could rise to €72 million (£66.8 million) with performance-based bonuses, and relegated Karius to a back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-confirm-signing-alisson-becker-14930903 |title=Liverpool confirm signing of Alisson Becker in world record deal |author=Pearce, James |publisher=Liverpool Echo |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720022616/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-confirm-signing-alisson-becker-14930903 |archive-date=20 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Against [[Borussia Dortmund]] on 22 July, Karius came rushing out of his box but his scuffed clearance fell straight into the path of [[Maximilian Philipp]] who was unable to put the ball into the empty net from 40 yards. He was deemed at fault for Dortmund’s third goal late on when he parried [[Christian Pulisic]]’s shot from close range directly into the path of [[Jacob Bruun Larsen]], who scored.&lt;ref name="Errors"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool fans worry for Loris Karius as he makes a mistake after four minutes against Borussia Dortmund |url= https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/22/liverpool-fans-worry-loris-karius-makes-mistake-four-minutes-borussia-dortmund-7746854/?ito=cbshare |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loan to Beşiktaş ====
On 25 August 2018, Karius joined Turkish club [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] on a two-year loan move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45311332|title=Loris Karius: Liverpool goalkeeper joins Turkey's Besiktas on loan|date=2018-08-25|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool FC"/&gt;

'''Marko Grujić''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Марко Грујић}}, {{IPA-sh|mâːrko ɡrûːjitɕ|pron}}; born 13 April 1996) is a Serbian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Hertha BSC]] on loan from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]].

A native of [[Belgrade]], Grujić started his career with his hometown club [[Red Star Belgrade]], progressing through their [[youth system]] to the [[first team]] squad. He made his professional debut in 2013, and won the [[Serbian SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] title in his final season with Red Star before completing a £5.1 million move to Liverpool.

Grujić is a Serbian international, and represented Serbia at every youth level from under-16 upwards before making his full international debut in May 2016. He was part of the [[Serbia national under-20 football team|Serbian side]] which won the [[2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2015 U-20 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Red Star Belgrade===
Grujić was born in [[Belgrade]], [[FR Yugoslavia]] (now [[Serbia]]) and is a product of [[Red Star Belgrade]], where he went through the youth program, passed all categories and was the captain of his generation. He made his professional debut for Red Star on 26 May 2013, in a [[Serbian SuperLiga]] match versus [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crvenazvezdafk.com/vesti/izvestaji/7369/Vojvodina+-+Crvena+zvezda+3%3A0+(1%3A0).html|script-title=sr:Војводина – Црвена звезда 3:0 (1:0)|website=Red Star Belgrade official website|language=Serbian|date=26 May 2013|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2015, Grujić signed a three-year contract with Red Star to last until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/sport/fudbal/grujic-i-jovic-do-2018.-u-zvezdi_600503.html Grujić and Jovic by 2018 in Zvezda] Radio Televizija Vojvodine: ''Grujić i Jović do 2018. u Zvezdi'' {{sr icon}} 17 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Grujić scored his first senior goal on 26 September 2015 against [[FK Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]] in a 2–0 victory; he also assisted [[Aleksandar Katai]] for the second goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.onefootball.com/en/match/fk-red-star-belgrade-vs-fk-novi-pazar-overview-123-444846?period=FullTime&amp;variable=g2|title=Red Star vs Novi Pazar report|publisher=onefootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grujić was a part of an unprecedented run of Red Star victories, as the club set a new record for the number of consecutive victories (19), ending the first half of the season without defeat.&lt;ref name="Count"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2758612/miodrag-bozovic-is-breaking-records-at-red-star-belgrade|author=Michael Yokhin|title=ESPN: ''Miodrag 'The Count' Bozovic breaking records at Red Star Belgrade''|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
Throughout autumn, Grujić was scouted by a number of high-profile European teams, including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Internazionale]], [[Juventus]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. [[List of Liverpool F.C. managers|Liverpool manager]] [[Jürgen Klopp]] called Grujić personally to convince him to switch to [[Anfield]], but initially Grujić's father was against his son moving to Liverpool.&lt;ref name="Novosti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurir.rs/sport/fudbal/terzicu-ne-diraj-mi-sina-clanak-2069371|title=OTAC MARKA GRUJIĆA EKSKLUZIVNO ZA KURIR: Terziću, ne diraj mi sina|author=Aleksandar Radonić|language=Serbian|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klopp's assistant, [[Željko Buvač]], flew to Belgrade to speak with Grujić and on 6 January 2016, it was confirmed that Grujić completed his move to [[Premier League]] side [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], signing a five-year deal for a reported fee of £5.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Tom|title=Marko Grujic confirmed as Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's first signing|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2780433/marko-grujic-confirmed-as-liverpool-player|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|accessdate=12 January 2016|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marko Grujic: Liverpool sign Red Star Belgrade midfielder|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35244115|accessdate=6 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining, Grujić hailed Klopp for convincing him to join and told the press, "I would choose Liverpool over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marko Grujic reveals his Liverpool role, hints at Lazar Markovic's future – This Is Anfield|url = http://www.thisisanfield.com/2016/02/marko-grujic-reveals-his-liverpool-role-hints-at-markovic-future/|website = This Is Anfield|access-date = 24 February 2016|language = en-GB|first = Jack|last = Lusby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was immediately loaned back to Red Star until the end of the season for a fee of £740,000, and won the [[Serbian SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] with Red Star while on loan. Grujić finished the season with 29 appearances, 6 goals, 7 assists and was voted into the SuperLiga Team of the Year for his contribution to Red Star's unbeaten season.

On 20 August 2016, Grujić made his [[Premier League]] debut for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a 2–0 loss against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], coming on in the place of [[Adam Lallana]] in the 78th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37067882|title=Burnley 2–0 Liverpool|last=Bevan|first=Chris|date=20 August 2016|website=BBC.com|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Cardiff City====
On 17 January 2018, Grujić joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the remainder of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-fc-star-marko-grujic-14167521 |title=Liverpool FC star Marko Grujic signs for Cardiff City and describes it as 'breakthrough moment' of his career |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Tom Coleman |date=17 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club three days later, playing in a 0–0 draw with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42671933 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 0–0 Cardiff City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2018 |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grujić's first goal for Cardiff came in a 2–1 home victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 6 March 2018, scoring from range just after the start of the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43206633 |title=Cardiff City 2–1 Barnsley |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Dafydd Pritchard |date=6 March 2018 |accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marko Grujic|url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/13985/Marko-Grujic/overview|publisher=Premier League|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Hertha BSC====
On 19 August 2018, Grujić joined [[Bundesliga]] club [[Hertha BSC]] on a one-year loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Marko Grujic kommt aus Liverpool|trans-title=Marko Grujić joins from Liverpool|date=19 August 2018|accessdate=19 August 2018|publisher=[[Hertha BSC]]|url=https://www.herthabsc.de/de/intern/verpflichtung-marko-grujic/page/14925--17-17-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on 8 December, netting the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/hertha-berlin-eintracht-frankfurt-live-line-ups-stats-luka-jovic-rebic-ibisevic-fantasy-518406.jsp|title=Marko Grujic wins Hertha Berlin all three points against Eintracht Frankfurt|publisher=Bundesliga|date=8 December 2018|accessdate=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hertha coach [[Pal Dardai]] hailed Grujić as "by far the best midfielder at Hertha Berlin in 20 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marko Grujic "by far the best midfielder at Hertha Berlin in 20 years" – Pal Dardai

==International career==
Grujić represented Serbia at all youth levels from under-16 to under-21, and was a member of the Serbia squad that won the [[2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="sky1"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/10107776/who-is-marko-grujic-we-profile-the-red-star-belgrade-youngster|title=Who is Marko Grujic? We profile Liverpool signing|publisher=skysports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Grujić made his full international debut for the [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]] after coming on in place of [[Nemanja Matić]] in a 2–1 win against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fss.rs/index.php?id=2021&amp;aid=10348|title=Фудбалски савез Србије – званична веб презентација|website=www.fss.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Serbia's preliminary squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fss.rs/index.php?id=2021&amp;aid=13898 |title=Један тим, срцем свим – Младен Крстајић одабрао |trans-title=One team, with all their hearts – Mladen Krstajić selects |website=FSS.rs |publisher=[[Football Association of Serbia]] |date=24 May 2018 |access-date=24 May 2018 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 he was selected in Serbia's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44083365 | title = World Cup 2018: All the confirmed squads for this summer's finals in Russia | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 4 June 2018 | accessdate = 25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he failed to make any appearances there.

==Style of play==
Standing at 6-foot-3-inches (1.91 m), Grujić has been described as "tall, rangy, comfortable on the ball and with a good range of passing" and dubbed the "new Matić" because of his likeness in both appearance and position to fellow Serbian defensive midfielder [[Nemanja Matić]].&lt;ref name="sky1"/&gt;

'''Daniel William John Ings''' (born 23 July 1992) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from fellow {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Ings started his career in the youth team of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined [[AFC Bournemouth]], progressing through their youth system, while also spending time at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] on loan. In 2011 Ings joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] with whom he won the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 Championship]] Player of the Year, and helped them achieve promotion to the Premier League. Following Burnley's relegation, and the expiry of his contract with the club, Ings moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2015, but his first season at [[Anfield]] was ended after two months due to injury. His second season with Liverpool was also mired by injury, with Ings only making two League Cup appearances throughout the 2016–17 season. Ings joined Southampton on loan in August 2018, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.

Formerly an [[England national under-21 football team|under-21 international]], Ings made his senior debut for England in October 2015.

On 15 October 2015, in his first training session under new manager [[Jürgen Klopp]], Ings suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]] in his left knee and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Ings: Liverpool striker out for season with knee injury |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34542231 |accessdate=15 October 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ings returned sooner than anticipated, making a substitute appearance in the final match of the season, a 1–1 draw away to West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sport |first1=Mike Henson BBC |title=West Bromwich Albion 1–1 Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240499 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ings began the 2016–17 season playing in the reserves to help regain fitness.

'''Ádám Bogdán''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈaːdaːm ˈboɡdaːn}}; born 27 September 1987) is a Hungarian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], on loan from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]].

Bogdán began his career in Hungary at [[Vasas SC|Vasas]] before spending time on loan at [[Vecsési FC|Vecsés]]. In 2007, he moved to English club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], for whom he made 120 appearances across all competitions, before moving to Liverpool in 2015. Rarely used at Liverpool, he had a loan at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2016, cut short by injury.
 
He made his senior international debut in 2011. Bogdán has since earned 20 caps and represented Hungary in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Budapest]], Bogdán started his career with Hungarian [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I]] (Division One) team [[Vasas SC]]. He also had a loan spell at [[Vecsési FC|Vecsés]] where in his 9 games he impressed Bolton scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ÁDÁM BOGDÁN profile|url=http://www.hungarianfootball.com/player-profiles/adam-bogdan/|website=hungarianfootball.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolton Wanderers===
He signed for [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on a two-year contract on 1 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mark|last=Buckingham|title=Bolton bag Hungary keeper|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12875_2636279,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract was extended in 2009 until June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bogdan Thrilled To Extend His Deal|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1511375,00.html|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194006/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1511375,00.html|archivedate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Bogdán joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] team [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on a one-month [[loan (association football)|loan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Crewe sign Bolton keeper Bogdan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crewe_alexandra/8278719.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 29 September 2009 in a 3–2 home defeat to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], during which he made an error that cost Alexandra a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Crewe 2–3 Bury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8271066.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his Bolton debut in a 1–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 24 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Southampton 0–1 Bolton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8936599.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August 2010, Bogdán made his [[Premier League]] debut when he replaced [[Jussi Jääskeläinen]], who had been sent off for violent conduct, 37 minutes into the home game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Whyatt|first=Chris|title=Bolton 2–2 Birmingham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8946659.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start in the away game at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 11 September. Following Jääskeläinen's return, Bogdán returned to the bench but manager [[Owen Coyle]] gave Bogdán starts in both the League Cup and [[FA Cup]]. On 31 March 2011, he signed an extension to his existing contract, which would keep him at the club until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bolton tie down young goalkeeper Bogdán to new three-year deal at the Reebok|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1371872/Adam-Bogdan-signs-new-Bolton-contract-2014.html?|work=Daily Mail|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/9441933.stm|title=Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan signs contract until 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011–12 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2011–12 season]] gave Bogdán more playing time after Jääskeläinen suffered an injury during an international break,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/adam-bogdans-slow-rise-to-top-at-bolton-worth-the-wait|title=Adam Bogdan's slow rise to top at Bolton worth the wait|work=The National|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his first league game, on 2 October, he conceded five goals against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Jääskeläinen returned for the next league game. Three months later on 4 January, after Jääskeläinen suffered another injury, Bogdán returned for a game at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] where he was beaten by a 102-yard wind assisted clearance by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] from his own penalty area in a 2–1 victory at [[Goodison Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Everton 1 – 2 Bolton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16343401.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2012, Bogdán saved a [[penalty kick]] from [[Wayne Rooney]], although Bolton lost 3–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/bolton_wanderers/s/1470802_adam-bogdan-out-to-be-boltons-no1|title=Adam Bogdan out to be Bolton's No.1 |work=Manchester Evening News|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed well during Jääskeläinen's absence and when the Finn returned from injury, Bogdán kept his place for the home game against Arsenal on 1 February, in which he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. Despite Jääskeläinen's return to full fitness, Bogdán remained first choice goalkeeper. On 11 March 2012, after Bolton's victory over [[QPR]], and on 1 April 2012, after Bolton's 3–2 victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Bogdán was selected for in the "team of the week" by [[Garth Crooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17334957|title=Garth Crooks's team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17580431|title=Garth Crooks's team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 April 2012|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2012, Bolton Wanderers held their annual end of season dinner, with Bogdán the recipient of the main accolade as he was named the club's Player of the Year, which is voted by the supporters.&lt;ref name="Bogdan Named Player Of The Year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2771857,00.html|title=Bogdan Named Player of the Year|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516081607/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2771857,00.html|archivedate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán admitted he felt mixed emotions after getting the award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2772157,00.html|title=Mixed Emotions For Bogdan|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516081618/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2772157,00.html|archivedate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the draw against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in Bolton's relegation from the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973085|title=Bolton's 11-year stay in the Premier League has come to an end after being held to a draw at Stoke|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdán signed a contract extension on 29 November 2012, which extended his contract to summer 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/contract-extension-for-bogdan-29.11.12-516528.aspx|title=Contract Extension For Bogdan|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014–15 season, Bogdán only made 10 appearances for Bolton, after being displaced as the team's first-choice goalkeeper by [[Andy Lonergan]].

===Liverpool===
On 12 June 2015, it was confirmed that Bogdán would join [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on a free transfer on 1 July, when his contract expired.&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33107895|title=Adam Bogdan: Liverpool sign Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2015|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 September, in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] third round tie against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] at [[Anfield]], and saved three penalties in the shootout, enabling his side to win the shootout 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool 1–1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34265500|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 December, he made his Premier League debut for the Reds in a 3–0 loss to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Vicarage Road]], dropping a corner kick after three minutes to allow [[Nathan Aké]] to open the scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=Matt|title=Watford 3–0 Liverpool: Nathan Ake capitalises on Adam Bogdan howler and Odion Ighalo strikes to condemn Jurgen Klopp's men to defeat as Hornets move a point off the Premier League top four|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3367794/Watford-3-0-Liverpool-Nathan-Ake-capitalises-Adam-Bogdan-howler-Odion-Ighalo-strikes-condemn-Jurgen-Klopp-s-men-defeat-Hornets-point-Premier-League-four.html|accessdate=21 December 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán also played in a much-changed Liverpool side away to [[Exeter City]] on 8 January 2016 in the third round of the FA Cup, conceding direct from [[Lee Holmes]]' corner kick in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35155398|title=Exeter City 2 – 2 Liverpool|date=8 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last match of the 2015–16 Premier League season, Bogdán was named in the starting line up against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] after a long absence from the first team squad. West Brom opened the scoring through [[Salomón Rondón]] in the 13th minute, before [[Jordon Ibe]] leveled in the 23rd minute – the match ended in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/05/15/england/premier-league/west-bromwich-albion-football-club/liverpool-fc/2043606/?ICID=PL_MS_04|title=West Bromwich 1 – 1 Liverpool|date=15 May 2016|work=Soccerway|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240499|title=West Bromwich Albion 1–1 Liverpool|date=15 May 2016|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2016, Bogdán joined Wigan Athletic on loan for the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Adam Bogdan joins Wigan on season-long loan |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/228317-adam-bogdan-joins-wigan-on-season-long-loan |publisher=Liverpool FC |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán made 17 appearances for Wigan, keeping five clean sheets. In his final game, a 0–0 draw against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 19 November, Bogdán suffered a tear in his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and was substituted in the 59th minute. Bogdán then returned to his parent club Liverpool for rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-bogdan-returns-liverpool-after-12210823|title=Bogdan returns to Liverpool after loan deal cut short|last=Pearce|first=James|date=2016-11-22|work=liverpoolecho|accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2018, Bogdán moved on a season-long loan to [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44686135 |title=Adam Bogdan: Liverpool goalkeeper joins Hibs on loan |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2018 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
