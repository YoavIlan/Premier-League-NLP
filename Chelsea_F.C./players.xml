'''Kepa Arrizabalaga Revuelta''' ({{IPA-eu|kepa aris̻aβalaɣa reβuelta|lang}}; {{IPA-es|ˈkepa ariθaβaˈlaɣa reˈβwelta|lang}}; born 3 October 1994) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]]. He is sometimes referred to mononomously by his forename.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefutbol.com/en/convocados/kepa-arrizabalaga|title=Kepa Arrizabalaga|publisher=[[Royal Spanish Football Federation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226000752/http://www.sefutbol.com/en/convocados/kepa-arrizabalaga|archive-date=26 February 2019|dead-url=no|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed at [[Athletic Bilbao]], he played his first professional games on loan at [[SD Ponferradina|Ponferradina]] and [[Real Valladolid]], in [[Segunda División]]. He then returned to his first club, going on to appear in 54 matches across all competitions; in 2018, he signed with Chelsea.

Arrizabalaga won the [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2012 European Championship]] with [[Spain national under-19 football team|Spain's under-19 team]] and made his [[Spain national football team|senior]] debut in 2017, being selected for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Athletic Bilbao===
Born in [[Ondarroa]], [[Biscay]], Basque Country, Arrizabalaga joined [[Athletic Bilbao]]'s youth setup at [[Lezama Facilities|Lezama]] in 2004, aged ten. He made his senior debut with [[CD Basconia|the farm team]] in January 2012, in [[Tercera División]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europapress.es/deportes/futbol-00162/noticia-chelsea-ficha-kepa-portero-mas-caro-historia-20180808231338.html|title=El Chelsea ficha a Kepa, el portero más caro de la historia|trans-title=Chelsea sign Kepa, most expensive goalkeeper in history|publisher=[[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]]|language=es|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=9 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 2012, Arrizabalaga was called up to the main squad for a [[La Liga]] match against [[Getafe CF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=12069&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club-Getafe: Line-ups|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained unused in the 0–0 draw at the [[San Mamés Stadium (1913)|San Mamés Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2011_12/primera/jornada_37/ath_get/|title=Sin argumentos en la Catedral|trans-title=No arguments at the Cathedral|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|first=Álvaro|last=Sánchez|language=es|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also called up to pre-season in July, and on 23 September was also a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in another home game of the same outcome, against [[Málaga CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2012_13/primera/jornada_5/ath_mga/|title=Europa les pesa|trans-title=Europe weighs on them|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|first=Ángel|last=Liceras|language=es|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrizabalaga was promoted to [[Bilbao Athletic|the reserves]] in January 2013, to cover for injured [[Jon Ander Serantes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/33979-en-lezama-apuestan-fuerte-por-kepa-arrizabalaba|title=En Lezama apuestan fuerte por Kepa Arrizabalaga|trans-title=Lezama bets high on Kepa Arrizabalaga|publisher=El Desmarque|language=es|date=9 January 2013|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the B-side on 16 February 2013, keeping a [[Shutout|clean sheet]] in a 1–0 win over [[UD Logroñés]] for the [[Segunda División B]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniondeportivalogroñes.com/index.php/8-destacados/131-bilbao-athletic-1-0-union-deportiva-logrones|title=Bilbao Athletic 1–0 Unión Deportiva Logroñés|publisher=UD Logroñés|language=es|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March, he was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] towards the end of a 3–1 home win over [[SD Amorebieta]], as was teammate [[Jon García Herrero|Jon García]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/34732-el-bilbao-athletic-amenaza-el-liderato-del-alaves|title=El Bilbao Athletic amenaza el liderato del Alavés|trans-title=Bilbao Athletic threaten Alavés' lead|publisher=El Desmarque|language=es|date=4 March 2013|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April he suffered a [[Athletic pubalgia|pubalgia]], only returning to the fields in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/37480-Kepa-Arrizabalaga-reaparece-casi-seis-meses-despu%C3%A9s-en-el-Bilbao-Athletic|title=Kepa Arrizabalaga reaparece casi seis meses después en el Bilbao Athletic|trans-title=Kepa Arrizabalaga reappears after nearly six months in Bilbao Athletic|publisher=El Desmarque|first=Javi|last=Beltrán|language=es|date=29 September 2013|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrizabalaga appeared regularly for the B's after his return, but broke the first [[metacarpal]] of his right hand in January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=13915&amp;idi=2|title=Kepa Arrizabalaga's injury|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being sidelined for a month. On 11 March, Getafe submitted a loan request to the ''Lions'' for him, as a replacement to injured [[Miguel Ángel Moyá]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aupaathletic.com/noticias/noticias-ver.asp?id=11023|title=El Getafe pide la cesión de Kepa Arrizabalaga|trans-title=Getafe ask for Kepa Arrizabalaga's loan|publisher=Aupa Athletic|language=es|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was rejected a day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/2014-03-12/athletic-rechaza-ceder-hasta-20140312.html|title=El Athletic rechaza ceder hasta final de Liga al portero Kepa al Getafe|trans-title=Athletic reject loaning goalkeeper Kepa to Getafe until the end of the League|newspaper=[[El Correo]]|first=Javier|last=Ortiz de Lazcano|language=es|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2015, Arrizabalaga was loaned to [[Segunda División]]'s [[SD Ponferradina]] until June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdponferradina.com/-/mi|title=Kepa Arrizabalaga se incorpora a la Ponferradina|trans-title=Kepa Arrizabalaga added to Ponferradina|publisher=SD Ponferradina|language=es|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109172714/http://www.sdponferradina.com/-/mi|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on the 11th, starting in a 1–1 home draw against [[Racing de Santander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2015/01/11/futbol/2adivision/1421014655.html|title=El Racing encontró justo premio a su trabajo en el último minuto|trans-title=Racing's work paid off in the last minute|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=es|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2015, Arrizabalaga moved to [[Real Valladolid]] also in the second tier, in a [[2015–16 Segunda División|season]]-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realvalladolid.es/noticias/actualidad/20072015/Kepa-cierra-la-porteria-del-Pucela/|title=Kepa cierra la portería del Pucela|trans-title=Kepa shuts down goal of Pucela|publisher=Real Valladolid|language=es|date=20 July 2015|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first competitive game on 22 August, in a 0–1 loss at [[Córdoba CF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2015/08/23/futbol/equipos/cordoba/1440284201.html|title=Fidel resuelve en un gran partido del Córdoba|trans-title=Fidel the decider in a great Córdoba match|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|first=Alberto|last=Laz|language=es|date=23 August 2015|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and missed only three matches as his team finished 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diariodevalladolid.es/noticias/deportes/kepa-traera-dinero-zorrilla_125966.html|title=Kepa traerá dinero a Zorrilla|trans-title=Kepa will bring money to Zorrilla|newspaper=Diario de Valladolid|language=es|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=9 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from loan, Arrizabalaga was definitely included in the first team, initially as third-choice behind [[Gorka Iraizoz]] and [[Iago Herrerín]]. He made his debut in the top flight on 11 September 2016, starting in a 1–0 away win over [[Deportivo de La Coruña]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2016_17/la-liga/jornada_3/dep_ath/|title=Raúl García exhibe su pegada|trans-title=Raúl García shows his power|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|first=Jaime|last=Rincón|language=es|date=11 September 2016|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2018, amid heavy transfer speculation linking him to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], Arrizabalaga renewed his contract – due to expire that June – until 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11848/11218301/kepa-arrizabalaga-ends-real-madrid-speculation-by-signing-athletic-bilbao-deal|title=Kepa Arrizabalaga ends Real Madrid speculation by signing Athletic Bilbao deal|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=22 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:Chelsea 3 Arsenal 2 (43443195334).jpg|thumb|left|Arrizabalaga playing for Chelsea in a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2018]]
On 8 August 2018, Athletic Bilbao announced on their website that Arrizabalaga had paid his required [[release clause]] (€80&amp;nbsp;million / £71.6&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.athletic-club.eus/en/noticias/19263/kepa-pays-termination-clause.html|title=Kepa pays termination clause|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|world's most expensive goalkeeper]] only weeks after the record was set by [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]]'s transfer to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/07/chelsea-kepa-arrizabalaga-athletic-bilbao-record|title=Chelsea to pay £71.6m for Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Dominic|last=Fifield|date=7 August 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, his move to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a seven-year contract was confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2018/8/8/kepa-arrives-at-chelsea|title=Kepa arrives at Chelsea|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Thibaut Courtois]] who departed for [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and he made his [[Premier League]] debut three days later in a 3–0 away win against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45067371|title=Huddersfield Town 0–3 Chelsea|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|first=Michael|last=Emons|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to keep six clean sheets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/chelseas-kepa-relishing-being-worlds-most-expensive-keeper/ph9py6s9dsx616jcv411ad0jq|title=Chelsea's Kepa relishing being world's most expensive keeper|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=10 October 2018|accessdate=9 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the team's 12-match unbeaten run in the league, before a 3–1 defeat at the hands of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/tottenham-vs-chelsea/390883|title=Tottenham 3–1 Chelsea: Maurizio Sarri's unbeaten start ended|publisher=Sky Sports|first=Ron|last=Walker|date=24 November 2018|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 24 January 2019, in the second leg of the [[EFL Cup]] semi-final, Arrizabalaga saved a [[Penalty (association football)|penalty]] from Tottenham's [[Lucas Moura]] in a 4–2 [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|shootout]] win at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], helping his team go through to the [[2019 EFL Cup Final|final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/chelsea-make-spurs-pay-the-penalty/157724|title=Carabao Cup semi-final: Chelsea beat Tottenham 4–2 on penalties to book final clash with Manchester City at Wembley|newspaper=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]|date=24 January 2019|accessdate=24 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2019, during the [[2019 EFL Cup Final]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], with the match at 0–0 near the end of extra time, [[Maurizio Sarri]] called for Arrizabalaga to be substituted off for [[Willy Caballero]] for the upcoming penalty shootout; Sarri was concerned over his leg cramping a few minutes prior after making a diving save. However, Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted, gesticulating and remaining on the field. During the shootout, he saved one penalty as Chelsea lost the shoot-out 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burt |first1=Jason |last2=Tyers |first2=Mike |title=Manchester City take the honours after Kepa Arrizabalaga antics overshadow otherwise drab League Cup final |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/02/24/chelsea-vs-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-2019-live-score/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=25 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WATCH: Kepa Arrizabalaga defies furious Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri in Carabao Cup final |url=https://news.sky.com/story/watch-kepa-arrizabalaga-defies-furious-chelsea-boss-maurizio-sarri-in-carabao-cup-final-11647428 |publisher=[[Sky News]] |accessdate=25 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, both Arrizabalaga and Sarri said that the situation was a misunderstanding, with Sarri incorrectly believing that Arrizabalaga was too injured with a cramp to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maurizio Sarri: Kepa Arrizabalaga incident a 'misunderstanding', says Chelsea boss |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47352319 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Arrizabalaga met with Sarri and apologised to him and to the rest of the club. He was fined a week's worth of pay as a result of his actions, with Sarri leaving the decision of any further discipline up to the club, due to the club rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47365945 |title=Kepa Arrizabalaga: Chelsea goalkeeper fined &amp; apologises for Wembley incident |date=25 February 2019 |website=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrizabalaga was dropped from the starting lineup for Caballero in Chelsea's next match, a Premier League game against Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/its-a-message-to-the-group-sarri-explains-reasoning-for-dropping-/fei9ryhrddhg13xh86pt31i0v|title='It's a message to the group' - Sarri explains reasoning for dropping Kepa|publisher=Goal.com|date=28 February 2019|accessdate=1 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he went overseas, joining German [[Bundesliga]] outfit [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. With most teams in the country playing in a [[Formation (association football)|5–3–2 or 3–5–2 formation]], his tremendous offensive ability was put to good use, and he scored five goals for Bayer during [[1991–92 Bundesliga|his third and final season]].

Staying in the country, Jorginho signed with league giants [[FC Bayern Munich]] in [[1992–93 Bundesliga|1992–93]], backed by a defensive line which included [[Olaf Thon]], [[Thomas Helmer]] and later [[Lothar Matthäus]]. He won the national title in his second year but, after the loan return of [[Markus Babbel]], a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]] which also operated on [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|the right flank]], was restricted to just ten league contests in 1994–95.

After still appearing with success for [[J. League]]'s [[Kashima Antlers]], winning both [[J. League Division 1|the league]] and [[List of J-League Player of the Year|MVP]] titles in [[1996 J. League|1996]], Jorginho returned to Brazil and played until 39, with [[São Paulo FC]], [[CR Vasco da Gama]] and [[Fluminense Football Club]]. In 2001, he paired at Vasco with both [[Romário]] and [[Bebeto]], but did not seem to get along with the pair.

===International===
Jorginho was capped 64 times for the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]], scoring three goals. He played at both the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s.

In the latter edition, he played all the matches as the nation emerged victorious. Jorginho was [[Penalty card#Yellow card|booked]] in the second-round match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], but was named in the [[FIFA World Cup awards#All-Star Team|All-Star squad]] a few days later. He contributed two assists in the tournament, including a cross in the semifinals against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] that helped Romário score the winning goal. He also performed solidly against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], including a play in which he freed himself from a double-team. However, he got injured after just twenty minutes of play, and was replaced by [[Cafú]].

In 2006, Jorginho was hired as the head coach of first side América. However, on 31 July of that same year, he was hired as Brazil's assistant, joining the staff of former national side teammate [[Dunga]]. In two 2008 [[Exhibition game|friendlies]], he took over for the head manager, following Dunga's dismissal in the previous game and subsequent ban from the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]; he led the team to two 1–0 wins, against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=480289&amp;cc=4716 | title = Dunga banned for four games by Brazilian tribunal | publisher = [[ESPN Soccernet]] | date = 8 November 2007 | accessdate = 19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/braz-coach-triv.html | title = Brazilian National Team Coaches | publisher = [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate = 19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both left the national team following the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] quarterfinal loss against [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]].

Internationally, Jorginho also helped [[Brazil Olympic football team|the Olympic team]] [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|win silver]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|63515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
Jorginho started his managerial career with his first club America in 2005. In the following year, he was appointed [[Dunga]]'s assistant at the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]], remaining with the role until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://extra.globo.com/esporte/auxiliar-d-dunga-entre-2006-2010-na-selecao-jorginho-elogia-escolha-da-cbf-13338689.html|title=Auxiliar de Dunga entre 2006 e 2010 na seleção, Jorginho elogia escolha da CBF|trans-title=Dunga's assistant between 2006 and 2010 at the ''Seleção'', Jorginho praises CBF's choice|publisher=Extra|language=pt|date=22 July 2014|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ross Barkley''' (born 5 December 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

He signed for Chelsea in January 2018.

Barkley made his full international debut in 2013. He played for England at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and was selected in [[Roy Hodgson]]'s 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] but did not appear in any of England's matches.

His time in Spain saw him win honours including three [[La Liga]] titles, and score 107 goals in 190 league appearances. He joined Italian side [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] for €40 million in July 2013, where he won the [[Coppa Italia]] during his first season. In the [[2015–16 Serie A|2015–16 season]], he scored 36 league goals, winning the ''[[Capocannoniere]]'' title and equalling [[Gino Rossetti]]'s 87-year-old record for goals in an Italian top-flight season. As a result of his goal scoring exploits in Naples, Italian champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] signed him for €90 million in 2016, making him the most expensive South American footballer of all time (until Neymar's transfer to PSG in 2017); his transfer fee was the highest ever paid by an Italian team (until [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s transfer to Juventus in 2018) and also the highest of a player transferring within any domestic league (until [[Kylian Mbappé]]'s transfer to PSG in 2018).&lt;ref name="Gonzalo Higuaín: Argentina Striker joins Juventus from Napoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36874091|title=Gonzalo Higuain: Argentina Striker joins Juventus from Napoli|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won domestic doubles in his first two seasons with Juventus, also reaching the [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|2017 Champions League final]] with the club. In 2018, he was loaned to [[A.C. Milan]], and later in 2019 he was loaned to [[Chelsea FC]].

Higuaín has been a full international for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] since 2009; he has represented the country at three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and three [[Copa América]] tournaments, helping them to second-place finishes at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa América]], and the [[Copa América Centenario]] in 2016.

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Higuaín started playing in the youth teams and made his debut with [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] in a 2–1 defeat against [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP)]] on 29 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canchallena.com/1193372-higuain-los-convence-a-todos Higuain los convence a todos (Higuain convinces all)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226012709/http://www.canchallena.com/1193372-higuain-los-convence-a-todos |date=26 February 2012 }} canchallena.com, 2 November 2009, in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2006, he scored his first league goal in a 3–1 victory over [[Club Atlético Banfield|Banfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Match_List&amp;PLID=191762&amp;ListType=9&amp;TEID=543&amp;Season=2005%20-%202006&amp;mTEID=3375&amp;t=3 |title=Gonzalo Higuaín All goals 2005–2006 (Boca Juniors) |publisher=Guardian Stats |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higuaín ended the [[2005–06 Argentine Primera División|2005–06 season]] with 5 goals in 12 appearances.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=191762&amp;TEID=543 |title=Gonzalo Higuaín Facts |publisher=Guardian Stats |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127204526/http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=191762&amp;TEID=543 |archivedate=27 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his [[brace (sports)|brace]] in the ''[[Superclásico]]'' [[Local derby|derby]] against [[Boca Juniors]] on 8 October 2006, River Plate manager [[Daniel Passarella]] declared that Higuaín had an "enormous future" and was "destined for superstardom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Real Madrid===
====2006–07 season====
In December 2006, Spanish club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] signed Higuaín for [[Euro|€]]12&amp;nbsp;million from River Plate. His debut came on 11 January 2007 against [[Real Betis]] in the second round of the [[Copa del Rey]] in [[Seville]]. His first league game came three days later, on 14 January 2007, against [[Real Zaragoza]] at home. Higuaín was involved in the creation of numerous scoring chances and in the assistance for the only goal, which earned Madrid the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/01/14/spain/primera-division/real-madrid-club-de-futbol/real-zaragoza/389446/|title=Real Madrid vs. Real Zaragoza 1 – 0|publisher=Soccerway|date=14 January 2007|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal with Real came on 24 February when the team faced [[Atlético Madrid]] in the [[Madrid derby]], the equaliser (1–1) at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/02/24/spain/primera-division/club-atletico-de-madrid/real-madrid-club-de-futbol/389502/|title=Atlético Madrid vs. Real Madrid 1 – 1|publisher=Soccerway|date=24 February 2007|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first season at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Bernabéu]], however, Higuaín raised some doubts over his performance due to his overall lack of goals.

====2007–08 season====
During the [[2007–08 Real Madrid C.F. season|2007–08 season]], Higuaín played inconsistently, although he finished strongly at the end of the season: He first scored a last minute goal to earn his team a victory in a 2–1 comeback against [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], which allowed Real Madrid to be mathematically crowned Liga champions for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2007_08/primera/jornada_35/osa_rma/asilovivimos.html |title=www.Marca.com |publisher=Marca.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he scored the third goal of a 4–1 thrashing of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in ''[[El Clásico]]''. The goal was scored just 57 seconds after he came off the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/Barca/saca/hombros/Madrid/elpepidep/20080508elpepidep_2/Tes |title=El Barça saca a hombros al Madrid |work=El Pais |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
In the [[2008–09 Real Madrid C.F. season|2008–09 season]], Higuaín was offered the chance to be a starter due to a serious injury suffered by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/Higuain/Espero/lesion/Van/Nistelrooy/signifique/retirada/elpepudep/20081113elpepudep_17/Tes |title=Higuaín: "Espero que la lesión de Van Nistelrooy no signifique su retirada" |work=El Pais |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Higuaín scored the winner in Madrid's victory over [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the [[Supercopa de España]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivo.marca.com/futbol/2008/supercopa/index.html Supercopa 2008] Marca.com. Retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he scored all four goals in a 4–3 win against [[Málaga CF|Málaga]]. Because of this, he started to gain international recognition and became one of the leading goalscorers of La Liga, alongside his Barcelona counterpart [[Samuel Eto'o]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/2008/11/08/mardid_malaga_recap/ |title=Higuain, Eto'o both notch four goals |publisher=Sportsnet.ca |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315014049/http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/2008/11/08/mardid_malaga_recap/ |archive-date=15 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2009, Higuaín played very well in the match against [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] and scored the decisive goal in the last minute, giving Real Madrid a 3–2 victory which enabled the team to keep close to [[Pep Guardiola]]'s Barcelona in the league table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/higuain-casillas-especialistas-milagros/20090421dasdasftb_60/Tes |title=Higuaín y Casillas, especialistas en milagros – LIGA BBVA , Real Madrid 3 – Getafe 2 |publisher=AS.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season, Higuaín was regarded as one of the most promising talents in world football in the wake of spectacular games and last-minute goals. He ended the season with 22 league goals&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/topscorers?league=esp.1&amp;year=2008&amp;cc=5901 Spanish Primera División – Top Scorers – 2008/2009]. ESPN. Retrieved on 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 24 in all competitions, around as many as established football stars including [[Diego Forlán]], [[David Villa]] and [[Thierry Henry]].

====2009–10 season====
The [[2009–10 Real Madrid C.F. season|2009–10 season]] saw Higuaín become Real's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, 29 in total, being at the same time the La Liga's second-top goalscorer, behind only [[Lionel Messi]] and surpassing Swedish international [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], as well as his Madrid teammate [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. This season included him scoring his first two goals in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and his second [[hat-trick]] for the club.

====2010–11 season====

During the first weeks of December 2010, Higuaín was diagnosed with a herniated lumbar disc, and Real's medical staff suggested that he should have it operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/real-madrid-wait-for-gonzalo-higuain-injury-assessment-2150267.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=Real Madrid wait for Gonzalo Higuain injury assessment | date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2011, Real Madrid announced he would finally undergo surgery at the Department of Neurological Surgery of [[Chicago]]'s [[Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine]] under the command of Dr. Richard G.

On 29 August 2012, Higuaín scored the opener in an eventual 2–1 win against Barcelona in the second leg of the [[2012 Supercopa de España]], which secured Real Madrid its first title of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/real-madrid/9507759/Real-Madrid-2-Barcelona-1-4-4-agg-match-report.html|title=Real Madrid 2 Barcelona 1 (4-4 agg): match report|publisher=The Telegraph|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoli===
Due to Higuaín's availability, clubs like [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] were keen to sign him. Higuaín was at the centre of much transfer speculation, with many newspapers linking him to a move to Arsenal before Napoli's president [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]] said that Higuaín, along with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] goalkeeper [[Pepe Reina]], had passed their medicals and that the Argentine had signed a five-year deal with the [[Italy|Italian]] club, with Higuaín joining for [[Euro|€]]40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=1506002&amp;cc=5901 |title=Higuain and Reina pass Napoli medicals |publisher=ESPNFC |date=24 July 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, Napoli confirmed the signing of Higuaín, with the Argentine being assigned the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=1508152&amp;cc=5901 |title=Napoli confirm Higuain signing |publisher=ESPNFC |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Copa América===
With [[Sergio Agüero]] preferred as the lone centre-forward in a three-man Argentine attack, Higuaín made his first start of the [[2015 Copa América]] in the final [[2015 Copa América Group B|group]] match, against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] in [[Viña del Mar]].

A hardworking striker and a prolific goalscorer, Higuaín is considered to be one of the top strikers of his generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/09/strikers-premier-league-gonzalo-higuain|title=Every club wants one but where have all the (good) strikers gone?|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Amy Lawrence|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/75003/prandelli-%E2%80%98higuain-best-around%E2%80%99|title=Prandelli: ‘Higuain best around’|publisher=Football Italia|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known in particular for his great striking ability,&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnapoli.it/Squadra/Gonzalo-Higuain|title=Prima Squadra – SSC Napoli|publisher=|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212070151/http://www.sscnapoli.it/Squadra/Gonzalo-Higuain|archive-date=12 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his opportunism and clinical finishing inside the penalty area, while his height, eye for goal, and strong physique make him a dangerous aerial presence in the box. He also possesses good technical skills, and an ability to link-up with teammates, hold up the ball, and lay it off to other players. His intelligent offensive movement off the ball and pace in the final third of the pitch make him an offensive threat during counter-attacks, and also allow him to lose his markers and get on the end of passes, or create space for his teammates with his attacking runs.&lt;ref name="El Pìpita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brilliant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2440254.html|title=How brilliant is Juventus' Gonzalo Higuaín?|publisher=UEFA.com|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higuaín Finds Comfort in Columbus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/higuain-finds-comfort-in-columbus/|title=Higuaín Finds Comfort in Columbus|publisher=The New York Times|author=Eric Beard|date=14 September 2012|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his team-play, he has also operated as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]] on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/116818/crespo-%E2%80%99play-icardi-higuain%E2%80%99 |title=Crespo: ’Play Icardi with Higuain’ |publisher=Football Italia |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=2 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-struggling-juventus-max-10213736 |title=With Arsene Wenger struggling, Juventus' Max Allegri gave Arsenal food for thought with spot-on tactics to stun Barcelona |publisher=The Daily Mirror |author1=Darren Lewis |date=12 April 2017 |accessdate=2 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His playing style has earned him comparisons with compatriots [[Hernán Crespo]] and Gabriel Batistuta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2011/10/18/2717055/hernan-crespo-real-madrids-gonzalo-higuain-is-my-natural|title=Hernan Crespo: Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higuain is my natural successor in the Argentina national team|publisher=Goal.com|author1=Daniel Edwards|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penpix of likely Argentina squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-world-penpix-argentina-idUSKBN0DF06J20140429|title=Penpix of likely Argentina squad for World Cup finals|publisher=Reuters|author1=Rex Gowar|date=28 April 2014|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his impressive scoring record, Higuaín has often been criticized for failing to deliver in the most important of matches for both club and country.

Hazard spent two years in the club's academy and, at the age of 16, made his professional debut in November 2007. He went on to become an integral part of the Lille team under manager [[Rudi Garcia]], racking up over 190 appearances. In his first full season as a starter, he won the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award, becoming the first non-French player to win the award.&lt;ref name="Lille OSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eden Hazard prolonge son contrat au LOSC|url=http://www.losc.fr/?r=0,0,18,4500|publisher=Lille OSC|accessdate=10 April 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]], Hazard captured the award again, becoming the first player to win the award twice.&lt;ref name="young_player"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hazard named Young Player of Year|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/hazard-named-young-player-of-year.htm|publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel|date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named to the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]].

==Early life==
Hazard was born in [[La Louvière]] and grew up in [[Braine-le-Comte]]. His mother, Carine, and father, Thierry, were both footballers. His father spent most of his career at [[semi-professional]] level with [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louvière]] in the [[Belgian Second Division]],&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/les-hazard-une-famille-de-foot-13-05-2011-1447493.php | title = Les Hazard, une famille de foot | date = 15 March 2011 | accessdate = 19 December 2011 |work=Le Parisien | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; playing mainly as a [[defensive midfielder]].&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt; His mother played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] in the [[Belgian Women's First Division]] and stopped playing when she was three months pregnant with Eden.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eden_family"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/LOSC/2010/01/29/article_avant-d-etre-partagee-entre-lille-et-len.shtml|title=Avant d'être partagée entre Lille et Lens, la famille Hazard a cultivé son jardin secret|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|work=La Voix des Sports|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing football, both parents became sports teachers.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt; Thierry retired from his position in 2009 in order to devote more time to his children.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt;

Hazard is the eldest of four children. He has three brothers, all of whom play football, including [[Thorgan Hazard|Thorgan]], who joined him at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2012 but then moved to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31590137|last=|first=|title=Chelsea man to stay at Borussia Mönchengladbach|date=24 February 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorgan had previously progressed through the youth ranks of Lille's [[Derby du Nord|biggest rivals]] [[RC Lens|Lens]].&lt;ref name="Eden Hazard brother Thorgan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thorgan Hozard joins Chelsea |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2859608,00.html |work=[[Chelsea F.C.]] |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726143551/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10268~2859608%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eden_hazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html|title=Eden Hazard, protection rapprochée|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=10 April 2010|publisher=FIFA|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501150142/http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html|archivedate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |title=Eden est entouré de professionnels |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=10 April 2010 |publisher=Foot Goal |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105084607/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |archivedate= 5 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |title=L'interview découverte de Thorgan Hazard |accessdate=10 March 2010 |publisher=Lensois |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313121407/http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |archivedate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard's other younger brothers are [[Kylian Hazard|Kylian]] and Ethan.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Hazard began his football career playing for hometown club Royal Stade Brainois at the age of four. During his time at the club, one of his youth coaches described him as a "gifted" player. He added: "He knew everything. I had nothing to teach him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |title=À Braine-le-Comte, sur les traces d'Eden Hazard |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011 |publisher=Nord Éclair |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422040603/http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |archivedate=22 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard spent eight years at the club before moving to [[A.F.C. Tubize|Tubize]]. While at Tubize, he was spotted by a Lille scout while playing in a local tournament with the club. The scout's subsequent report on the player prompted club officials to meet with Hazard's father and offer the young player an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract.&lt;ref name="eden_contract"&gt;{{cite news |title=8 nouveaux professionnels au LOSC|url=http://www.losc.fr/?r=0,0,14,20|work=[[Lille OSC]] |accessdate=10 April 2010 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazard's parents accepted the offer from Lille with hopes that the training facilities in France would be better.&lt;ref name="eden_hazard2"/&gt; Hazard's father later admitted that the decision to let Eden and, later Thorgan, join clubs in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|North of France]] was the best solution stating "They remained so close to home and, at the same time, they integrated at structures where they could grow, because in Belgium, unfortunately, it's a little empty for the training of youth".&lt;ref name="eden_family"/&gt;

===Lille===
Hazard joined Lille in 2005 and spent two years developing in the club's local sports school, due to its youth academy in Luchin not being in operation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/video/videoid=1683656.html?autoplay=true|title=Lille's Hazard looks back and forward to Trabzonspor|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=27 September 2011|publisher=[[UEFA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2007, he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Lille.&lt;ref name="eden_contract"/&gt; At the start of the [[2007-08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]], at the age of 16, Hazard was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of [[Football in France|French football]], though he still played with Lille's under-18 team in its league and the [[Coupe Gambardella]]. Hazard made his amateur debut on 1 September 2007 in a league match against [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Club de France]] appearing as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losc.fr/?saison=20072008&amp;r=0,2,5,,2,413|title=Racing CF 92 3–1 LOSC 2|date=1 September 2007|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=Lille OSC|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start a week later in the team's 1–0 defeat to [[US Lesquin|Lesquin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losc.fr/?saison=20072008&amp;r=0,2,5,,2,427|title=LOSC 2 0–1 Lesquin|date=9 September 2007|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=Lille OSC|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending the majority of October and the early part of November playing with the club's under-18 team, on 14 November, due to several players being on international duty, Hazard was called up to the senior team by manager [[Claude Puel]] to participate in a friendly match against Belgian club [[FC Bruges|Bruges]] on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losc.fr/?r=0,0,14,1684|title=Formation: carton plein des 18 ans Nationaux!|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=Lille OSC|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a substitute in the match and, as a result of his performance, was included in the 18-man squad to face [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] in a league match on 24 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losc.fr/?saison=20072008&amp;r=0,2,5,,1,24|title=FC Bruges 1–3 LOSC|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=19 April 2011|publisher=Lille OSC|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard, subsequently, made his professional debut in the match coming on as a substitute in the 78th&amp;nbsp;minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy v.

Hazard returned to the club's reserve team and spent December playing with the squad. Following the winter break, Hazard returned to the first team in January and made substitute appearances in three league matches against [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lille v.

==International career==
===Youth===
Hazard played for various Belgian national youth teams, such as the [[Belgium national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Belgium national under-19 football team|under-19]] teams.

In the tournament, Hazard scored his only goal in the team's opening match against the [[Netherlands national under-17 football team|Netherlands]] converting a penalty in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High drama for Low Countries |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under17/history/season=2007/round=2248/match=300748/index.html |publisher=UEFA |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209182240/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under17/history/season%3D2007/round%3D2248/match%3D300748/index.html |archivedate= 9 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was a homecoming for Hazard, as it was played in Tubize, where he spent part of his youth career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy homecoming for Hazard by Berend Scholten|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=534653.html|publisher=UEFA|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the tournament, Hazard impressed media and coaches, which led to many in Belgium comparing him to Belgian football legend [[Enzo Scifo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden boys boost Red Devils|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1042027.html|publisher=FIFA|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Under 17 World Cup – Day 6 |url=http://www.soccermogul.com/under_17_world_cup_day_6.aspx |publisher=Soccer Mogul |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018231507/http://www.soccermogul.com/under_17_world_cup_day_6.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El belga Eden Hazard, de 18 años, sigue mejorando con el Lille en la Ligue 1 francesa |url=http://www.futbolexclusivo.com/el-jugador-de-belga-eden-hazard-de-18-anos-sigue-mejorando-con-el-lille-en-la-ligue-1-de-francia/ |publisher=Futbol Exclusivo |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221652/http://www.futbolexclusivo.com/el-jugador-de-belga-eden-hazard-de-18-anos-sigue-mejorando-con-el-lille-en-la-ligue-1-de-francia/ |archivedate=27 May 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium suffered elimination in the semi-finals of the competition, losing to [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]] 7–6 on penalties.

After playing at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in August and September 2007, Hazard began earning call-ups to the under-19 team the following month in October. His first appearance came in a [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification]] match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] coming on as a substitute in a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium v.

Due to being an underage player the previous year, Hazard was eligible for the under-19 team for the 2008–09 season. Due to his growing participation with Lille's first team, Hazard was only allowed to play in [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification]] matches by his club and, as a result, missed the 2008 edition of the [[Milk Cup]], which was held during Lille's preseason.

===Early senior===
On 18 November 2008, Hazard was called up to the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium senior team]], for the first time, by manager [[René Vandereycken]] for the team's match against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. Prior to making his national team debut with Belgium, Hazard was courted by [[French Football Federation]] officials who sought the player to play for the [[France national football team|France national team]] as he had become eligible for French citizenship. Hazard did not respond to the courtship and later stated "Because of my presence in France for seven years, I feel 99% Belgian and 1% French, but the idea of French citizenship has never crossed my mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eden Hazard aurait pu jouer avec les Bleus | url = http://www.chronofoot.com/%E9quipe-de-france/eden-hazard-aurait-pu-jouer-avec-les-bleus_art21429.html |publisher=Chronofoot |date=15 November 2011 | accessdate = 19 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazard made his highly anticipated debut for Belgium in the match against Luxembourg coming on as a substitute in the 67th&amp;nbsp;minute for [[Wesley Sonck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Belgium v.

Under Advocaat, Hazard became a starter in the team and, on 14 November 2009, played a full match for the first time in his international career. In the match, which was played against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], Hazard assisted on two goals in a 3–0 win.

In May 2010, Advocaat was replaced as manager by [[Georges Leekens]]. After featuring as a starter in Leekens first three matches in charge, Hazard began appearing as a substitute for Belgium during the 2010–11 season. Leekens justified his benching of Hazard citing the players' domestic performance, which had been underwhelming at the time, while also admitting that Hazard displayed a lack of desire in training with the national team and often neglected his defensive duties during international matches.&lt;ref name="hazard_leekens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hazard-Leekens: l'incompréhension? |url=http://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/diablesrouges/detail_hazard-leekens-l-incomprehension?id=6550763|work=RTBF.be|date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing as a substitute in two straight matches, Hazard returned to the starting lineup for the team's November 2010 friendly match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]].

After featuring as a starter in the team's 1–1 draw with [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in February 2011, Hazard was relegated back to the substitute's bench for the team's important March 2011 [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] matches as Leekens preferred [[Nacer Chadli]] and [[Mousa Dembélé (footballer, born 1987)|Mousa Dembélé]] on the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Un problème Hazard? |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2011/20110329_091853_un-probleme-hazard.html|work=[[L'Equipe]]|date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's 29 March qualifier against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], he appeared as a second-half substitute and assisted on the team's final goal in a 4–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Belgique flambe avec Hazard |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/154831/la-belgique-flambe-avec-hazard/ |work=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907183753/http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/154831/la-belgique-flambe-avec-hazard/ |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the matches, French media began questioning why Hazard was struggling to be appreciated in his home country, while, at the same time, was being praised in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hazard n'est pas prophète en son plat pays |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |work=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005505/http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Wilmots, assistant coach of the national team, responded to the media reports stating "Some people only see Eden's qualities" and "the French press are sometimes blinded by his moments of magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilmots: Hazard needs more than talent|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1409933.html|publisher=FIFA|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium's next competitive match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 3 June 2011, Hazard started the match, but was substituted out after 60 minutes.

On 7 June 2015, due to the suspension of regular skipper [[Vincent Kompany]], Hazard captained Belgium for the first time in a friendly against [[France national football team|France]] at the [[Stade de France]], scoring a penalty for Belgium's final goal in a 4–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eden Hazard après France-Belgique (3–4): "Un très bon match même si nous aurions pu inscrire encore davantage de buts"|trans-title=Eden Hazard after France 3–4 Belgium: "A very good match even though we could have scored even more goals"|url=http://www.sudinfo.be/1305587/article/2015-06-07/eden-hazard-apres-france-belgique-3-4-un-tres-bon-match-meme-si-nous-aurions-pu|accessdate=7 June 2015|publisher=Sudinfo|date=7 June 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won another penalty in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match on 3 September when fouled by [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Ognjen Vranješ]], and converted it past his Chelsea clubmate [[Asmir Begović]] to conclude Belgium's 3–1 comeback victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ridge|first1=Patric|title=Belgium 3–1 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Fellaini, De Bruyne &amp; Hazard get the job done|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/belgium-vs-bosnia-herzegovina/1653302|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he finished Mertens' cross with four minutes remaining, for the only goal in an away win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyprus 0–1 Belgium: Late Hazard strike dashes Wales hopes...for now|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/cyprus-vs-belgium/1653330/report|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, Hazard scored a spot-kick again after [[Óscar Sonejee]]'s handball, in a 4–1 win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] which sealed Belgium's qualification to the continental championship for the first time since co-hosting [[UEFA Euro 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium claim Euro 2016 spot by trashing Andorra 4–1|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/10/uk-soccer-euro-andorra-idUKKCN0S40WT20151010|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Reuters|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Hazard taking on Howson.jpg|thumb|left|Hazard taking on the [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] defence for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in October 2012]]

Hazard primarily plays as either an [[Attacking midfielders|attacking midfielder]] or a [[Left winger|winger]] and has been credited as being "possibly the outstanding talent in Europe right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new Belgian golden generation|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/770540/wim-van-walle-the-new-belgian-golden-generation|publisher=ESPN FC|first=Wim|last=Van Walle|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Lille under former manager Rudi Garcia, Hazard often played in the latter role in the team's 4–3–3 formation and regularly switched flanks because he could use both feet. Following the departures of fellow [[Playmaker|play-makers]] [[Yohan Cabaye]] and [[Gervinho]] in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, Garcia played Hazard in a creative role as a central attacking midfielder, while also allowing the player to roam back onto the wing if necessary. Two of Hazard's most common exemplary traits are his pace and [[Dribbling#Association football|technical ability]], which have been described as "astonishing" and "mesmerizing".&lt;ref name="hazard_fifa"/&gt; His speed and dribbling skills, combined with his creativity,&lt;ref name="hazard_espn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eden Hazard|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/101390/eden-hazard|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" St Etienne v Lille"/&gt;&lt;ref name="targets"/&gt; as well as his flair, balance, agility, and low centre of gravity, courtesy of his diminutive stature (1.73 m/5 feet 8 inches),&lt;ref name="Chelsea profile"/&gt; allow him to retain possession, take on defenders, and beat opponents in one on one situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1978449-eden-hazard-what-makes-him-the-best-player-in-the-premier-league |title=Eden Hazard Showing Class That Makes Him Best Player in the Premier League |publisher=bleacherreport.com |last1=Levene |first1=Dan |date=2 March 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/3188122/eden-hazard-among-chelsea-stars-put-through-speed-dribbling-test |title=Eden Hazard among Chelsea stars put through speed dribbling test |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Twomey |first1=Liam |date=25 August 2017 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/are-romelu-lukaku-dries-mertens-and-eden-hazard-the-world-cup-s--82060 |title=Are Lukaku, Mertens &amp; Hazard the World Cup's most complete attacking partnership? |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |date=18 June 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.squawka.com/en/news/eden-hazard-ballon-dor/30473#g9LEXKMWOK20vLqW.97 |title=Eden's Era?

Hazard's pace, coupled with his finishing and ability to retain possession, led to his former coach [[Claude Puel]] dubbing him "little [[Lionel Messi|Messi]]", in reference to the [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] player.&lt;ref name="hazard_sportsillustrated"/&gt; Puel's sentiments were later echoed by former [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] manager and [[media personality]] [[Rolland Courbis]] who commented "At times it looks to me like Lionel Messi on the right-hand side".&lt;ref name="hazard_fourfourtwo"/&gt; Hazard's "flair and tricky" style of play has been described as being similar to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] player [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]; a comparison later repeated by former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Christophe Dugarry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The next Cristiano Ronaldo, Eden Hazard declares interest in sealing summer move to Arsenal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1215822/The-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Eden-Hazard-declares-sealing-summer-Arsenal.html|work=Daily Mail|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=19 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dugarry compare Eden Hazard à Cristiano Ronaldo |url=http://www.topfoot.com/5452,1/lille-dugarry-compare-eden-hazard-a-cristiano-ronaldo.html |publisher=Topfoot |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331065907/http://www.topfoot.com/5452%2C1/lille-dugarry-compare-eden-hazard-a-cristiano-ronaldo.html |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His vision, described as being the trait he has improved on the most, has also allowed him to develop into an effective passer,&lt;ref name="hazard_france24"&gt;{{cite news|title=Football: Eden Hazard, le Messi(e) de Lille |url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20110314-football-eden-hazard-le-messie-lille |work=[[France 24]] |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408120511/http://www.france24.com/fr/20110314-football-eden-hazard-le-messie-lille |archivedate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, combined with his finishing ability, enables him to both score and create goals.&lt;ref name="next Messi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheda giocatore"/&gt;

In Belgium, Hazard's talent and similar ascension up the country's football hierarchy has led to comparisons to former Belgian international [[Enzo Scifo]].&lt;ref name="eden_hazard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hazard_scifo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enzo Scifo adoube son héritier: "Eden Hazard, c'est le talent"|url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/LOSC/2010/11/23/article_enzo-scifo-adoube-son-heritier-eden-haz.shtml|work=La Voix des Sports|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both players share the same birthplace and Scifo himself spent time with Hazard while he was in Tubize admitting "Eden, you know, I've coached in Tubize. During the week, I took care of the young people at least once, and he, in those days, I immediately saw he had a secure future".&lt;ref name="hazard_scifo"/&gt;

However, despite the positive opinions, Hazard has endured criticism from some. In 2010, former Belgium national team manager Georges Leekens questioned Hazard's work-rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium play down talk of Hazard spat|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/900525/belgium-play-down-talk-of-eden-hazard-spat|publisher=ESPN FC|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme countered both managers' criticism by arguing that Hazard simply possesses an intellectual honesty that is out of the ordinary and unexpected of today's footballer declaring "He is a real competitor, not a cheat, nor a moaner, because you don't hear him complaining when he gets fouled".&lt;ref name="hazard_fourfourtwo"/&gt;

===Personal life===

EA Sports.

Since March 2016, Hazard has been appearing in adverts for Belgium-based [[Lotus Bakeries]] promoting their Biscoff biscuit range. The advert shows him successfully taking a [[free kick]], sending a ball into a gap in 10,000 cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/eden-hazard-takes-the-biscuit-watch-chelsea-star-avoid-smashing-10000-coffee-cups-in-free-kick-a3205066.html |title=Eden Hazard takes the biscuit!

'''Pedro''' (alternate archaic spelling '''Pêro'''){{cn|date=June 2018}} is a masculine given name. Pedro is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Galician language|Galician]] name for ''[[Peter (given name)|Peter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfnames.com/mnames/p/origin-and-meaning-of-pedro.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Pedro]&lt;/ref&gt; Its French equivalent is [[Pierre]] while its English and Germanic form is Peter.

The counterpart [[patronymic]] [[surname]] of the name Pedro, meaning "son of Peter" (compare with the English surname [[Peterson (name)|Peterson]]) is [[Pérez]] in Spanish, and [[Peres]] in Galician and Portuguese, [[Pires (disambiguation)|Pires]] also in Portuguese, and [[Peiris]] in coastal area of [[Sri Lanka]] (where it originated from the Portuguese version), with all ultimately meaning "son of Pêro".

The name Pedro is derived via the Latin word "petra", from the Greek word "η πετρα" meaning "stone, rock".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfnames.com/mnames/p/origin-and-meaning-of-peter.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Peter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Peter (name)|Peter]] itself is a translation of the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''Kephas'' or ''[[Aramaic of Jesus#Cephas_.28.CE.9A.CE.B7.CF.86.CE.B1.CF.82.29|Cephas]]'' meaning "stone".

'''Wilfredo Daniel''' "'''Willy'''" '''Caballero Lazcano''' (born 28 September 1981) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

He spent most of his career in Spain, representing [[Elche CF|Elche]] and [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] and competing in [[La Liga]] with the latter club. In the summer of 2014 he signed for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], helping them win the [[2016 Football League Cup Final|2016 League Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Santa Elena, Entre Ríos]], Caballero started his playing career with [[Boca Juniors]] in 2001, where he won three major titles in 2003. On 14 December of that year he witnessed&amp;nbsp;– from [[Substitute (association football)|the bench]]&amp;nbsp;– his team beat [[A.C. Milan]] 3–1 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]], in the [[2003 Intercontinental Cup|2003]] [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]].&lt;ref name=ICUP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mundod.lavoz.com.ar/futbol/10-anos-del-titulo-intercontinental-de-boca-ante-milan#!/login|title=A 10 años del título Intercontinental de Boca ante Milan|trans-title=10 years from Boca's Intercontinental title against Milan|newspaper=[[La Voz del Interior]]|language=es|date=14 December 2013|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero joined [[Elche CF|Elche]] of [[Spain]] in 2004, and when his daughter was diagnosed with cancer he agreed to a brief loan spell back in his country with [[Arsenal de Sarandí]] to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivoox.com/22436520|title=Padre antes que portero|trans-title=Father before goalkeeper|publisher=Ivoox|language=es|date=4 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the former, after a rough [[2004–05 Segunda División|first season]], he went on to become the undisputed starter, appearing in nearly 200 [[Segunda División]] games.

===Málaga===
On 10 February 2011, Caballero was transferred to [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in [[La Liga]] for [[Euro|€]]900,000 and two-and-a-half years, as an emergency transfer&amp;nbsp;– after the transfer deadline of 31 January&amp;nbsp;– due to a serious [[knee]] injury to [[Sergio Asenjo]] (their previous starter, [[Rubén Iván Martínez|Rubén]], was also unavailable due to physical problems);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2011/02/11/2348382/official-malaga-sign-willy-caballero-from-elche|title=Official: Malaga sign Willy Caballero from Elche|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|last=Mondal|first=Subhankar|date=11 February 2011|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made his league debut on 20 February, starting in a 1–1 draw at [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/302121?cc=5739|title=Villarreal left disappointed again|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=20 February 2011|accessdate=28 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628234200/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/302121?cc=5739|archivedate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played all the matches until the end of [[2010–11 La Liga|the campaign]], with the [[Andalusia]]ns finally escaping relegation.

On 1 October 2011, Caballero entered Málaga's history books as he kept his [[Shutout|goal clean]] for 480 minutes, beating the club's previous record of 429 held by [[Pedro Contreras]] since the [[2001–02 La Liga|2001–02 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malagacf/2011/10/02/willy-caballero-historia-viva-malaga-cf/454131.html|title=Willy Caballero ya es historia viva del Málaga CF|trans-title=Willy Caballero becomes living history at Málaga CF|newspaper=La Opinión de Málaga|last=Puga|first=Manu|language=es|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October, he was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] midway through the first half of an away fixture against [[Levante UD|Levante]] after touching the ball with his hands just outside the box&amp;nbsp;– the hosts eventually won it 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/323959?cc=5739|title=Levante go second|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720133452/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/323959?cc=5739|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2012, Caballero signed a contract extension, tying him to the club until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malagacf.com/es/noticia/actualidad/willy-caballero-amplia-su-vinculacion-malaga-club-futbol-temporada-20152016/131/56271|title=Willy Caballero amplía su vinculación con el Málaga Club de Fútbol hasta la temporada 2015–2016|trans-title=Willy Caballero extends Málaga Club de Fútbol link until 2015–2016 season|publisher=Málaga CF|language=es|date=18 January 2012|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March, playing against [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], he fractured his left [[hand]] early into the game, being sidelined for the rest of [[2011–12 La Liga|the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/03/27/futbol/equipos/malaga/1332875721.html|title=Caballero se operará de la fractura en su mano|trans-title=Caballero to undergo hand fracture surgery|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=es|date=27 March 2012|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero returned to full fitness for [[2012–13 La Liga|2012–13]], featuring in all but two games and helping the ''Boquerones'' to the sixth position. Goal.com named him as the best player in his position for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2013/05/14/3977718/la-liga-team-of-the-season-messi-ronaldo-falcao-make-up-all-star-|title=La Liga Team of the Season: Messi, Ronaldo &amp; Falcao make up all-star front line|publisher=Goal|date=14 May 2013|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[2013–14 La Liga|the following season]], he was nominated as the best goalkeeper in the league alongside [[Thibaut Courtois]] of [[Atlético Madrid]] and [[Keylor Navas]] of Levante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/chelsea-duo-thibaut-courtois-filipe-luis-nominated-la-liga-awards-1470026|title=Chelsea duo Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis nominated for La Liga awards|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|last =Fernandez-Abascal|first=Eduardo|date=14 October 2014|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reunited at his new club with former Málaga manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football-28195661|title=Willy Caballero: Man City sign Malaga goalkeeper for £4.4m|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=5 August 2015|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140709172255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football-28195661|archive-date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his competitive debut came on 10 August in the [[2014 FA Community Shield]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–3 loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Wembley Stadium]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28647186|title=Arsenal 3–0 Manchester City|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Sanghera|first=Mandeep|date=10 August 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a week later, in the [[Premier League]] opener, he was an unused substitute at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28730044|title=Newcastle United 0–2 Manchester City|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Chowdhury|first=Saj|date=17 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero's second official appearance for City occurred on 24 September 2014, in the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|7–0 home routing]] of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for the [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29233053|title=Manchester City 7–0 Sheffield Wednesday|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first league appearance away against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] three days later, relegating longtime incumbent [[Joe Hart]] to the bench in a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289927|title=Hull City 2–4 Manchester City|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Keegan|first=Mike|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero's third league match was on 26 September 2015, a 1–4 defeat at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] which was described as 'a day to forget'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3250053/Harry-Kane-gets-mark-Willy-Caballero-day-forget-goal-Manchester-City-PLAYER-RATINGS.html|title=Harry Kane gets off the mark as Willy Caballero has a day to forget in goal for Manchester City – Player ratings|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Al-Samarrai|first=Riath|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[2015–16 Premier League|the season]], he was first-choice in the [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]], receiving criticism in the national press before [[2016 Football League Cup Final|the final]] following the [[2015–16 FA Cup|1–5 loss]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[FA Cup]] where he was adjudged to be at fault for two goals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-3465960/HOT-NOT-Manchester-City-huge-gamble-Willy-Caballero-Marc-Andre-Ter-Stegen-proves-worth-Barcelona.html|title=HOT OR NOT: Manchester City to take huge gamble on Willy Caballero while Marc-Andre Ter Stegen proves his worth for Barcelona|newspaper=Daily Mail|last=Ladyman|first=Ian|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3467857/Manchester-City-goalkeeper-Willy-Caballero-shrugs-criticism-amid-calls-Joe-Hart-replace-Capital-One-Cup-final-don-t-care-people-think.html|title=Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero shrugs off criticism amid calls for Joe Hart to replace him in Capital One Cup final: 'I don't care what people think'|newspaper=Daily Mail|last=Banerjee|first=Rohan|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the decisive match at [[Wembley Stadium]], he saved three attempts in the 3–1 penalty shootout triumph against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],&lt;ref name=LCUP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/35264205|title=League Cup final: Man City win on penalties|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Rostance|first=Tom|date=28 February 2016|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pellegrini subsequently said he would rather lose the match to keep his word, whilst several pundits added that both player and manager deserved an apology with some remarking the performance was a lesson in loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35683434|title=Capital One Cup: Manuel Pellegrini's selection policies pay off|publisher=BBC Sport|last=McNulty|first=Phil|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-citys-willy-caballero-owed-10963105|title=Manchester City's Willy Caballero owed an apology after producing stunning League Cup winning display|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|last=Brennan|first=Stuart|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appointment of manager [[Pep Guardiola]] in the 2016 off-season, Caballero became the starter over Hart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-news-pep-guardiola-defends-decision-to-drop-joe-hart-for-in-form-willy-caballero-a7189501.html|title=Manchester City news: Pep Guardiola defends decision to drop Joe Hart for 'in-form' Willy Caballero|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|last=Rich|first=Tim|date=13 August 2016|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, with the signing of [[Claudio Bravo]], he returned to his backup role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/willy-caballero-lavishes-praise-joe-8765211|title=Willy Caballero lavishes praise on Joe Hart and backs him to succeed in Serie A with Torino|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|last=McLeman|first=Neil|date=4 September 2016|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovačić is usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]], but he is considered to be a versatile midfielder, having played in different positions and adapted to playing either [[Midfielder#Winger|wide]] on the left or as an [[midfielder|attacking midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is Inter new boy Mateo Kovacic? |url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/02/who-is-inter-new-boy-mateo-kovacic/ |publisher=Forza Italian Football |date=3 February 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovačić began his professional career with [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the age of 16, with whom he won two consecutive league titles, before joining [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in 2013. After the [[2014–15 Inter Milan season|2014–15 season]], he moved to Real Madrid, where he has won the Champions League on three occasions. A full Croatian international since 2013, Kovačić represented the nation at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], including a runner's up finish in the latter tournament. He is nicknamed ''Il Professore (The Professor).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mateo Kovacic: Scout Report Inter’s creative midfield talent |url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2014/01/23/mateo-kovacic-scout-report/ |publisher=Outside of the Boot |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovavic il migliore con la Croazia, soprannominato dai compagni "il Professore" |url=http://www.diggita.it/story.php?title=Kovavic_il_migliore_con_la_Croazia_soprannominato_dai_compagni_il_Professore-1 |publisher=diggita.it |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Youth career===
Born in [[Linz]], Austria, to [[Bosnian Croat]] parents who had moved there from [[Kotor Varoš]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kovačić began playing at an early age at the local [[LASK Linz]]'s academy.&lt;ref name="zidak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic-kao-maradona--modric--pele---/905740/ |title=Meteor Kovačić: Svi su ludi za dječakom koji je već sa 13 igrao zrelo kao nekad Maradona |last=Židak |first=Tomislav |work=[[Jutarnji list]] |date=22 November 2010 |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, when Kovačić was 13, he was spotted by scouts from several prominent European clubs, including [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Inter Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], but his family opted to move to [[Zagreb]] instead, where he joined the [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb Academy|academy]] of Croatian giants [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="zidak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic--kako-je-stvoren-igrac-od-100-milijuna-kuna/1082758/ |title=Cijela istina o Mateu Kovačiću |last=Cigoj |first=Mark |work=Jutarnji list |date=2 February 2013 |language=Croatian |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kovačić suffered a serious injury in 2009 in which his leg was broken, but he returned to the pitch after a lengthy recovery on 31 May 2010, appearing in the last match of the [[Prva HNL Academy|Croatian under-17 academy league]], a 5–0 win against [[RNK Split]] under-17s.&lt;ref name="kadeti"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/398143/nogomet-1-hnl/kadeti-dinama-za-naslov-prestigli-hajduk |title=Kadeti Dinama za naslov prestigli Hajduk |last=Rupnik |first=Borna |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|Sportnet]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dinamo Zagreb===
Kovačić started training with the club's senior squad under manager, [[Vahid Halilhodžić]], four months later, on 6 October 2010,&lt;ref name="vahid"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic-od-danas-trenira-sa-seniorima-dinama--plasi-me-nadimak-hrvatski-messi/892846/ |title=Mateo Kovačić od danas trenira sa seniorima Dinama: Plaši me nadimak Hrvatski Messi |date=6 October 2010 |newspaper=[[Sportske novosti]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to appear for the club in academy league matches during October. Later that month, it was reported by the local sports daily, ''[[Sportske novosti]]'', that [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s chief scout, Steve Rowley, had arrived in Zagreb to watch him perform in under-17 matches against [[HNK Cibalia|Cibalia]] and [[NK Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="sportske"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/arsenal-dosao-po-matea-kovacica--dinamo-nasao-novo-cudo-od-djeteta---miralema-ramica/899213/ |title=Arsenal došao po Matea Kovačića, Dinamo našao novo čudo od djeteta&amp;nbsp;— Miralema Ramića |date=29 October 2010 |newspaper=Sportske novosti |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovačić eventually had his professional league debut in the [[2010–11 Prva HNL]] away match against [[NK Hrvatski dragovoljac|Hrvatski Dragovoljac]] on 20 November 2010, in which he scored Dinamo's fourth goal in their 6–0 win.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/407740/nogomet-1-hnl/i-kovacic-strijelac-u-dinamovoj-sestici |title=I Kovačić strijelac u Dinamovoj šestici |last=Rupnik |first=Borna |date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Sportnet |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him the youngest goalscorer in the history of the league, at the age of 16 years and 198 days, breaking the record set only a week earlier by [[Dino Špehar]] who had scored for [[NK Osijek]] at the age of 16 years and 278 days on 13 November 2010.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/TcomPrvaHNL/97374/Mateo-Kovacic-najmladi-je-strijelac-Prve-HNL.html |title=Mateo Kovačić najmlađi je strijelac Prve HNL |date=20 November 2010 |publisher=TPortal |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spehar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/407385/nogomet-1-hnl/spehar-spasio-bijelo-plave |title=Špehar spasio bijelo-plave |last=Plavčić |first=Mario |date=13 November 2010 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first senior season with Dinamo Zagreb he managed to appear in 7 matches, making a contribution in winning the league title.

In the [[2011–12 Prva HNL|2011–12]] season, Kovačić rapidly established himself as a first team regular. He played mainly in the position of left midfielder in 4–2–3–1 system. In the beginning of the season, he helped the team reach the Group Stage of the season's [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time in 12 years. Being only 17 years old, he appeared in the starting lineup of Dinamo's first group match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. He finished his first European season with Dinamo by scoring a goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in the last game of the Group Stage in [[Zagreb]] and thus became the second youngest ever scorer in the Champions League. In the domestic league, he was a regular starter, appearing in 25 league matches and scoring five goals in the process. During a league match against [[NK Lučko]], he became the youngest player to wear the captain's armband in Dinamo's history, taking the captaincy from [[Leandro Cufre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kvačić najmlađi kapetan u Dnamovoj povijesti |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/prvaliga/145385/Kovacic-najmladi-kapetan-Dinama-u-povijesti.html#.UQm78x32_Wo |date=27 August 2011 |work=Tportal.hr |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was another successful season for him in domestic competitions as he appeared in 32 domestic league and cup matches during that season, helping Dinamo to win their seventh consecutive league title. He also scored in the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] final against [[NK Osijek]] on [[Maksimir Stadium]]. In December 2011, he was named [[Croatian Footballer of the Year#Hope of the Year|Croatian Football Hope of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovačiću trofej Nada godine: Liga prvaka je bila uživancija |url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacicu-trofej-nada-godine-liga-prvaka-je-bila-uzivancija-248104 |newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]] |date=31 December 2011 |language=Croatian |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of [[2012–13 Prva HNL|2012–13]] season, he suffered a metatarsal bone injury that caused him to miss several games on the club's qualifying road to another Champions League. He returned just in time to play in Dinamo's first Champions League game against [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Kovačić played in all six Dinamo Zagreb's matches in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage]], against Porto, [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. He continued to impress with his mature performances at a young age during the first half of the season. In October 2012, he was nominated for [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy]], an award given by sports journalists to a young player from Europe perceived to have been the most impressive during a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovačić kandidat za prestižnu nagradu "Golden Boy 2012." |url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacic-kandidat-za-prestiznu-nagradu-golden-boy-2012-287471 |newspaper=24sata |date=20 October 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season's winter break, Dinamo's board threw away the speculations about Kovačić leaving the club in the near future by saying they are building a new team around him and another rising star, [[Alen Halilović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovačića i Halilovića nećemo prodati! |url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/dinamo-sporting-nam-se-nije-javio-kovacica-i-halilovica-necemo-prodati/652404.aspx |publisher=index.hr |date=15 December 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 30 January 2013, the media surprisingly revealed Kovačić was sold to Italian [[Serie A]] club Inter Milan.

During his time with Dinamo, Kovačić won two domestic league titles and two Croatian Cup titles, appearing in a total of 73 official matches, including 12 appearances in the UEFA Champions League.

===Inter Milan===
[[File:Mateo Kovacic.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Kovačić with Inter in February 2013.]]
On 31 January 2013, Kovačić agreed to a transfer to Inter Milan. It was revealed the deal was worth €15&amp;nbsp;million in total, with €11&amp;nbsp;million paid immediately and €4&amp;nbsp;million when and if Inter qualifies for the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name="Maglia 10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter, Kovacic da 10, Maglia e calcio senza paura |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/02-02-2013/inter-kovacic-10-video-maglia-calcio-senza-paura-914107775713.shtml |first=Luca |last=Taidelli |newspaper=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]] |date=2 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, Kovačić was given the number 10 shirt, previously worn by [[Wesley Sneijder]].&lt;ref name="Maglia 10"/&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Kovačić made his Inter Milan debut three days later on 3 February, coming on as a half-time substitute in a [[2012–13 Serie A|Serie A]] match against [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Siena-Inter 3-1, Stramaccioni affonda sotto i gol di Sestu e Emeghara |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Siena/03-02-2013/siena-inter-3-1-male-nerazzurri-sestu-emeghara-dominano--914124870634.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=3 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, Kovačić made his European debut before the home crowd at [[San Siro]] in [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] match against [[CFR Cluj]]. He provided the winning assist for [[Rodrigo Palacio]], who made it 2–0 for Inter, impressing the crowd with his performance, and was given standing ovations while being substituted off in the 89th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter-Cluj 2-0: Doppio Palacio, ottimo Kovacic, ma infortunio per Milito |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/14-02-2013/inter-cluj-2-0-doppio-palacio-ottimo-kovacic-ma-infortunio-milito-923391317.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=15 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played full 90 minutes in the 3–0 away win against CFR Cluj as Inter proceeded to the next round of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europa League, Cluj-Inter 0-3: doppietta di Guarin, poi Benassi.

Kovačić made his first domestic league start for Inter in the next round of Serie A in a 1–4 away loss against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. In the round of 16 of the UEFA Europa League, Inter was drawn to play against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. After a 3–0 loss in London, Inter needed a 4–0 win in [[Milan]] to proceed to the next round. The match ended in a 4–1 win for Inter after the match went into extra time, with Kovačić playing as a starter. He impressed with his composure and playmaking ability, once again receiving ovations by the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter-Tottenham 4-1, Cassano da applausi, ma non basta: Spurs ai quarti |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/14-03-2013/europa-league-inter-tottenham-92474067493.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=14 March 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Inter manager [[Andrea Stramaccioni]] hailed his performances on several occasions, describing him as a "star for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inter Milan coach Andrea Stramaccioni hails Mateo Kovacic |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/news/stramaccioni-hails-kovacic_74900.html |last=Mondal |first=Subhankar |date=18 March 2013 |publisher=Sportsmole.co.uk |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, Kovačić was a starter in his first ''[[Derby d'Italia]]'' against Juventus at San Siro. The derby ended in a 1–2 win for Juventus, with Kovačić starting the action that resulted in Rodrigo Palacio's 1–1 equalizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter-Juve.

In May, he was given the "Gentleman Revelation of the Year" award, awarded by Inter fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zanetti fa 13: vince ancora il Gentleman Kovacic e De Sciglio i migliori giovani |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2013/maggio/09/Zanetti_vince_ancora_Gentleman_Kovacic_ga_0_20130509_a099669c-b86c-11e2-bc10-72b41185888f.shtml |first=Francesco |last=Velluzzi |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=9 May 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
Kovačić missed most of the pre-season training with the squad due to series of small injuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovacic out seven days, will miss first friendly match |url=http://fedenerazzurra.com/2013/07/16/kovacic-out-seven-days-will-miss-first-friendly-match/ |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=16 July 2013 |publisher=fedenerazzurra.com |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovacic to miss another 10 days, out against Hamburg and Chelsea |url=http://fedenerazzurra.com/2013/07/27/cds-kovacic-to-miss-another-10-days-out-against-hamburg-and-chelsea/ |newspaper=Corriere dello Sport |date=27 July 2013 |publisher=fedenerazzurra.com |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his comeback just few days before the first official match of the new season, a Coppa Italia match against [[Cittadella]] at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovacic ready to return versus Cittadella |url=http://fedenerazzurra.com/2013/08/13/kovacic-ready-to-return-versus-cittadella/ |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 August 2013 |publisher=fedenerazzurra.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the pre-season interviews, new Inter manager [[Walter Mazzarri]] hinted Kovačić would be given a new role on the pitch, a role similar to [[Marek Hamšík]]'s in Napoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mazzarri: "Non vendo fumo, Kovacic alla Hamsik" |url=http://it.eurosport.yahoo.com/notizie/calcio-in-trentino-mazzarri-non-vendo-fumo-kovacic-110123735.html |publisher=Eurosport |date=11 July 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=31 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224144135/http://it.eurosport.yahoo.com/notizie/calcio-in-trentino-mazzarri-non-vendo-fumo-kovacic-110123735.html |archivedate=24 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of the season, Kovačić played regularly, although he struggled with adjusting to his new tactical role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mazzola: "Kovacic is still not ready" |url=http://fedenerazzurra.com/2013/10/31/mazzola-kovacic-is-still-not-ready/ |work=Novastadio |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=fedenerazzurra.com |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kovačić made his first assist of the season in the match against [[A.S.

===Real Madrid===
[[File:Mateo Kovačić 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kovačić playing for Real Madrid in a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk in 2015.]]
On 16 August 2015, Inter manager [[Roberto Mancini]] confirmed the club was forced to sell Kovačić to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] due to [[UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations|Financial Fair Play]] regulations. Speaking during a press conference after a friendly against Greek club [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], Mancini said, "There are rules that have to be respected.

[[File:Cristiano Ronaldo entrenando.jpg|thumb|left|Kovačić (left) warming up with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Casemiro]] during the 2015–16 season]]
Four days after his presentation, he made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute for [[Isco]] as Real Madrid began the [[La Liga|Liga]] [[2015–16 La Liga|season]] with a goalless draw at promoted [[Sporting de Gijón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sporting spoil Benítez debut |url=http://www.marca.com/en/2015/08/23/en/football/real_madrid/1440360649.html |accessdate=23 August 2015 |work=Marca|location=Spain |date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in an 8–0 home win over [[Malmö FF]] on 8 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000634/match=2015746/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Ronaldo rampant as Madrid put eight past Malmö |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2016, Kovačić received a straight red card in a 2–2 draw at [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] for a foul on [[João Cancelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Emlyn |title=Valencia 2–2 Real Madrid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35155362 |accessdate=3 January 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of his first season with ''Los Blancos'', he made a total of 34 appearances. In the opening months of the season, he was used quite regularly by then Real Madrid manager [[Rafael Benítez]], playing in almost every midfield position there is&amp;nbsp;– sometimes central, sometimes wide, sometimes further forward. However, after [[Zinedine Zidane]] replaced Benítez in early January, Kovačić's appearances became increasingly infrequent. With the Frenchman preferring to use a very defined starting 11 whenever possible instead of the more specific-lineups-for-specific-opponents approach employed by his predecessor, there was little room for Kovačić. He made eight appearances and scored one goal en Real Madrid's route to the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000638/match=2015789/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Spot-on Real Madrid defeat Atlético in final again |date=28 May 2016 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Mateo Kovacic - Croatia vs. Portugal, 10th June 2013.jpg|290px|thumb|Kovačić with the national team in June 2013.]]
Kovačić appeared for the Croatian national team at various youth levels, debuting in May 2008 in an under-14 friendly match against Slovakia.&lt;ref name="hns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/?ln=hr&amp;w=statistike&amp;repka=U&amp;id=156397 |title=Statistike&amp;nbsp;— Nastupi: Mateo Kovačić |publisher=[[Croatian Football Federation]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, he was a regular member of the Croatia under-19 and under-21 teams. In August 2012, Kovačić received his first competitive call-up for the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian senior team]] match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], but did not play because of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Štimac pozvao Kovačića |url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/igor-stimac-za-svicarsku-pozvao-malocu--vukusica--kovacica--sammir-jos-uvijek-na-cekanju/1044377/ |date=30 July 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he received a call up for [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches in March 2013. He made his senior debut in a qualification match against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] on 22 March 2013, playing as a central midfielder alongside Luka Modrić, instead of a regular team starter, [[Ognjen Vukojević]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Štimac: "Odluku o Kovačiću 'prelomio' sam sinoć, odigrao je za desetku" |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/458465/nogomet-reprezentacija/stimac-odluku-o-kovacicu-prelomio-sam-sinoc-odigrao-je-za-desetku/ |publisher=Sportnet |date=22 March 2013 |language=Croatian |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he played against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Liberty Stadium]], coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–2 win. His third match of the campaign came in June, when Croatia faced [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in Zagreb and suffered a frustrating defeat as they were unable to score despite a string of good chances. By the end of the qualifiers, Kovačić made two more competitive appearances for Croatia, as Croatia scraped into the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Second Round|FIFA World Cup play-offs]] having taken only one point from their last four qualifiers. Although he didn't participate in the scoreless first leg of the play-off against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in [[Reykjavík]], Kovačić started the second and decisive leg between the two national teams in Zagreb, making an assist for the team's second goal as they reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] finals 2–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten-man Croatia reached the 2014 World Cup finals |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24907602 |date=19 November 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Mateo Kovacic 21032013 2 Zagrebello roberta f.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Kovačić training with the [[Croatia national football team]] in March 2013]]
Kovačić has been described as a great technician with excellent [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovacic compared with Roberto Baggio |url=http://www.football-italia.net/30222/kovacic-compared-baggio |date=1 February 2013 |publisher=football-italia.net |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrotra"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mehrotra |first=Aakriti |title=Mateo Kovacic: Scout Report&amp;nbsp;— Inter’s creative midfield talent |url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2014/01/23/mateo-kovacic-scout-report/# |work=Outside of the Boot |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stats Show Mateo Kovacic As One Of Europe’s Best Dribblers |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Mateo+Kovacic/articles/Eyd0yinCbnH/Stats+Show+Mateo+Kovacic+One+Europe+Best+Dribblers |publisher=interfanclub.com |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be a versatile midfielder, having played in different midfield positions. He started off as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] at Dinamo Zagreb, but he transformed his game at Inter where he was deployed out wide and also as a central midfielder, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker, while being coached by Andrea Stramaccioni.&lt;ref name="Mehrotra"/&gt; One of his trademarks is dropping deep to receive the ball and then driving forward, often performing his slalom runs.&lt;ref name="Mehrotra"/&gt; Under the coach, Walter Mazzarri, he was often used in a more advanced position.

The Croatia under-17 manager, [[Martin Novoselac]], reportedly said of Kovačić, "I haven't seen a youngster with so much talent since the days of Robert Prosinečki," referring to his fast development and talent.&lt;ref name="zidak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vahid"/&gt; Kovačić revealed that precisely Prosinečki is the player he admired the most while growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovačić otkrio Talijanima koga je 'snimao' |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/nogomet/242330/Kovacic-otkrio-Talijanima-koga-je-volio-gledati.html |publisher=Tportal.hr |date=8 February 2013 |language=Croatian |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His compatriot, [[Zvonimir Boban]], who played for [[A.C.

'''Olivier Jonathan Giroud''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔlivje ʒiʁu}}; born 30 September 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

He began his career at [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] in [[Ligue 2]] before joining [[Tours FC|Tours]] in 2008. In his [[2009–10 Ligue 2|second season]] at Tours, he was the division's top scorer with 21 goals, earning him a move to top-flight side [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. Giroud was again the top scorer with 21 goals in the [[2011–12 Ligue 1|2011–12 season]], giving the club their first ever [[Ligue 1]] title before moving to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Giroud won the [[FA Cup]] with Arsenal in [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]] and [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]], and totalled 105 goals in 253 games for the club. In January 2018, he transferred to Chelsea on an 18-month contract.

Giroud made his full international debut for France in 2011. He has earned over 80 caps, and was part of the teams which reached the quarter-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] in which he received the [[UEFA Euro 2016#Awards|Bronze Boot]] as joint second-highest goalscorer, and won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early career==
Giroud was born in [[Chambéry]], France in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]], and was raised in the nearby village of [[Froges]], close to [[Grenoble]].&lt;ref name="giroud_career"&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview Olivier Giroud avant RC Strasbourg – Tours FC |url=http://toursfc.over-blog.com/article-interview-olivier-giroud-avant-rc-strasbourg-tours-fc-38281708.html|work=[[Tours FC]] | date= 27 October 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroud is of Italian descent through both of his grandmothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rfgenealogie.com/s-informer/infos/celebrites/aux-origines-de-payet-giroud-et-griezmann|title=Aux origines de Payet, Giroud et Griezmann|first=eZ|last=Systems|website=La revue française de Généalogie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofoot.com/giroud-la-marseillaise-et-sa-mamie-223738.html|title=Giroud, la Marseillaise et sa mamie|website=''SOFOOT.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroud began his football career playing for his hometown club, Olympique Club de Froges. He spent six years training at the club before joining professional club [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="giroud_career"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Grenoble===
Giroud spent five years developing in Grenoble's youth academy before signing his first professional contract at the age of 21. He later admitted that signing his first contract was an important part in his development as a player, stating "It took me signing my first professional contract to become aware of my abilities. If you [a club] trusted me, it was because I must have had some qualities."&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"&gt;{{cite news |title=Olivier Giroud, buteur né |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2011/10/30/ligue-1-olivier-giroud-buteur-ne_1595293_3242.html|work=Le Monde | date= 30 October 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the [[2005–06 Ligue 2|2005–06 season]], he was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the [[Championnat de France amateur 2]], the fifth level of [[Football in France|French football]]. Giroud quickly became an important player in the team scoring 15 goals in 15 matches.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; His performances over seven months with the reserve team resulted in the player being called up to the senior team in March 2006 by manager [[Thierry Goudet]]. Giroud made his professional debut on 27 March appearing as a late-match substitute in a 1–1 draw with [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] in [[Ligue 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gueugnon v. Grenoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/50374|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a part of the senior team for the rest of the campaign making five more substitute appearances.

Giroud was promoted to the senior team permanently for the [[2006–07 Ligue 2|2006–07]] season by new manager Payton Pouliquen and Nicola Malgeri and was assigned the number 22 shirt. After appearing as a substitute in the team's first league match of the campaign, he made his first professional start in a 2–1 defeat away to [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]] playing the entire match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Niort v. Grneoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/50922|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2007, Giroud scored his first professional goal netting the [[injury time]] winner against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grenoble v. Le Havre Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/51254|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the goal as "a fantastic memory. I could not dream better for a first pro goal". A month later, Giroud made his third start of the campaign against Gueugnon. In the match, which ended 0–0, Giroud incurred his first professional [[Penalty card|red card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gueugnon v. Grenoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/51172|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the campaign with 18 total appearances and two goals as Grenoble finished in fifth place.

====Loan to Istres====
In an attempt to earn some playing time, Giroud spent the [[2007–08 Championnat National|2007–08 season]] on loan at [[FC Istres|Istres]] in the [[Championnat National]], the third level of football in France.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Under the tutelage of manager [[Frédéric Arpinon]], he continued his development as a striker and, in his second match with the club, scored his first goal in a 2–1 win over [[Stade Lavallois|Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laval v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-laval-istres-8958.html|work=Foot-National | date=11 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Giroud scored goals in back-to-back matches against [[Vannes OC|Vannes]] and [[US Créteil-Lusitanos|Créteil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Istres v. VannesMatch Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-istres-vannes-9052.html|work=Foot-National | date=25 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Créteil v.

Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-arles-avignon-istres-9292.html|work=Foot-National | date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fortnight later, Giroud converted two goals again, this time in a 3–2 win over [[Pau FC|Pau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pau v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-pau-istres-8978.html|work=Foot-National | date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After going through the months of November and December without scoring a league goal, Giroud returned to form in January scoring goals in a 3–2 defeat to Vannes and a 2–0 win over [[AS Beauvais Oise|Beauvais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vannes v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-vannes-istres-9053.html|work=Foot-National | date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beauvais v.

Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-paris-fc-istres-9151.html|work=Foot-National | date=5 April 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Martigues v.

After a successful loan stint, Giroud returned to Grenoble with hopes of receiving some significant playing time as the club was now playing in [[Ligue 1]]. However, club manager [[Mehmed Baždarević]], who was hired while Giroud was on his loan stint at Istres, deemed the player surplus to requirements and, subsequently, listed him for transfer. According to reports, Baždarević had declared that Giroud "did not have the level to play among the elite".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; In 2011, Giroud reevaluated his departure from Grenoble stating "I am neither resentful nor vengeful. I am just disappointed with what happened to Grenoble when there was great potential".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt;

===Tours===
[[File:Olivier giroud.jpg|thumb|upright|Giroud playing for Tours in 2010]]
On 28 May 2008, it was reported that Giroud had agreed to a three-year deal with Ligue 2 club [[Tours FC|Tours]]. The striker was lured to the club by sporting director Max Marty who had previously served as the chief executive officer of Grenoble, Giroud's former club.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Giroud was also fond of Tours' manager [[Daniel Sanchez (French footballer)|Daniel Sanchez]] stating "It's always a plus to have a former striker as a coach. His advice to me really helped a lot. With him, I progressed in my positioning and also in front of goal".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Giroud was given the number 12 shirt and, due to injury, made his club debut on 3 September 2008 in a 2–1 defeat to [[US Boulogne|Boulogne]] in the [[2008–09 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Boulogne Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/52984|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut a week later playing the entire match in a 1–0 win over [[Nîmes Olympique|Nîmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nîmes v. Tours Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52658|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Giroud scored his first goal for the club converting the opener in a league match against [[RC Lens|Lens]]. In the second half, he scored another goal to cap a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Lens Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52697|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Giroud scored his third goal for the club in a victory over [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v.

In the [[2008–09 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], Giroud scored five goals in two matches.

'''Andreas Bødtker Christensen ''' ({{IPA-da|ˈkʁɛsdn̩sn̩|pron}}; born 10 April 1996) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]].

He began his career at [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] and joined Chelsea at the age of 15 in February 2012, making his professional debut in October 2014. From 2015 to 2017 he was loaned to [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], where he made 82 appearances and scored 7 goals. Christensen made his full international debut for Denmark in June 2015, and represented the nation at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
====Early career====
[[File:Andreas Christensen.jpg|thumb|upright|Christensen playing for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2013]]

The son of former [[Brøndby IF]] goalkeeper Sten Christensen, he began his career with Brøndby IF. He spent eight years there, attracting the interest of Europe's elite clubs including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. On 7 February 2012, Christensen signed for Chelsea on a free transfer, near the end of [[André Villas-Boas]]' tenure as the club's manager. Upon joining the [[London]] side, Christensen said: "I have chosen Chelsea because they play the kind of football I like.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/02/07/2892141/chelsea-complete-signing-of-15-year-old-brondby-defender-andreas-|title=Chelsea complete signing of 15-year-old Brondby defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer|date=7 February 2012|website=Goal.com|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen was first included in a Chelsea senior squad for their last game of the [[2012–13 Chelsea F.C. season|2012–13 season]] on 19 May 2013, but did not feature in the match, which ended a 2–1 home win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in [[Rafael Benítez]]'s last match as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Owen|title=Chelsea 2–1 Everton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499152|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-season tour of the United States before the [[2013–14 Chelsea F.C. season|2013–14 season]], he was part of the senior team squad and signed a professional contract thereafter.&lt;ref name=chelsea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/andreas-christensen.html |title=Christensen Chelsea Profile |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815081559/http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/andreas-christensen.html |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
He made his professional debut on 28 October 2014, playing the full 90 minutes at right back as Chelsea won 2–1 away to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the fourth round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Shrewsbury 1–2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29699744|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen did not play again until 24 January 2015, when he was utilized in the same position for Chelsea's 2–4 home defeat to [[EFL League One|League One]] team [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emons|first1=Michael|title=Chelsea 2–4 Bradford|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30860394|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christensen played no further part in the campaign, Chelsea won the League Cup with a 2–0 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in [[2015 Football League Cup Final|the final]]. When asked who was [[man of the match]] for the final, manager [[José Mourinho]] said "Man of the match was Andreas Christensen who played well against Shrewsbury. There are more than [[John Terry]] (the official Man of the match for the final) because we are a team. I am proud of the guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matic's kit, phone calls, but no party: Chelsea's cup celebrations|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31687889|accessdate=2 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2015, Christensen played for Chelsea U19 in the final of the 2014–15 [[UEFA Youth League]] against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] in Switzerland and although he scored an own goal to cancel out [[Izzy Brown]]'s opener in the first-half, Chelsea still ended with a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000561/match=2016409/postmatch/report/index.html#brown+inspires+chelsea+youth+league+glory&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 24 May, replacing [[John Obi Mikel]] with 12 minutes remaining in a 3–1 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winton|first1=Richard|title=Chelsea 3–1 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32770811|accessdate=24 May 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christensen only made one league appearances out of the whole season, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica medal from his club for his contributions this season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/chelsea/story/2450893/jose-mourinho-every-chelsea-player-to-get-prem-medal |title=Every Chelsea player to get a Premier League medal says Jose Mourinho |publisher=ESPN |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Borussia Mönchengladbach====
On 10 July 2015, Christensen joined [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] on a two-year [[loan (sports)|loan]] deal from Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German loan for Christensen|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/07/german-loan-for-christensen.html|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borussia.de/english/season/news/borussia-news/news-detailansicht.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=14343&amp;cHash=fdce92ddca7a52a6d25fe4c765c9add5
|title=Borussia bring in Chelsea's Andreas Christensen on loan|publisher=Borussia Mönchengladbach|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 10 August  against [[FC St. Pauli]] in the first round of the [[2015–16 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]], winning 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=St. Pauli vs. Borussia M'gladbach 1 – 4|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/10/germany/dfb-pokal/fc-st-pauli-von-1910-ev/borussia-monchengladbach/2038932/|website=Soccerway|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Christensen made his [[Bundesliga]] debut in a 4–0 loss at [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Borussia Dortmund vs. Borussia M'gladbach 4 – 0

After an impressive debut season, Christensen was voted the team's Player of the Season, ahead of [[Granit Xhaka]], the  team [[captain (association football)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/13/chelsea-prodigy-andreas-christensen-wins-borussia-monchegladbach-player-of-the-year-ahead-of-arsenals-granit-xhaka-5942365/|title=Chelsea prodigy Andreas Christensen wins Borussia Monchegladbach player of the year ahead of Arsenal's Granit Xhaka|website=Metro|publisher=Metro|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of his first season, Monchegladbach made multiple attempts to move his loan move into a permanent during the [[List of English football transfers summer 2016|2016 summer]], although it was reported Chelsea rejected the £14.25&amp;nbsp;million bid from the German side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10506225/chelsea-reject-borussia-monchengladbach-bid-for-andreas-christensen-sky-sources |title=Chelsea reject Borussia Monchengladbach bid for Andreas Christensen – Sky sources |date=19 July 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League]], Christensen scored the final goal of a 4–2 win away to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in the second leg of the last 32 to assure a 4–3 aggregate win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiorentina 2–4 Borussia Mönchengladbach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39068922|accessdate=29 December 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on target again in the next round against neighbours [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]], who won on away goals after a 3–3 aggregate draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Borussia Monchengladbach 2 Schalke 2 (3-3 agg, Schalke win on away goals): Bentaleb penalty sends visitors through|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/borussia-monchengladbach-2-schalke-2-3-3-agg-schalke-win-away-goals-bentaleb-penalty-sends|accessdate=29 December 2017|website=FourFourTwo|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Chelsea====
On 12 August 2017, Christensen made his first appearance for Chelsea following his two-year loan spell in Germany, coming off the bench following captain [[Gary Cahill]] being sent off, in Chelsea's 3–2 opening day home defeat against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40835426|title=Chelsea 2–3 Burnley|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, he made his first Premier League start in a 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40914668|title=Tottenham Hotspur 1–2 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2018, Christensen signed a new four-and-half-year deal with Chelsea running until 2022, after establishing himself in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christensen commits |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2018/01/christensen-commits-.html |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=9 January 2018 |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen made 40 appearances for the Blues in 2017–18, including three in the victorious [[FA Cup]] campaign. However, a back injury meant he was not involved in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Revealed: Why Andreas Christensen was not in Chelsea's squad for FA Cup victory over Man United |url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/christensen-chelsea-fa-cup-final-14680790 |publisher=football.london |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the season's finish, he was awarded the club's [[Chelsea Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christensen: Great to play on the big stage |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2018/05/christensen--great-to-play-on-the-big-stage.html |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New manager [[Maurizio Sarri]] preferred to pair [[David Luiz]] and [[Antonio Rüdiger]] in central defence, and by February 2019 Christensen had made 15 appearances, only two of which in the league. However, he ruled out wanting to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burton |first1=Chris |title=Christensen had ‘doubts’ but never considered leaving Chelsea |url=https://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/christensen-had-doubts-but-never-considered-leaving-chelsea/1onure75w5lpv1lfg1tlqzis4y |accessdate=26 February 2019 |publisher=Goal.com |date=18 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 8 June 2015, Christensen made his senior international debut for [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in a 2–1 home friendly win against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] at the [[Viborg Stadium]], as a 69th-minute substitute for [[Pierre-Emile Højbjerg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Allan|title=Pierre-Emile er vores panzerwagen!|trans-title=Pierre-Emile is our tank!|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/kommentarer/allanolsen/pierre-emile-er-vores-panzerwagen/5598839|accessdate=8 June 2015|newspaper=Ekstra Bladet|location=Copenhagn|date=8 June 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 2016, Christensen made his first Denmark start in a 2–1 victory over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], playing the full 90 minutes of the friendly at the [[MCH Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Denmark vs. Iceland (2 : 1) |url=https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/denmark-vs-iceland-lineup-24-473799?period=FullTime |publisher=OneFootball |date=25 March 2016 |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406031642/https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/denmark-vs-iceland-lineup-24-473799?period=FullTime |archive-date=6 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen played six matches in Denmark's successful [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. On 14 November 2017 he scored his first international goal to equalise in a 5–1 win over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in the second leg of the play-off.&lt;ref name=ireland/&gt; Manager [[Age Hareide]] called him up for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final]] tournament in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Nicklas Bendtner left out of Denmark squad because of injury |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44350548 |accessdate=26 February 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He partnered [[Simon Kjær]] in central defence, having been able to play in that position due to [[Andreas Bjelland]]'s absence through injury, but played in defensive midfield in the final group game against [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Sam |title=Andreas Christensen gives next Chelsea manager food for thought with commanding midfield display |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/06/26/andreas-christensen-gives-next-chelsea-manager-food-thought/ |accessdate=26 February 2019 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 16 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], he remained in midfield to combat the opponents' strength in that sector, but made an error that allowed [[Mario Mandžukić]] to equalise as the Croats went on to win on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Jack |title=Croatia vs Denmark, World Cup 2018: Andreas Christensen falls flat on his face in midfield audition – scouting report |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/croatia-vs-denmark-world-cup-2018-andreas-christensen-chelsea-analysis-manager-maurizio-sarri-a8425921.html |accessdate=26 February 2019 |work=The Independent |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Christensen is a [[centre back]]. In 2018, Chelsea manager [[Antonio Conte]] said the Dane had displayed "great maturity" adding that he has "a lot of trust in Christensen. This player is a player for the present for Chelsea, and for Chelsea's future for 10 or 12 years. He can also become the captain of this team in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea boss Antonio Conte backs Andreas Christensen to become club captain|first=Vaishali|last=Bhardwaj|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=24 February 2018|newspaper=London Evening Standard|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/antonio-conte-backs-andreas-christensen-to-become-chelsea-captain-a3774486.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''César Azpilicueta Tanco''' ({{IPA-es|ˈθesaɾ aθpiliˈkweta ˈtaŋko}}; born 28 August 1989) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]] primarily as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full back]] but also as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]].

A youth product of [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], he spent three seasons in [[La Liga]] before switching to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], winning four major honours with the French club. In the summer of 2012, he moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning the [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League]] in his first season and a domestic [[Double (association football)|double]] [[2014–15 Chelsea F.C. season|two years later]].

Azpilicueta earned 55 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Spain national youth football team|Spain at youth level]] in all age groups, and represented the [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21s]] in two [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship|European Championships]], [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|winning the 2011 edition]]. He made his first appearance with [[Spain national football team|the full side]] in 2013, and was selected for two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] as well as [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Osasuna===
Azpilicueta was born in [[Pamplona]], [[Navarre]]. A [[CA Osasuna Juvenil|product]] of hometown club [[CA Osasuna]]'s youth system, he made his [[La Liga]] debut on 8 April 2007 in a 0–2 away loss against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], while still registered with [[CA Osasuna B|the reserve team]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/report/_/id/204057?cc=5739|title=Real Madrid 2–0 Osasuna|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=8 April 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he started his career as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] then switched to [[midfielder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trolacas.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/cesar-azpilicueta-intentad-atacar-por-la-otra-banda/|title=César Azpilicueta, intentad atacar por la otra banda|trans-title=César Azpilicueta, try the other wing|publisher=El Blog de los Trolacas|language=es|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, throughout both his club and international career (senior and youth), appeared in several positions including [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]] and [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ideal.es/granada/deportes/futbol/seleccion-espanola/201411/12/azpilicueta-nuevo-seguro-bosque-20141112195750-rc.html|title=Azpilicueta, el nuevo 'seguro' de Del Bosque|trans-title=Azpilicueta, Del Bosque's new 'insurance'|newspaper=[[Ideal (newspaper)|Ideal]]|language=es|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08]], due to injuries in the main squad, Azpilicueta established himself as a first-team regular at the age of just 18, albeit as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]]. He went on to retain this position for [[2008–09 La Liga|the following season]], appearing in all but two league games.

===Marseille===
[[File:César Azpilicueta 5401.jpg|thumb|left|Azpilicueta playing for Marseille in the [[2010–11 Olympique de Marseille season|2010–11 season]].]]
On 21 June 2010, [[France|French]] club [[Olympique de Marseille]] confirmed an agreement had been reached with Osasuna for the transfer of Azpilicueta, in a four-year contract for [[Euro|€]]7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101005/Actualites/47377/Accord_de_principe_pour_le_transfert_de_Cesar_Azpilicueta|title=Accord de principe pour le transfert de César Azpilicueta|trans-title=Deal arranged for transfer of Azpilicueta|publisher=Olympique Marseille|language=fr|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.les-transferts.com/ligue-1/lom-regle-le-probleme-a-droite.html|title=OM: Azpilicueta et Modesto arrivent!|trans-title=OM: Azpilicueta and Modesto arrive!|publisher=Les Transferts|language=fr|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the Navarrese confirmed the agreement, with the transfer fee possibly rising to as much as €9.5&amp;nbsp;million depending on appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercato365.com/infos-clubs/marseille/article_429807_OM-Azpi-pour-95-millions-d-euros-.shtml|title=Azpi pour 9.5&amp;nbsp;million euros?|trans-title=Azpi for 9.5&amp;nbsp;million euros?|publisher=Mercato 365|language=fr|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut he scored the match's only goal in a [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|group stage home match]] against [[FC Spartak Moscow]], albeit in [[Own goal|his own net]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000118/match=2002819/index.html|title=Spartak sucker punch downs Marseille|publisher=UEFA|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2010, in the early minutes of a 4–0 home win against [[Montpellier HSC]] – which meant Marseille [[2010–11 Ligue 1|climbed to the top of the league]] – Azpilicueta ruptured the [[anterior cruciate ligament]]s in his left knee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://int.soccerway.com/news/2010/November/28/marseille-go-top-but-pay-high-price/ Marseille go top but pay high price] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129014337/http://www.soccerway.com/news/2010/November/28/marseille-go-top-but-pay-high-price/|date=29 November 2010}}; Soccerway, 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was sidelined for six months.

In August 2012, amid speculation of clubs showing interest in Azpilicueta, including [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], Marseille confirmed that he could leave, saying, "If Chelsea makes a fair offer for Azpi [Azpilicueta], we will let him leave."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7988728/Marseille-confirm-need-to-sell Marseille confirm need to sell]; [[Sky Sports]], 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his loyalty to Marseille, the player said he was willing to leave if his "departure can help Marseille's finances".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8007076/Azpilicueta-open-to-Blues-move Azpilicueta open to Blues move]; Sky Sports, 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:César Azpilicueta Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Azpilicueta in action against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 2013]]
On 24 August 2012, Chelsea completed the signing of Azpilicueta for an undisclosed fee, reported as [[Pound sterling|£]]7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2898781|title=Azpilicueta signs|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830171700/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2898781|archivedate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/8014372/Azpilicueta-joins-Chelsea|title=Azpilicueta joins Chelsea|publisher=Sky Sports|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to teammate and countryman [[Juan Mata]], "He is a strong running right-back who has pace as well, so I think he is already a complete player."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2899038/title/di-matteo%3A-cesar-offers-options|title=Di Matteo: Cesar offers options|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830171757/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2899038/title/di-matteo:-cesar-offers-options|archivedate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his surname being difficult for some speakers of English to pronounce, club fans gave him the [[Mononymous person|mononymous]] nickname "Dave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cesar-dave-azpilicueta-shows-the-attitude-to-delight-chelsea-manager-jose-mourinho-9759011.html|title=Cesar 'Dave' Azpilicueta shows the attitude to delight Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Glenn|last=Moore|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azpilicueta made his debut on 25 September 2012, starting in a 6–0 home win against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19632463|title=Chelsea 6–0 Wolves|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 September 2012|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first Premier League game the following week, coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Branislav Ivanović]] in a 4–1 success over [[Norwich City F.C|Norwich City]], also at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19776324|title=Chelsea put their off-field troubles aside as they emphatically beat struggling Norwich to continue to set the Premier League pace.|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Mandeep|last=Sanghera|date=6 October 2012|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2012, Azpilicueta made his first league start, appearing against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in a 1–1 away draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/report?gameId=345755|title=Swansea City 1–1 Chelsea|publisher=ESPN FC|date=3 November 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 48 official contests in [[2012–13 Premier League|his first year]] with the [[Rafael Benítez]]-led side, including eight in the Blues' [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|victorious campaign]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]] against [[S.L. Benfica]] his 67th-minute handball led to [[Óscar Cardozo]] equalising through a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], in an eventual 2–1 win in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000361/match=2010095/postmatch/report/index.html#ivanovic+heads+chelsea+europa+league+glory|title=Ivanović heads Chelsea to Europa League glory|publisher=UEFA|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz made his full international debut for Brazil in 2010 and has since earned over 50 caps for his country.

==Club career==

===Vitória===
Born in [[Diadema, São Paulo]], to Ladislao and Regina Marinho, David Luiz arrived at [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]-based club [[Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória]] after being released by [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvabcd.com.br/noticias/1058/david-luiz-e-o-representante-de-diadema-na-selecao-brasileira|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110706154639/http://www.tvabcd.com.br/noticias/1058/david-luiz-e-o-representante-de-diadema-na-selecao-brasileira|archivedate=6 July 2011|title=David Luiz é o representante de Diadema na Seleção Brasileira|trans-title=David Luiz represents Diadema in Brazil national team|publisher=Tvabcd|language=pt|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started playing as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], almost leaving the club for his poor performances in that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=pt|url=http://br.esporteinterativo.yahoo.com/noticias/spt---pensei-em-dispensar-volante-david-luiz---revela-treinador-da-base-do-vit%C3%B3ria--veja--223832836.html|title="Pensei em dispensar David Luiz", revela coordenador da base do Vitória.

Look!|publisher=[[Esporte Interativo]]|website=[[Yahoo!]]|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was soon moved to central defender and adapted well.&lt;ref name=gterra&gt;{{cite news|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI4587001-EI6583,00-Zagueiro+convocado+por+Mano+e+avaliado+em+R+milhoes.html|author=Eliano Jorge|title=Zagueiro convocado por Mano é avaliado em R$ 114,5 milhões|trans-title=Stopper selected by Mano is worth R$ 114,5 millions|publisher=Gterra|language=pt|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz made his official debut for Vitória in 2006, excelling in a 2–2 draw against [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz]] for [[2006 Copa do Brasil|that season]]'s [[Copa do Brasil]].&lt;ref name=gterra/&gt; At the worst situation of its history, in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|third division]], the club eventually [[2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|promoted]] to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|second level]] after finishing in second position, with the player appearing in eight of the club's last decisive nine games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campeoesdofutebol.com.br/clas_seriec_2006.html|title=Campeonato Brasileiro Série C – 2006|publisher=Campeoes do Futebol|language=pt|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring his only league goal on 3 September 2006 in a 2–0 home win against [[Clube Atlético do Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitória|publisher=Futebol 80|language=pt|url=http://www.futebol80.com.br/links/times/vitoria/vitoriajg.htm|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benfica===
On 30 January 2007, David Luiz joined Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] as a replacement for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]-bound [[Ricardo Rocha (footballer, born 1978)|Ricardo Rocha]], on loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=503237.html Benfica replace Ricardo Rocha]; UEFA, 1 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He made a somewhat tumultuous debut for the club in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] match against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] at the [[Parc des Princes]], partnering compatriot [[Anderson Cléber Beraldo|Anderson]] in the centre of defence, replacing the injured [[Luisão]]. Benfica lost the match 2–1, but managed [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|to progress to the next round]] after winning 4–3 on aggregate.

On 12 March 2007, he played his first [[Primeira Liga|league]] match for Benfica, against [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/games/?game=4858|title=Tactical Formation|publisher=Football-Lineups|accessdate=14 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112156/http://www.football-lineups.com/games/?game=4858|archivedate=11 October 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|the season]], David Luiz signed a five-year deal with the club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=544985.html David Luiz banking on Benfica]; UEFA, 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the season, following ten league appearances, he joined permanently for [[Euro|€]]1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt; Before the ensuing campaign, he scored his first goal for the club in the [[Guadiana Trophy]] friendly tournament, against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. David Luiz only managed eight appearances in the [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|league]] due to injury, however, as Benfica finished fourth.

On 11 January 2009, David Luiz netted his first official goal for Benfica, the game's only in a home success against [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. He played most of [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|the campaign]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]], at the expense of [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese international]] [[Jorge Ribeiro]].

However, it was on the [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|2009–10 season]], when new manager [[Jorge Jesus]] arrived to Benfica, that David Luiz became a club symbol and vice-captain. He was ever-present, appearing in 49 official matches (three goals, 4,206 minutes), as Benfica won the league after a five-year wait. In [[2009–10 Taça da Liga|the season]]'s [[Taça da Liga]], in a 1–4 away win against Sporting CP, he opened the score in the eighth minute, with Benfica also eventually winning the competition. David Luiz won the [[LPFP Primeira Liga Player of the Year|Portuguese Liga Player of the Year]] that same season, with 38% of the vote while the runner-up, his teammate [[Ángel Di María]], received 8%.&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt;

On 30 September 2009, Benfica sold 25% of David Luiz's economic rights on any future transfer to a [[Third-party ownership in association football|third-party owner]], [[Benfica Stars Fund]], along with other teammates. He was tagged at €18&amp;nbsp;million, with the fund paying €4.5&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR25467.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=CMVM|language=pt|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his contract was also renewed in October, with a release clause of €50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR25595.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=CMVM|language=pt|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=9 October 2017|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to making his debut for Brazil, the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] had considered calling him up to [[Portugal national football team|their own national team]].&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt;

David Luiz was present in every squad during the management of Menezes and was called up to the [[2011 Copa América squads#Brazil|squad]] for the [[Copa América]] in [[2011 Copa América|2011]], but did not make a single appearance at the tournament due to injury.&lt;ref name="KNEE"/&gt; In a friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in October of that year, he scored an [[own goal]], but the ''Seleção'' eventually won it 2–1.

On 7 September 2012, David Luiz [[Captain (association football)|captained]] Brazil for the first time, appearing in a 1–0 win against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/br/news/3838/sele%C3%A7%C3%A3o-brasileira/2012/09/07/3360797/david-luiz-ser%C3%A1-o-capit%C3%A3o-da-sele%C3%A7%C3%A3o-brasileira-contra-a|title=David Luiz será o capitão da Seleção Brasileira contra a África do Sul|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=9 October 2017|website=Goal.com|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup squads#Brazil|the squad]] for the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]], which was hosted in his native Brazil.

David Luiz was a member of Brazil's [[2015 Copa América squads#Brazil|squad]] for the [[2015 Copa América]] in Chile. He partnered [[Miranda (footballer)|Miranda]] in central defence for the team's first two [[2015 Copa América Group C|group matches]], before being dropped for Thiago Silva, as Brazil were knocked out by [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[2015 Copa América knockout stage#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/copa-america/83/blog/post/2500668/brazil-learning-to-play-without-neymar-is-a-sign-of-progress|title=Brazil and Dunga learning to play without Neymar is a sign of progress|date=21 June 2015|work=ESPN|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Brazil vs Germany, in Belo Horizonte 12.jpg|thumb|right|David Luiz [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing his country in the [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7–1]] defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]]]

Although primarily a [[centre back]], David Luiz can also be deployed as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], and has drawn praise for his physical strength, work-rate, technique, and range of distribution as a defender, as well as his personality, composure in possession, and confidence on the ball, which enables him to play the ball out from the back or launch an attack with long balls after winning back possession. A powerful striker of the ball from distance, Luiz has also been known to take and score from long-range free kicks. Although in the past he has been criticised in the media for his inconsistent defensive performances, and for being reckless in his challenges, as well as prone to errors or lapses in concentration, during the 2016–17 season, he showed notable improvements upon his return to Chelsea, when the club's new manager [[Antonio Conte]] decided to deploy him as a [[Sweeper (association football)|ball-playing centre back]] in a three-man back-line in the team's [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]]. Luiz excelled in the new role, while Conte praised the defender for working to improve his composure and concentration, and singled out Luiz as being "crucial" to the team's success, also labelling him as one of the best defenders in the world.&lt;ref name=capture/&gt;&lt;ref name=mistakes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil 2-1 Colombia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conte’s brilliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/may/13/antonio-conte-chelsea-champions-manager|title=Antonio Conte’s brilliance has turned Chelsea’s pop-up team into champions|work=The Guardian|author=Barney Ronay|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/3032491/pochettino-copies-conte-and-tottenham-thwart-costa-as-chelsea-run-ends|title=Pochettino copies Conte, Tottenham thwart Costa to deny Chelsea|publisher=ESPN|author=Thore Haugstad|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conte's tactical shift cures Chelsea"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/10/24/chelseas-man-utd-win-inspired-by-formation-desire-to-put-one-ove/|title=Antonio Conte's tactical shift cures Chelsea from back to front|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 October 2016|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2015-2016/chelsea-laying-claim-to-barcelona-legacy-with-conte-s-masterstroke_sto5942103/story.shtml|title=Chelsea laying claim to Barcelona legacy with Conte's masterstroke|publisher=Eurosport|author=Dan Levene|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/antonio-conte-david-luiz-chelsea-great-challenge-back-three-vs-manchester-united-a7684921.html|title=Antonio Conte saw reinventing David Luiz and overcoming Chelsea criticism as 'great challenge'|publisher=The Independent|author1=Miguel Delaney|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/chelsea/story/3104925/chelsea-never-doubted-david-luizs-quality-as-top-defender-antonio-conte|title=Chelsea never doubted David Luiz's quality as top defender – Antonio Conte|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Liam Twomey|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2011/03/is_luiz_the_new_lucio.html|title=Is Luiz the new Lucio?|department=BBC Sport|author1=Tim Vickery|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Green Norway-England 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Green playing for England in 2012]]

Green was named in England's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Players List |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/22/85/78/fwc_2010_squadlists.pdf |publisher=FIFA |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Fabio Capello opted not to name his first choice goalkeeper until the day of England's opening match, against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on 12 June, at which point he selected Green to start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Capello defends goalkeeper delay |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/capello-defends-goalkeeper-delay |publisher=Professional Footballers' Association |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After England went into a 1–0 lead, Green failed to save a long-range shot from USA midfielder [[Clint Dempsey]] in the 40th minute. The incident saw the ball bounce on and off Green's gloves and go over the goal line. This is known as his World Cup mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=McNulty, Phil |title=England 1–1 USA |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_05 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in a 1–1 draw. Following this error and an unconvincing final training session on 17 June, Green was dropped. He was replaced by David James who played in England's next match, a 0–0 draw against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2010: David James will play against Algeria |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8747673.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England 0–0 Algeria|author=McNulty, Phil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_23|publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not appear again in the World Cup and was omitted from the first England squad named after the tournament for a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Chelsea===
On 1 July 2017, Ampadu signed a contract with [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. The two clubs had entered negotiations over a compensation fee for the player in an attempt to reach a fee that both found acceptable for the then 16-year-old. Yet, in November 2017, [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] chairman Julian Tagg said that, whilst there was still a positive relationship between the two clubs, there was also a "massive disparity" in both clubs' valuation of the player. It was set to go to a tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.devonlive.com/sport/football/football-news/what-know-far-chelsea-exeter-781193|title=What we know so far about the Ethan Ampadu tribunal|last=Byrom|first=David|date=15 November 2017|work=devonlive|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2017, Ampadu made his debut for Chelsea in an EFL Cup third round match against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], coming on in the 55th minute for [[Cesc Fàbregas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41249727|title=Chelsea 5–1 Nottingham Forest|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so made him the first player born in the 2000s to play for the Chelsea senior team. At 17 years and six days old, he also became the youngest player to debut for the club in over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/ethan-ampadu-becomes-youngest-chelsea-player-in-over-a/bc21v7w4akx81wegeigdlwkge |title=Ethan Ampadu becomes youngest Chelsea player in over a decade |date=20 September 2017 |publisher=Goal}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2017, he made his Premier League debut for Chelsea, coming on as a substitute against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in the 80th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42232614|title=Huddersfield Town 1–3 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 December 2017|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ampadu plays internationally for the [[Wales national football team]]. He qualifies for Wales through his Welsh mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/who-ethan-ampadu-wales-face-11729005 Ampadu Welsh qualified]&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously also eligible to represent England, Republic of Ireland and Ghana.&lt;ref name="walesonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-fc-target-ethan-11154499|title=Why Man Utd target Ethan Ampadu chose Wales over England|first=Gareth|last=Rogers|date=7 April 2016|work=WalesOnline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2017, at the age of 16, Ampadu was called into the [[Wales national football team|senior Wales squad]] ahead of their World Cup qualifier with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethan Ampadu: Exeter City youngster included in Wales squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40041499|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up again on 1 November for friendlies against [[France national football team|France]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byrom|first1=David|title=Chelsea starlet Ethan Ampadu included in Wales squad for November friendlies|url=http://www.devonlive.com/sport/football/football-news/chelsea-starlet-ethan-ampadu-included-712273|accessdate=11 November 2017|publisher=Devon Live|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut on 10 November at the [[Stade de France]], coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for [[Joe Ledley]] in a 2–0 defeat to the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41854507 |title=France 2–0 Wales |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2013, English [[Premier League]] club Chelsea announced that they had reached an agreement with Vitesse for the transfer of Van Ginkel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3227800/title/agreement-reached-for-transfer-of-van-ginkel |title=AGREEMENT REACHED FOR TRANSFER OF VAN GINKEL |publisher=Chelsea |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055057/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3227800/title/agreement-reached-for-transfer-of-van-ginkel |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fee reported to be in the region of £8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23148099 |title= Chelsea set to complete deal for Marco van Ginkel |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, Chelsea confirmed that they had completed the signing of Van Ginkel, with the Dutch international midfielder signing a five-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229499/title/van-ginkel-signs |title=VAN GINKEL SIGNS |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708070811/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229499/title/van-ginkel-signs |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the official Chelsea website upon his signing with the club, Van Ginkel described himself as "a box-to-box player" who "covers a lot of metres and can score a goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229543/title/first-words-marco-van-ginkel |title=First Words: Marco van Ginkel |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708070812/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229543/title/first-words-marco-van-ginkel |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
On the opening day of the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season, Van Ginkel made his competitive debut for Chelsea as a substitute against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/10241983/Chelsea-2-Hull-City-0-match-report.html|title=Chelsea 2 Hull City 0: match report|date=18 August 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Henry|last=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2013, he played his first [[UEFA Champions League]] game in a 2–1 home defeat by [[FC Basel|Basel]]. On 24 September, in a [[2013–14 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], Van Ginkel suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|injury]] that kept him out of play for around seven months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10335638/Chelseas-Marco-van-Ginkel-expected-to-be-out-for-six-to-nine-months-after-tearing-anterior-cruciate-ligament.html|title=Chelsea's Marco van Ginkel expected to be out for six to nine months after tearing anterior cruciate ligament|date=26 September 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his competitive return to football in Chelsea's under-21s' match away to Manchester United on 21 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2586509/Chelsea-youngster-Van-Ginkel-returns-injury-U21-clash-United.html|title=Chelsea youngster Van Ginkel returns from injury in U21 clash with United|publisher=Mail Online |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Milan====
On 1 September 2014, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] announced that Van Ginkel had joined the [[Serie A]] club on loan from Chelsea for the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15 season]]. During his loan spell, Van Ginkel wore the number 21 jersey, formerly owned by some of the great names of the club such as [[Andrea Pirlo]] and [[Mauro Tassotti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2014/8/31/6091101/chelsea-fc-transfer-news-marco-van-ginkel-joins-ac-milan |title=Done deal, Marco van Ginkel joins AC Milan|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his first appearance for Milan on the bench against [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 14 September 2014, but he did not make his debut until 23 September. On 23 September, he made his first start, as well as his debut, for Milan against [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]]. His debut, however, was cut short as he was taken off on a stretcher in the 34th minute after suffering an ankle injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/09/23/italy/serie-a/empoli-fc/ac-milan/1836161/ |title=Empoli vs. Milan  2 – 2|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/9/23/6835013/chelsea-fc-ac-milan-injury-news-marco-van-ginkel-taken-off-on-a-stretcher |title=Marco Van Ginkel taken off on a stretcher, Fernando Torres scores|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his injury, Van Ginkel made his way back on the bench on 19 October, as Milan faced [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]], but was an unused substitute. Van Ginkel would continue to be left on the bench without a single minute of game time, leading his agent, Karl Jansen, to speak out: "We aren't happy about that is clear. It [leaving Van Ginkel out] went against all logic. Marco didn't have to go to Italy, if he wasn't going to be used anyway. Milan agreed with that. A fit and in-form Van Ginkel plays his way into Milan's starting XI."
After Jasen speaking out for Van Ginkel, rumors started around about the possibly of Van Ginkel returning to Chelsea, or going on loan for another team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/11/4/7154787/marco-van-ginkel-ac-milan-loan |title=Van Ginkel agent troubled by Milan treatment|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November, Van Ginkel was finally deemed fit enough to start for Milan in a match against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. He played nearly the entire game, being substituted off for [[Riccardo Montolivo]] in the 89th minute in a 2–0 Milan victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/30/italy/serie-a/ac-milan/udinese-calcio/1836349/|title=Milan vs. Udinese  2 – 0|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following game, on 7 December, Van Ginkel was again left on the bench as an unused substitute as Milan crashed into a 1–0 defeat against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/12/07/italy/serie-a/genoa-cfc/ac-milan/1836365/|title=Genoa vs. Milan  1 – 0|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel took a turn for the worst as he picked up an ankle injury during practice caused by teammate [[Sulley Muntari]]. The tackle from Muntari was described as "hard challenge, but it was not a violent challenge" by head coach [[Filippo Inzaghi]]; with the injury, Van Ginkel was ruled out for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/12/15/7393511/more-bad-news-for-marco-van-ginkel|title=More bad news for Marco van Ginkel|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his return to the bench on 18 January 2015, but it was not until 24 January that Van Ginkel made his return onto the pitch, playing against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]; he was substituted off in the 55th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/24/italy/serie-a/ss-lazio-roma/ac-milan/1836487/|title=LAZIO VS.

MILAN  1 – 2|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 9 May, he scored the opener in a 2–1 home victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32589603|title=AC Milan boss Filippo Inzaghi was sent to the stands as his side beat Roma to record a first win in six games. |date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel was given the number 28 jersey upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=PSV hires Marco van Ginkel |url=http://www.psv.nl/psv/nieuws/artikel/psv-huurt-marco-van-ginkel.htm |publisher=PSV Eindhoven |date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his PSV debut against [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] in the quarter-finals of the [[KNVB Cup]], which ended in a 3–1 loss for PSV.

==Style of play==
Van Ginkel primarily plays as a central midfielder but has been lauded for his ability to play in a multitude of positions including defensive midfield and across the attacking midfield.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} From his early playing days at Vitesse, he has primarily played in an attacking role, though he has matured in his ability to play in a deeper defensive role. Van Ginkel is recognized as a solid, well-rounded player who has all the tools of a future superstar. On the pitch he is widely known for his maturity on the ball, impressive ball control and an extensive range of passing. He is comfortable with both feet, makes intelligent runs into the box and has an exceptional long-range shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/marco-van-ginkel-profile-chelsea-2028133 |title=Marco van Ginkel profile: Chelsea new boy can become 'a hybrid of Frank Lampard and vintage Michael Essien' |publisher=Mirror Football |accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ginkel has described himself as "a real box-to-box player.

Former Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] spoke of the youngster, likening him to [[England national football team|England]] greats [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Steven Gerrard]]. He has described Van Ginkel as an engine with immense physical power. As with several others, Mourinho was quick to point out his overall game: "He covers a fantastic area of the field defensively and after that he has this instinct where he wants to go into finishing areas, he wants to score goals. He’s very good in the air."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Eduardo dos Reis Carvalho''' ({{IPA-pt|iˈðwaɾðu kɐɾˈvaʎu}}; born 19 September 1982), known simply as '''Eduardo''', is a Portuguese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for Dutch club [[SBV Vitesse]] on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]].

He appeared in 134 [[Primeira Liga]] games over ten seasons, almost always representing [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. He also played professionally in Italy, Turkey, Croatia and England.

After winning the first of his 36 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in 2009, Eduardo was part of the squads in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] and as many [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]], starting in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 edition of the former tournament]].

==Club career==
Eduardo was born in [[Mirandela]], [[Bragança District]]. A product of [[S.C. Braga]]'s youth system, he first appeared in the [[Primeira Liga]] during [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|2006–07]] when he served a six-month loan at [[S.C. Beira-Mar]]. In [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|the following season]] he was also loaned, this time to [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]], and was as a key player in a [[Carlos Carvalhal]]-led side that [[2007–08 Taça da Liga|won]] the inaugural [[Taça da Liga|Portuguese League Cup]] and thus [[2008–09 UEFA Cup|qualified]] for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], with a ''[[Man of the match]]'' display in the final against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] where he saved three attempts in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/taca-da-liga/detalhe/carlos-carvalhal-eduardo-da-pontos-e-tacas.html|title=Carlos Carvalhal: "Eduardo dá pontos e Taças"|trans-title=Carlos Carvalhal: "Eduardo gives points and Cups"|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=22 March 2008|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eduardo returned to Braga for the [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|2008–09 campaign]], playing in all the league matches and also in the [[Minho Province|Minho]] team's [[2008–09 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup round-of-16 run]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/sp--braga/detalhe/eduardo-arrasado.html|title=Eduardo arrasado|trans-title=Eduardo destroyed|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same happened in [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|the following year]] – with them finishing in their best-ever position, second – as he only conceded 20 goals, joint-best in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsf.pt/desporto/interior/guarda-redes-eduardo-nao-promete-continuidade-no-braga-1568007.html|title=Guarda-redes Eduardo não promete continuidade no Braga|trans-title=Goalkeeper Eduardo does not promise to remain at Braga|publisher=[[TSF (radio station)|TSF]]|language=pt|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2010, Eduardo signed a four-year contract with [[Serie A]]'s [[Genoa C.F.C.]] for €4.8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genoacfc.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10055&amp;Itemid=31|title=Un altro colpo Mondiale per il Genoa|trans-title=Another World Cup strike for Genoa|publisher=Genoa C.F.C|language=it|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genoa C.F.C.

Eduardo started all the games but one for the Italians in [[2010–11 Serie A|his first and only season]], in a final midtable position. In July 2011 he returned to his country and joined [[S.L.

On 27 June 2014, Eduardo joined several compatriots at Croatian side [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb]] after agreeing to a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnkdinamo.hr/hr/novosti/vijesti/veliko-pojacanje-na-golu-eduardo-potpisao-za-dinamo!.html|title=Veliko pojačanje na golu: Eduardo potpisao za Dinamo!|trans-title=Big boost in goal: Eduardo signs for Dinamo!|publisher=GNK Dinamo Zagreb|language=hr|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2016, after 95 competitive appearances, he signed with [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a one-year deal, being brought in to provide experienced cover and competition to [[Thibaut Courtois]] and [[Asmir Begović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/08/eduardo-transfer-completed.html|title=Eduardo transfer completed|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=25 August 2016|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his team being crowned [[2016–17 Premier League|league champions]], Eduardo did not receive a medal as he did not appear in any games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/13/which-chelsea-players-wont-receive-premier-league-winners-medals-6634995/|title=Which Chelsea players WON’T receive Premier League winners’ medals?|publisher=Metro|date=13 May 2017|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to a one-year contract extension on 23 May 2017, with technical director [[Michael Emenalo]] calling him "a model professional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/05/new-deal-for-eduardo.html|title=New deal for Eduardo|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=23 May 2017|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being listed on Chelsea's released list following the conclusion of [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18]], Eduardo signed a new one-year contract in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportwitness.co.uk/chelsea-player-signs-one-year-extension-loaned-strange-move/|title=Chelsea player signs one year extension to be loaned out, strange move|publisher=Sport Witness|author=Lucas Sposito|date=5 July 2018|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the same month, he agreed to join Dutch team [[SBV Vitesse]] on a [[2018–19 Eredivisie|season]]-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2018/7/6/eduardo-moves-to-vitesse|title=Eduardo loaned to Vitesse|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=6 July 2018|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut on 26 July 2018, in a 2–2 draw away to [[FC Viitorul Constanța]] for the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|Europa League second qualifying round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omroepgelderland.nl/nieuws/2321194/Vitesse-wint-van-Viitorul-en-gaat-door-in-Europa|title=Vitesse wint van Viitorul en gaat door in Europa|trans-title=Vitesse beat Viitorul and remain in Europe|publisher=[[Omroep Gelderland]]|language=nl|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
After [[UEFA Euro 2008]], Eduardo was called up by new [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]] coach [[Carlos Queiroz]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifiers]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], where he was understudy to [[Quim (footballer, born 1975)|Quim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jn.pt/desporto/interior/primeiro-treino-de-queiroz-rumo-ao-mundial-de-2010-981425.html|title=Primeiro treino de Queiroz rumo ao Mundial de 2010|trans-title=First Queiroz training towards 2010 World Cup|newspaper=Jornal de Notícias|language=pt|date=19 August 2008|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full debut on 11 February 2009 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] with [[Finland national football team|Finland]], playing the first 60 minutes in a 1–0 home win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acorianooriental.pt/noticia/179818|title=Portugal vence Finlândia 1–0 em jogo particular|trans-title=Portugal beat Finland 1–0 in friendly game|newspaper=Açoriano Oriental|language=pt|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained the starter throughout the remainder of the qualifying campaign; he also started in the final stages in South Africa, keeping [[Shutout|clean sheets]] against [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_13/default.stm|title=Ivory Coast 0–0 Portugal|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/sports/soccer/22portugalgame.html|title=Portugal pours it on in second half|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_45/default.stm|title=Portugal 0–0 Brazil|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only conceding in the [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]] loss against eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (0–1), where he saved many shots from the opposition, mostly by [[David Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/29/spain-portugal-world-cup-2010-report|title=World Cup 2010: David Villa raises the roof as Spain push past Portugal|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=6/news=eduardo-laments-opportunity-missed-1264342.html|title=Eduardo laments opportunity missed|publisher=FIFA|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being relegated to the bench at his club, Eduardo met the same fate in the national team to [[Rui Patrício]], and both finished the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualifying campaign]] with five games as Portugal qualified for the finals. He was also named in the squad of 23 for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/portugal/10810443/Portugal-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Portugal World Cup 2014 squad|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only actually played five minutes in the last group stage match against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], coming on for injured [[Beto (footballer, born 1982)|Beto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255931/match=300186476/match-report.html|title=Ronaldo downs Ghana but Portugal crash out|publisher=FIFA|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
====Early career====
Ola Aina signed for Chelsea as an under-11 and made his youth team debut as a schoolboy in the 2012–13 season and went on to start in both legs of the semi-final and final of the FA Youth Cup. In his youth career, he has also represented Chelsea in the under-18s, under-19s, and under-21 levels.&lt;ref name="Chelsea Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/ola-aina.html |title=Ola Aina Chelsea Profile |accessdate=23 August 2016 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, Aina made his first-team debut in a pre-season friendly against [[AFC Wimbledon]], after [[Todd Kane]]'s injury. Aina started the match and was [[Substitute (association football)|substituted]] at half-time for [[Branislav Ivanović]] as Chelsea went on to win 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2014/07/afc-wimbledon-v-chelsea.html |title=Match report: AFC Wimbledon 2 Chelsea 3 |date=19 July 2014 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 2015–16 season, he was included in the pre-season tour, playing three matches in the [[2015 International Champions Cup|International Champions Cup]]. After impressing Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], Aina was included in the first-team squad for the [[2015–16 Chelsea F.C. season|campaign]]. Although he spent the entire season training full-time with the first-team, he continued his role in the under-21s and under-19s sides.&lt;ref name="Chelsea Profile" /&gt; On 23 September 2015, Aina was included in the match-day squad against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in the fourth round of the [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]], although he was an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34265632 |title=Walsall 1–4 Chelsea |date=23 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sports|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of first-team opportunities, Aina refused a new contract despite his current contact ending at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-join-transfer-race-sign-7161465 |title=Arsenal join transfer race to sign Chelsea's England Under-21 right-back Ola Aina |date=11 January 2016|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to play in all six pre-season matches.

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Dasilva joined Chelsea from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in 2012, aged just thirteen, along with his brothers Cole and Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088254/Jay-Rio-Cole-Dasilva-Footballing-brothers-aged-just-12-13-signed-Chelsea.html|title=Now that's a hat-trick! The three footballing brothers aged just 12 and 13 signed by Chelsea in deal that could net their club £1m|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2017|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly integrated into the club's youth setup, making his under-18 debut as an under-15 the following year. The following season, he made 23 appearances for the youth team, including scoring in the [[2013–14 FA Youth Cup]] final first leg against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2615464/Fulham-3-Chelsea-2-Charly-Musondas-late-strike-boosts-Blues-Youth-Cup-final.html|title=Fulham 3 Chelsea 2: Charly Musonda's late strike boosts Blues in Youth Cup final|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=14 January 2017|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second full season with the under-18s, Dasilva won the [[2014–15 FA Youth Cup]], as well as the [[2014–15 UEFA Youth League]], playing all but one game in the UEFA Youth League. He signed his first professional contract in July 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squawka.com/news/chelsea-sign-jay-dasilva-to-a-professional-contract/415188|title=Chelsea sign Jay Da Silva to a professional contract|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=Squawka}}&lt;/ref&gt; having forced himself into Chelsea's under-21 side, where he established himself as a key player over the next year. He became one of the only players in history to win three [[FA Youth Cup]]s, alongside teammate [[Jake Clarke-Salter]] and five of the famed [[Busby Babes]], when he was part of the Chelsea side that lifted the [[2015–16 FA Youth Cup]].&lt;ref name="Chelsea Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/on-loan-players/jay-dasilva.html|title=Jay Dasilva|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Chelsea side that claimed the [[2015–16 UEFA Youth League]], however he was an unused substitute in the final victory against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000699/match=2019575/index.html|title=Chelsea defeat Paris to retain Youth League title|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomáš Kalas''' (born 15 May 1993) is a Czech professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], on loan from [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He plays as a [[centre back]], but has also been played as a [[right back]].

Having begun his career at [[Sigma Olomouc]], he signed for Chelsea for a reported £5.2 million in 2010. He spent most of his tenure out on loan, first back at Sigma, then at [[Vitesse Arnhem]], [[1. FC Köln]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

Kalas earned 42 caps and scored once for the Czech youth international teams, and made his senior international debut in 2012.

==Club career==

===Chelsea===

====Early career====
Born in [[Olomouc]], Kalas started his career in his hometown with [[SK Sigma Olomouc|Sigma Olomouc]], making his debut in a 2–0 victory over [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] on 5 May 2010.&lt;ref name="Thomas Kalas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Kalas|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/thomas-kalas/129944/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then signed for [[Premier League]] champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], on 7 July 2010, for a reported figure of around £5.2&amp;nbsp;million, although it was agreed that he would stay at Sigma Olomouc for the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name="Chelsea sign teenage Czech defender Tomas Kalas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8797276.stm|title=Chelsea sign teenage Czech defender Tomas Kalas|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalas arrived at Chelsea for the second half of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] and made his Chelsea [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] debut in a 2–2 away draw to [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|Aston Villa]] on 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TheReservesNews/0,,10268~2298926,00.html | title=Reserve Report: Aston Villa 2 Chelsea 2 | accessdate=3 March 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320140716/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TheReservesNews/0,,10268~2298926,00.html | archivedate=20 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2011 Kalas joined Dutch football club [[Vitesse Arnhem]] on [[Loan (association football)|loan]] for the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vitesse.nl/nieuws/bericht/presentatie-nieuwe-nummer-2-tomas-kalas/1784 | title=Presentatie nieuwe nummer 2: Tomáš Kalas | accessdate=22 August 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104155705/http://www.vitesse.nl/nieuws/bericht/presentatie-nieuwe-nummer-2-tomas-kalas/1784 | archivedate=4 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the number 2 jersey. He made his debut for Vitesse on 17 September 2011 against [[Roda JC Kerkrade]] which ended in a 5–0 win for Vitesse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2011/9/22/2442698/chelsea-fc-loan-roundup-9-22-11 | title=Chelsea FC loan roundup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Kalas admitted that he did not yet know where he will be playing next season, but was happy on loan at Vitesse. "Ideally I'll stay another year at this club," he told. "Simply put, there are three options. I'll stay here, go back to Chelsea or they will loan me to another club abroad. In late March I will talk with my managers about next season and know more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7601619/Kalas-unsure-over-future | title=Kalas unsure over future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2012, Kalas scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute, for Vitesse against RKC Waalwijk; the match ended in a 3–1 win for Vitesse. This goal was Kalas' first goal of his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/05/17/netherlands/eredivisie/rkc-waalwijk/sbv-vitesse/1283674/ | title=RKC Waalwijk vs. Vitesse  1 – 3 |publisher=US Soccerway | accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2012, Kalas rejoined Vitesse on a new loan deal until the end of the [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13]] season. He also extended his contract with Chelsea until the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2841591,00.html | title=VITESSE LOANS FOR YOUNG PAIR | publisher=Chelseafc.com | accessdate=11 July 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714024653/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2841591,00.html | archivedate=14 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kalas scored his first Eredivisie goal of the season for Vitesse in a 3–0 defeat of [[FC Groningen]] on 16 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/gamecast/statistics/id/343517/statistics.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |title=FC Groningen 0 – 3 Vitesse Arnhem |publisher=ESPNFC |date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second loan spell at Vitesse, Kalas was mainly deployed as a right-back instead of his natural centre-back. Kalas ended up playing a total of 76 games overall competition during his two-year stay at Vitesse.

====2013–2015====
On 10 July 2013 Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] confirmed Kalas would stay and fight for his place at Chelsea for the coming season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3234245/title/mourinho-early-report---part-one|title=Home|website=ChelseaFC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802041005/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3234245/title/mourinho-early-report---part-one|archivedate=2 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Chelsea's 2013 pre-season Asia tour, Kalas made 3 appearances for Chelsea, in wins against the Singha All Stars, the Malaysian XI, and the Indonesian XI. During pre-season training, Kalas suffered fractured fibula, cutting his action with the first-team short as the rest of the team flew over to America for the [[2013 International Champions Cup|Guinness International Champions Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomas Kalas suffers fractured fibula and will be out for about a month|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2013/7/30/4572860/tomas-kalas-injury-out-for-one-month/|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finally recovered from his injuries, Kalas made his competitive debut for the senior squad on 29 October 2013 as a substitute for Juan Mata, in a 2–0 win at Arsenal in the [[Football League Cup|Capital One Cup]]. Speaking of his role at Chelsea, Kalas said in an interview with a Czech chat show: "I am a player for training sessions. If they need a cone they put me there instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KHaring75/status/460396999670779904|title=Karel Häring|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2014, Kalas made his [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut against [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], replacing Willian in stoppage time; Chelsea won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea vs. Galatasaray  2 – 0

On 27 April 2014, Kalas was given his debut in the [[Premier League]] for Chelsea, at [[Anfield]] against Liverpool, starting in place of the injured [[John Terry]]. He played the whole 90 minutes in a 2–0 win that kept Chelsea in contention for the league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEAM NEWS: LIVERPOOL V CHELSEA|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3790508/title/team-news-liverpool-v-chelsea|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2014, [[1. FC Köln]] announced that Kalas would spend the 2014–15 season on loan at their club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FC leiht Tomas Kalas aus|url=http://www.fc-koeln.de/news/detailansicht/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=7838&amp;cHash=94f330fc63ab4a1f13e2f770879a4c9a|publisher=1.

Kalas, himself, did not know why he had been given the cold shoulder at Köln, where he played only two reserve games. During an interview, Kalas said "At first they were happy with my performances but then I didn’t play in {{sic|any game}}. I don’t know what went wrong." With the lack of playing time, Kalas was linked to a move to multiple English clubs, as well as his former team Vitesse in the January 2015 [[transfer window]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomas Kalas set for change of scene with Chelsea 'nervous and disappointed' over Koln loan|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537270/Tomas-Kalas-Koln-loan-Chelsea-January-move|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–====
On 9 January 2015, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] announced that Kalas would spend the remainder of the 2014–15 season on loan at the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KALAS LOAN TO MIDDLESBROUGH|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/news/article/2014/chelsea-tomas-kalas-boro-aitor-karanka-stamford-bridge-2193371.aspx|accessdate=9 January 2015|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after signing with the Boro, Kalas made his debut for Middlesbrough in a 0–0 draw against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Sport – Reading v Middlesbrough|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30663415|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Aitor Karanka]] praised Kalas' aptitude to the right-back position, where Middlesbrough had been challenged following a long-term injury to [[Damià Abella]] in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomas Kalas: Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka happy with full-back|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30778977|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalas retained his position as the right-back against [[Huddersfield Town]] and [[Cardiff City]]. During the game against Cardiff City on 20 January 2015, Kalas suffered a high ankle sprain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middlesbrough vs. Cardiff City  2 – 1|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/20/england/championship/middlesbrough-football-club/cardiff-city-fc/1705283/|accessdate=20 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2015, Kalas returned to the starting line-up in a 2–1 away win against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blackpool vs Middlesbrough  1 – 2|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/02/10/england/championship/blackpool-fc/middlesbrough-football-club/1705353/|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2015, Kalas provided an assist to fellow Chelsea loanee [[Patrick Bamford]] as Middlesbrough beat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] 2–1 at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middlesbrough vs. Wolves  2 – 1|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3038837/Middlesbrough-2-1-Wolves-Patrick-Bamford-inspires-Boro-secure-play-position.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omeruo had an up and down season, suffering from a couple injuries, however started whenever he was fit.

'''Abdul Rahman Baba''', commonly known as '''Baba Rahman''' (born 2 July 1994) is a Ghanaian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] for [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade de Reims|Reims]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and for the [[Ghana national football team|Ghana national team]].

Beginning his career at [[Dreams F.C. (Ghana)|Dreams FC]], he played in the [[Ghanaian Premier League]] with [[Asante Kotoko]]. In 2012, he signed for [[Bundesliga]] club [[Greuther Fürth]], where he spent two seasons. He then played for [[FC Augsburg]] before joining Chelsea in 2015 for a fee of £14 million, potentially rising to £22 million.

Rahman made his international debut in 2014 and was part of their squad which were runners-up at the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].

==Club career==

===Ghana===
Rahman began his career at [[Dreams F.C. (Ghana)|Dreams FC]] of the [[Ghana Football Leagues|Ghana Division Two]]. After impressive performances, he was then transferred on loan to [[Asante Kotoko SC|Asante Kotoko]] of the [[Ghanaian Premier League]] for one season.&lt;ref name="German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman" /&gt;

For the 2012 season, Rahman was a finalist for the league's Discovery of the Year Award, eventually losing to [[Joshua Oniku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Nii Adjei wins Player of the Season Award|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=242181|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a sought after player during his time with the [[Kumasi]]-based club, serious enquiries were made about the player by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] of the [[Premier League]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] of [[Serie A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenal, Man City deals loom for Kotoko left-back Abdul-Rahman|url=http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/arsenal-man-city-deals-loom-for-kotoko-left-back-abdul-rahman/|publisher=GhanaSoccerNet|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
However, Rahman eventually signed with newly promoted [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|Greuther Fürth]] in the [[Bundesliga]] on 12 June 2012. Rahman stated that his decision to join Fürth was because the club offered, "the best conditions in which to develop my career."&lt;ref name="German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman"&gt;{{cite web|title=German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman|url=http://www.mtnfootball.com/africa/ghana/news/2012/june/13-german-club-greuther-furth-beats-arsenal-to-sign-rahman.html|publisher=MTN Football|accessdate=20 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707170745/http://www.mtnfootball.com/africa/ghana/news/2012/june/13-german-club-greuther-furth-beats-arsenal-to-sign-rahman.html|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the derby against [[1. FC Nürnberg]] on 11 August 2014 he scored his first two goals for Fürth in a 5–1 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doppelpacker Baba lässt das Kleeblatt tanzen|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/spieltag/2-bundesliga/2014-15/2/2407543/spielanalyse_spvgg-greuther-fuerth-82_1-fc-nuernberg-81.html|publisher=kicker.de|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he signed with [[FC Augsburg]] of the same division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baba-Wechsel zum FCA perfekt|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/vereine/609563/artikel_baba-wechsel-zum-fca-perfekt.html|publisher=kicker.de|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rahman's 2014–15 season with Augsburg, he made 108 tackles, more than any other player in the Bundesliga that season. Using aspects of his strength and pace, he was able to win 90 of those tackles, coming out to an 83% successful tackle rate. That season, Rahman also had 83 interceptions and won 80 contested aerial balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chelsea transfer news: Who is Baba Rahman?|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11795039/Chelsea-transfer-news-Who-is-Baba-Rahman.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
====2015–16 season====
On 16 August 2015, Rahman signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee, reported to be an initial £14 million, rising to a potential fee of almost £22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Baba Rahman moves to Stamford Bridge from Augsburg  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33953803 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Rahman signs  |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/08/rahman-signs.html |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Baba moves to Chelsea  |url=http://fcaugsburg.de/cms/website.php?id=/index/news/allenews/data21397.htm |publisher=FC Augsburg |date=16 August 2015}} {{dead link|date=February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dudko|first1=James|title=Baba Rahman Completes Transfer to Chelsea from Augsburg|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2529710-baba-rahman-transfer-news-latest-rumours-speculation-on-augsburg-defender|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 September in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–1 win away to [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walsall 1-4 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34265632|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut in a 2–0 win over [[Aston Villa]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 17 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawkes|first1=Phil|title=Chelsea 2-0 Aston Villa|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34493710|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman has played an important role at left-back in a couple of Chelsea's victories including their 2–1 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] win over [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]; Sportsmail's Bob Treasure said that Rahman "was very lively at left back" and that he "showed excellent anticipation to make a handful of interceptions and start attacking moves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chelsea 2-1 Dynamo Kiev PLAYER RATINGS|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3304178/Chelsea-2-1-Dynamo-Kiev-PLAYER-RATINGS-Willian-shows-class-Baba-Rahman-catches-eye-Blues-clinch-Champions-League-win-Stamford-Bridge.html|website = Mail Online|access-date = 13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman also played the full 90 minutes against French side [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in Chelsea's 2–1 Champions League defeat on 16 February 2016. Rahman was presented with this opportunity following the injuries to centre-backs Kurt Zouma and John Terry. Although Chelsea failed to stop PSG from scoring twice, "Rahman looked like a class full back" according to Kristian Downer for Metro.co.uk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five things we learned from Chelsea's Champions League defeat in Paris|url = http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/17/five-things-we-learned-from-chelseas-champions-league-defeat-against-paris-saint-germain-5692170/ |website = Metro |accessdate = 20 February 2016 |first = Kristian Downer for |last = Metro.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baba Rahman 20160416.jpg|thumb|Baba Rahman playing for Chelsea in 2016]]
On 27 February, Rahman made an error which allowed [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[Shane Long]] to score in the 42nd minute; he was substituted for [[Kenedy (footballer)|Kenedy]] at half time but Chelsea eventually won 2–1 at [[St. Mary's Stadium|St. Mary's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Southampton 1-2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35619625|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schalke 04 (loan)====
On 2 August 2016, Schalke confirmed that Baba Rahman has moved on a season-long loan to the club after failing to impress the new Chelsea manager [[Antonio Conte]] during pre-season. Baba was given the number 14 jersey for the upcoming season. His return to [[Bundesliga]] links him back with former Augsburg manager, [[Markus Weinzierl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/08/baba-makes-schalke-switch.html|title=Baba makes Schalke switch|last=|first=|date=2 August 2016|website=www.chelseafc.com|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schalke04.de/en/news/160802_baba/page/2362--86-86-.html|title=Abdul Rahman Baba joins S04 on loan|date=2 August 2016|website=www.schalke04.de|publisher=FC Schalke 04|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the completion of this loan move, Rahman told the local paper Ruhr Nachrichten, [[Antonio Conte]] advised him to leave on loan because he was mainly focused on a defensive philosophy. With the defensive focus, Rahman was told his playing-time would be very limited due to his attacking-style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/english-premier-league/story/2922205/baba-rahman-too-attacking-for-chelsea-manager-antonio-conte|title=Baba Rahman 'too attacking' for Chelsea manager Antonio Conte|last=Buczko|first=Stefan|publisher=ESPN|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman made his competitive debut for the [[Gelsenkirchen]] team on 20 August, as a winger instead of a defender in a 4–1 victory against [[FC 08 Villingen]] in the first round of the [[2016–17 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/08/20/germany/dfb-pokal/fc-08-villingen/fc-schalke-04/2244383/|title=Villingen 1-4 Schalke 04|date=20 August 2016|publisher=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut on 27 August, coming on for [[Sead Kolašinac]] in the 62nd minute of an eventual 1–0 loss at [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] on the first day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frankfurt hold on to beat Schalke|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/blmd1n-eintracht-frankfurt-1-0-fc-schalke-04-report.jsp|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Bundesliga|date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman scored his first goal for Schalke on 15 September, the game's only in a Europa League victory at [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nice 0-1 Schalke: Baba Rahman's late strike earns Schalke victory over Nice as Mario Balotelli fails to shine for Ligue 1 outfit|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3791677/Nice-0-1-Schalke-Baba-Rahman-s-late-strike-earns-Schalke-victory-Nice-Mario-Balotelli-fails-shine-Ligue-1-outfit.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schalke 04 (second loan)====
In January 2018, Rahman joined [[FC Schalke 04]] on loan for the second time agreeing an 18-month stay until summer 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cann|first1=James|title=Chelsea left-back Baba Rahman joins Schalke on 18-month loan|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/chelsea-leftback-baba-rahman-joins-schalke-on-18month-loan-36543246.html|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Irish Independent|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bis 2019: Schalke leiht Baba erneut aus|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/715626/artikel_bis-2019_schalke-leiht-baba-erneut-aus.html|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=kicker Online|date=29 January 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reims (loan)====
In January 2019, he returned early to Chelsea and was immediately loaned to [[Stade de Reims]] until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baba Rahman loaned to Reims|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/1/28/baba-rahman-loaned-to-reims/|work=Chelsea FC|date=29 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Rahman played every minute of [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]'s campaign at the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[Equatorial Guinea]], providing the cross from which [[André Ayew]] headed in the winner against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] to win [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations Group C|Group C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa 1-2 Ghana|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30891882|accessdate=17 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations Final|final]] against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], Rahman scored in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] in which his team lost 9–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Alan|title=Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/feb/08/africa-cup-of-nations-final-ivory-coast-v-ghana-live|accessdate=17 August 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He required surgery and was ruled out for six months.&lt;ref name=injury&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurt Zouma: Chelsea defender out for six months &amp; needs surgery|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35527443|accessdate=9 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Zouma traveled and trained with the first-team during preseason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/07/zouma--coming-back-stronger.html |title=Zouma: Coming back stronger |date=20 July 2016 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea also rejected a loan offer from [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/704672/Chelsea-Antonio-Conte-Schalke-Kurt-Zouma-Premier-League-John-Terry-Gary-Cahill-News |title=Chelsea in talks with Schalke over transfer of young defender |date=28 August 2016|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, Zouma made his first competitive appearance after being out of action for nine months, playing 45 minutes for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Chelsea under-23]] side in a 2–2 draw against Derby County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/10/pl2-report--chelsea-v-derby-county.html |title=PL2 report: Chelsea 2 Derby 2 |date=24 October 2016 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2017, Zouma made his first team comeback in Chelsea's 4–1 [[2016–17 FA Cup|FA Cup]] third-round win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/chelsea-peterborough-united-fa-cup-match-report|title=John Terry sees red but comfortable Chelsea ease past Peterborough|date=9 January 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, he made his first appearance of the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season as a substitute in a 3–1 win against rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/feb/04/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-live|title=Chelsea 3–1 Arsenal|date=1 March 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season: Loan to Stoke City====
Following agreeing to a new six-year deal with Chelsea, on 21 July 2017, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on loan for the [[2017–18 Stoke City F.C. season|2017–18]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zouma signs new deal and heads to Stoke |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/07/new-contract-and-loan-for-zouma.html |publisher=Chelsea Official Site |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurt Zouma: Chelsea defender joins Stoke on season-long loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40684771|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August, he made his debut in a 1–0 loss at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/everton-vs-stoke/373101 |title=Everton 1–0 Stoke |date=12 August 2017 |publisher=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Stoke captain [[Ryan Shawcross]] expressed his surprise that Chelsea had loaned out Zouma, who had only missed one match, against his parent club.&lt;ref name=shawcross&gt;{{cite news|title=Ryan Shawcross surprised Chelsea allowed 'ultimate defender' Kurt Zouma to leave on loan|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11701/11128404/ryan-shawcross-surprised-chelsea-allowed-ultimate-defender-kurt-zouma-to-leave-on-loan|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=Sky Sports|date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November he headed his first goal for the Potters, in a 2–2 draw at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bysouth|first1=Alex|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2–2 Stoke City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41964596|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma played 37 matches for Stoke in 2017–18 as the club suffered relegation to the [[EFL Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swansea 1–2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44020155|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season: Loan to Everton====
On 10 August 2018, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan for the [[2018–19 Everton F.C. season|2018–19]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/08/10/zouma|title=Zouma Joins Everton On Season-Long Loan|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018|publisher=Everton Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 25 August as a last-minute substitute for the injured [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]] in a 2–2 draw at [[A.F.C.

==International career==
Zouma is a [[France national youth football team|France youth international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] and [[France national under-17 football team|under-17]] level. He played with the under-17 team at the [[2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] and [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Zouma has been the captain for the [[France national under-21 football team|French under-21]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zouma strike makes it a perfect six for France|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000412/match=2011566/postmatch/report/index.html|publisher=UEFA|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[France national under-20 football team|under-20 team]] that won the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2013 World Cup]] in Turkey. In the quarter-finals against [[Uzbekistan national under-20 football team|Uzbekistan]] in [[Rize]], he headed the last goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbeks no match for in-form France|url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/matches/round=259231/match=300234903/match-report.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=FIFA|date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] wanted to build a defence around Zouma and fellow youngster [[Raphaël Varane]],&lt;ref name=four/&gt; and on 19 March 2015, he was called him up for the first time for friendlies against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=Nabil Fekir and Kurt Zouma named in France squad for friendlies|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/international-friendly/story/2356374/nabil-fekir-and-kurt-zouma-named-in-france-squad-for-friendlies|accessdate=20 March 2015|publisher=ESPN|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the latter match ten days later, a 2–0 win at his former club ground with Saint-Étienne, the [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], replacing [[Morgan Schneiderlin]] for the last eight minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France 2–0 Denmark: Lacazette and Giroud on target|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/france-vs-denmark/1703395/report?ICID=MP_MS_5|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Goal.com|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his injury for Chelsea in February, Zouma missed France's hosting of [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref name=injury/&gt;

He returned to the squad in August 2017, replacing the injured [[Raphaël Varane]] for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualifier]] against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-uefa/story/3190974/stoke-defender-kurt-zouma-replaces-raphael-varane-in-france-squad |title=Stoke defender Kurt Zouma replaces Raphael Varane in France squad |date=28 August 2017 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put on standby for France's squad at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Michael|title=World Cup 2018: Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City stars included in France's squad for finals|url=https://talksport.com/football/world-cup-2018-chelsea-manchester-united-and-manchester-city-stars-included-frances-squad|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=Talksport|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma earned his first France cap in over three years on 11 October 2018 as a substitute in a 2–2 friendly draw with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], coming on as a substitute and winning the equalising penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pringle |first1=Ben |title=Chelsea player ratings – International break: Morata and Giroud flop again, Ampadu injured |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1030543/Chelsea-player-ratings-international-break-Morata-Giroud-Ampadu |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Daily Express |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Kurt Zouma (03-08-2011).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zouma with Saint-Étienne in 2011]]
A November 2013 report by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' noted Zouma's strength, reading of the game, and aerial presence, while mentioning his occasional lapses in concentration.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Tim|title=Everything you need to know about... Kurt Zouma|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/everything-you-need-know-about-kurt-zouma#:LTIsiA1MqkpNyA|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=FourFourTwo|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Zouma was named by British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. The newspaper wrote, "Blessed with exceptional power and technique, Zouma is also coveted by many for his leadership qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/19/next-10-big-things-europes-top-youngsters|title=The next 10 big things: Europe's top youngsters and stars of the future|date=18 January 2014|work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Match of the Day]]'' pundit, [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] linked Zouma to [[Marcel Desailly]], another Frenchman who played in defence for Chelsea. Writing after a draw with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], which included a strong run and perfectly-executed sliding tackle on [[Sergio Agüero]], Murphy noted Zouma's reliability and confidence against the strong opponent, in addition to his pace. He predicted that Zouma could be a Chelsea mainstay for years to come, and would be an ideal replacement for captain [[John Terry]], then aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Danny|title=Chelsea 1–1 Man City: 'Kurt Zouma reminds me of Marcel Desailly'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31078757|accessdate=1 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawcross called Zouma the "ultimate defender" for his speed, jump, passing, shooting and tackling, and said that [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Toby Alderweireld]] was the only central defender on his level.&lt;ref name=shawcross/&gt;

==Personal life==
Zouma's parents emigrated to France from the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France: Kurt Zouma parle de la paix en Centrafrique|trans-title=France: Kurt Zouma speaks of peace in the Central African Republic|url=http://www.journaldebangui.com/article.php?aid=7416|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=Journal de Bangui|date=8 October 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother [[Lionel Zouma|Lionel]] plays in the same position for French club [[Football Bourg-en-Bresse Péronnas 01|Bourg-en Bresse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les retrouvailles des " jumeaux " Zouma|trans-title=The reunion of the Zouma "twins"|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/sports/les-retrouvailles-des-jumeaux-zouma-23-03-2014-3697943.php|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=23 March 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is named after Kurt Sloane, [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]'s character in the 1989 film [[Kickboxer (1989 film)|''Kickboxer'']], while his middle name Happy reflects an African tradition of using positive words as middle names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Menezes|first1=Jack|title=Chelsea vs Aston Villa: Kurt Zouma reveals he is named after Jean-Claude Van Damme...and why he has reason to smile all the time|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-vs-aston-villa-kurt-zouma-reveals-he-is-named-after-jean-claude-van-dammeand-why-he-has-9755954.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=The Independent|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is married to Sandra, with whom he has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo: Chelsea star relaxes with his kids at Stamford Bridge|url=http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/12/photo-chelsea-star-relaxes-with-his-kids-at-stamford-bridge/|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=The Sports Review|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea star Kurt Zouma takes his family to Disneyland Paris|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2794277/chelsea-star-kurt-zouma-takes-his-family-to-disneyland-paris|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=[[ESPN]] Soccer |author=Liam Twomey|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiémoué Bakayoko''' (born 17 August 1994) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He plays as a [[defensive midfielder]] due to his ability to break up play, but is considered to have all-round ability, as well as possessing physical power and athleticism, with France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] describing him as "a complete midfielder."

After suffering a broken leg as a young player, Bakayoko joined the academy at [[Rennes F.C.|Rennes]] at the age of 13. At 14, he was turned down by the [[Clairefontaine (football)|Clairfontaine]] academy. His senior career began at Rennes where he made 24 appearances before moving to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in 2014 for £7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; In his first two seasons at the club, Bakayoko made 31 Ligue 1 appearances, but was a regular starter in the [[2016–17 Ligue 1|2016–17 season]], contributing to Monaco's Ligue 1 title win as well as being named in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17 UEFA Champions League squad of the season]]. In 2017, he joined Chelsea for £40&amp;nbsp;million.

Bakayoko made his first senior international appearance for France in March 2017.

==Early life==
Bakayoko was born in Paris on 17 August 1994 and played for Paris 15sème O at the age of five.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; Aged nine, he played for CA Paris Charenton before moving to Montrogue FC 92.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; As a young player, Bakayoko suffered a broken leg which stopped him playing football for eight months.&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt; In 2008, at the age of 13, he joined the academy at Rennes.&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=Makelele made Chelsea target Bakayoko|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/3032516/tiemoue-bakayoko-chelsea-and-manchester-united-target-influenced-by-claude-makelele-and-yaya-toure|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; At 14, he was rejected by the renowned Clairefontaine academy.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;

==Club career==
===Rennes===
Bakayoko made his debut for the [[Ligue 1]] side on 24 August 2013 in a Ligue 1 match against [[Évian Thonon Gaillard F.C.|Évian TG]], playing the whole match in a 2–1 away win.&lt;ref name="OB_2Mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandey|first1=Kaustubh|title=Scout Report: Tiemoue Bakayoko {{!}} Monaco's midfield engine|url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2017/03/02/scout-report-tiemoue-bakayoko-monaco/|website=Outside of the Boot|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccerway1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/08/24/france/ligue-1/football-croix-de-savoie-74/stade-rennais-fc/1479069/|title=Evian vs. Rennes – 24 August 2013 |publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his first two seasons at Monaco, in which he made 31 Ligue 1 performances, Bakayoko decided to change his behaviour to fulfil his potential, which included moving from a luxury villa to an apartment and changing the colour of his car from pink to black.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt; Additionally, he began boxing, changed his diet and improved his strength.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt; He was helped by former France international [[Claude Makelele]], who had been appointed director of football at Monaco in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charles|first1=Andy|title=Claude Makelele named Monaco's new technical director|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11816/10122017/claude-makelele-named-monacos-new-technical-director|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how to improve his football and take care of himself off the pitch.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro_17Jul2017" /&gt; Bakayoko also sought advice from his former youth coach at Rennes, Yannick Menu.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt; As a result, and with [[Jérémy Toulalan]] and [[Mario Pašalić]] having both left the club in 2016, Bakayoko became a regular starter for Monaco, helping the club to the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season and named in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League squad of the season.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt; It was a decisive season for Bakayoko. Not only had he established himself as an important part of Monaco's team with consistent performances, he had fewer injuries and his application during training was no longer criticised.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;

During the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2016–17 UEFA Champions League round of 16-second leg match]] at the [[Stade Louis II]] on 15 March 2017, Bakayoko scored the final goal (it was his first ever [[UEFA Europa League]] or [[UEFA Champions League]] goal) with a header from a [[Thomas Lemar]] free-kick to help Monaco secure a vital goal against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Monaco won 3–1 and won the tie on the away goals rule (aggregate score 6–6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shamoon|first1=Hafez|title=Monaco 3–1 Manchester City (agg 6–6): Monaco win on away goals|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39248906|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview, Bakayoko said a recurrence of an knee injury from 2015 leading to a crack in the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] caused him a lot of discomfort during his final season at Monaco: "People don't know but throughout the whole of last season I suffered because of my knee.

On 15 July 2017, Bakayoko signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a five-year contract for a fee around the margin of £40&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bakayoko is a Blue |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/07/bakayoko-is-a-blue.html |publisher=Chelsea Official Site |date=15 July 2017 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro_17Jul2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Simon|title=Tiemoue Bakayoko confirms Chelsea legend was major influence|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/17/tiemoue-bakayoko-confirms-chelsea-legend-claude-makelele-played-major-role-in-his-development-6784766/|website=Metro|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the club's second most expensive signing at the time, after [[Fernando Torres]].&lt;ref name="Sky_17Jul2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lyall|title=Tiemoue Bakayoko seals £40m Chelsea transfer from Monaco|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10949875/tiemoue-bakayoko-completes-40m-chelsea-move-from-monaco|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=22 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Chelsea debut in a 2–1 away win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the Premier League on 20 August 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_20Aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Jonathan|title=Chelsea manager Antonio Conte praised the "commitment" of his team in a "moment that is not easy" as they bounced back from their opening-day loss to Burnley by beating Tottenham at Wembley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40914668|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February, he was sent off for the first time in his Chelsea career, in a 4–1 loss away to [[Watford FC|Watford]]. Bakayoko was given his marching orders for two bookable offences, one on [[Étienne Capoue]] and the other on [[Richarlison]], both in the first half.&lt;ref name="Express_6Feb2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banks|first1=Tony|title=Watford 4 – Chelsea 1: Conte on the brink, Bakayoko red card, Deeney swears at fans|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/914889/Watford-vs-Chelsea-Conte-sack-Bakayoko-red-card-Deeney-swears-fans|publisher=Daily Express|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakayoko failed to impress in his first season. He was criticised for his performances by fans and pundits alike, with games against both [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he was sent off after only 30 minutes, and a 3–0 away defeat by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on the last day of the Premier League season being singled out as two of his worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slagle |first1=Joel |url=https://www.footballparadise.com/tiemoue-bakayoko-anatomy/ |title=Tiémoué Bakayoko – The Anatomy of a Failed Signing |date=4 April 2018 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |publisher=Football Paradise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mokbel |first1=Sami |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5355275/Chelsea-fans-turn-Bakayoko-red-card-Watford.html |title='You’re f****** s***!'

Bakayoko continued his poor form into the [[2018–19 Chelsea F.C. season|2018–19 season]], finding himself culpable for [[Inter Milan]]'s equaliser in a 1–1 pre-season draw, having lost possession in midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/fixtures-results/chelsea-ratings-hudson-odoi-bakayoko-14964872 |title=Chelsea player ratings: Callum Hudson-Odoi electric but Tiemoue Bakayoko poor in Inter victory |date=28 July 2018 |accessdate=28 July 2018 |publisher=football.london}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Milan (loan)====
On 14 August 2018, Bakayoko signed for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan]] on a season-long [[Loan (sports)|loan]] for a fee of €5&amp;nbsp;million with an option to make the move permanent for €35&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/news/media/2018-08-14/official-announcement-tiemoue-bakayoko |title=Official announcement: Tiémoué Bakayoko |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=acmilan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3596086/ac-milan-sign-chelseas-tiemoue-bakayoko-on-season-long-loan|title=Milan sign Chelsea's Bakayoko on €5m loan|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career in Italy did not get off to a good start, and he was labelled 'confused’, ‘a disaster’, and ‘messy' after a poor performance in a [[UEFA Europa League]] game against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], in which he gifted the Greek side the opener in a 3-1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1027401/Tiemoue-Bakayoko-Chelsea-AC-Milan-Fabinho |title=Chelsea news: Italian media label Tiemoue Bakayoko ‘confused’, ‘a disaster’, and ‘messy' |last=Ward |first=Craig |publisher=The Express |date=5 October 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/06/on-loan-chelsea-midfielder-tiemoue-bakayoko-is-struggling-at-ac-milan-admits-gennaro-gattuso-8012034/ |title=On-loan Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is struggling at AC Milan, admits Gennaro Gattuso |publisher=The Metro |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his form improved dramatically late in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/gattuso-reveals-how-bakayoko-has-improved-50032|title=Gattuso reveals how Bakayoko has improved|work=Calciomercato.com {{!}} Tutte le news sul calcio in tempo reale|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Bakayoko was called up to the senior France squad for the first time to face [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and Spain in March 2017 after [[Paul Pogba]] withdrew through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Monégasque Bakayoko remplace Pogba chez les Bleus|url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/football/equipe-de-france/fil-info/le-monegasque-bakayoko-remplace-pogba-chez-les-bleus-850887|accessdate=18 March 2017|publisher=sport24.com|date=18 March 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 28 March 2017 against the latter, replacing [[Adrien Rabiot]] at half-time of a 2–0 friendly home loss.&lt;ref name="soccerway"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2017/03/28/world/friendlies/france/spain/2381549/|title=France vs. Spain – 28 March 2017 |publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shilton|first1=Alec|title=Monaco star Tiemoue Bakayoko 'arrives for medical ahead of £35m Chelsea move'|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/3892280/tiemoue-bakayoko-chelsea-london-medical/|website=The Sun|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Bakayoko has been compared to [[Yaya Touré]] due to his strong all-round qualities of pace, intelligent reading of the game, ability to intercept passes and accomplished tackling, passing and dribbling,&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yokhin|first1=Michael|title=Tiemoue Bakayoko: Meet Monaco's midfield general being squabbled over by Manchester United and Chelsea|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/tiemoue-bakayoko-meet-monacos-midfield-general-being-squabbled-over-manchester-united-and|website=FourFourTwo|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN_29Mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Ciaran|title=Monaco star could be as crucial to Manchester United as Antoine Griezmann|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-bakayoko-12808194|website=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=27 June 2017|date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being physically powerful and athletic.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt; He plays as a defensive midfielder in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]] of the pitch, breaking up attacks and making driving forward runs, with only [[Gabi (footballer)|Gabi]] and [[Danny Drinkwater]] breaking up more attacks during the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17 Champions League]].&lt;ref name="Sun_23June2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Jamie|title=Who is Tiemoue Bakayoko? £35million Chelsea target set to replace Nemanja Matic|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/2569337/tiemoue-bakayoko-monaco-midfielder-chelsea/|website=The Sun|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakayoko's manager at Monaco, [[Leonardo Jardim]], said: "He wins a lot of balls, brings balance to the team.

==Personal life==
Bakayoko is of Ivorian descent, and was approached by the [[Ivory Coast national football team|national team]] before he chose France in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/la-france-ou-la-cote-d-ivoire-bakayoko-a-hesite-jusqu-au-dernier-moment-selonson-frere-1130623.html|title=La France ou la Côte d'Ivoire ?

'''Kylian Hazard''' ({{IPA-fr|kiljan azaʁ}}; born 5 August 1995) is a Belgian [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] for [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]] on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He has two older brothers, [[Eden Hazard|Eden]] and [[Thorgan Hazard|Thorgan]], and one younger, [[Ethan Hazard|Ethan]], all of whom are footballers.

His father spent most of his career playing as a semi-professional with [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louvière]] in the [[Belgian Second Division]].&lt;ref name="kylian_leparisien"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/les-hazard-une-famille-de-foot-13-05-2011-1447493.php | title = Les Hazard, une famille de foot | date = 15 March 2011 | accessdate = 19 December 2011 |work=Le Parisien | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played mainly as a [[defensive midfielder]].&lt;ref name="kylian_leparisien"/&gt; His mother played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] in the [[Belgian Women's First Division]] and stopped playing when she was three months pregnant with her eldest son Eden Hazard.&lt;ref name="kylian_leparisien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kylian_family"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/LOSC/2010/01/29/article_avant-d-etre-partagee-entre-lille-et-len.shtml | title = Avant d'être partagée entre Lille et Lens, la famille Hazard a cultivé son jardin secret |date= 29 January 2010| accessdate = 19 April 2011 | publisher=La Voix des Sports | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing football, both parents became sports teachers.&lt;ref name="kylian_leparisien"/&gt; Thierry retired from his position in 2009 in order to devote more time to his children.&lt;ref name="kylian_leparisien"/&gt;

Kylian is the third of four children. His eldest brother [[Eden Hazard|Eden]] previously played for [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and now plays for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[Premier League]]. His other elder brother, [[Thorgan Hazard|Thorgan]], joined Eden at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2012, before moving to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in January 2015, and had previously progressed through the youth ranks of Lille's [[Derby du Nord|biggest rivals]] [[RC Lens|Lens]].&lt;ref name="Eden Hazard brother Thorgan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thorgan Hozard joins Chelsea |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2859608,00.html |work=[[Chelsea F.C.]] |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726143551/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10268~2859608%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eden_hazard"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html | title = Eden Hazard, protection rapprochée | date = 21 November 2008 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher = [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090501150142/http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html | archivedate = 1 May 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |title=Eden est entouré de professionnels |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=10 April 2010 |publisher=Foot Goal |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105084607/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |archivedate= 5 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |title=L'interview découverte de Thorgan Hazard |accessdate=10 March 2010 |publisher=Lensois |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313121407/http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |archivedate=13 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother Ethan currently plays in the youth academy of [[A.F.C.

Kylian and his three brothers were raised in a comfortable environment with their parents ensuring they had whatever they needed to excel.&lt;ref name="eden_hazard2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/hazard-lights-the-way-for-belgium | title = Hazard lights the way for Belgium |date= 5 March 2010 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived "no more than three meters" from a football training ground and the brothers often ventured onto a training pitch through a small hole in order to hone and develop their skills.&lt;ref name="kylian_family"/&gt;

Hazard began his professional career at [[R.

'''Victor Moses''' (born 12 December 1990) is a Nigerian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] on either flank for [[Süper Lig]] club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Moses began his career in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], before his performances caught the eye of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], where he made his [[Premier League]] debut in 2010. After two years, his game had improved to the extent that European champions Chelsea were interested, and he signed for them in the summer of 2012. Despite ten goals in all competitions during his first season, he spent his second season on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], his third on loan at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and his fourth on loan at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].

Born in Nigeria, Moses represented [[England national youth football team|England youth teams]] at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels, but opted to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] as opposed to being fully [[cap (sport)|cap]]ped for [[England national football team|England]]. He has gained over 35 caps for Nigeria since his debut in 2012 and played in their winning campaign at the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]], as well as the campaign in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early life and career===
Moses was born in [[Lagos]], Nigeria,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; the son of a Christian pastor. When he was 11, his parents were killed in [[Miss World riots|religious riots]] in [[Kaduna]] when rioters invaded their home. Moses was playing football in the street at the time. A week later, after being hidden by friends, his relatives paid for him to travel to the UK to claim asylum. He was placed with a foster family in South London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/14/victor-moses-interview-chelsea|title=Victor Moses: they should be proud of me, looking down being proud|last=Hytner|first=David|date=2012-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MosesAsylum"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kelso |first= Paul |date=20 May 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/20/football.immigration |title=14-year-old asylum seeker becomes school's football hero |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 July 2008 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent1"&gt;{{cite news|title=FA Cup: Orphaned Victor Moses feels very much at home with Chelsea|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/fa-cup-orphaned-victor-moses-feels-very-much-at-home-with-chelsea-8527874.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Harris Academy South Norwood|Stanley Technical High School]] (now known as the Harris Academy) in [[South Norwood]]. Scouted playing football in the local Tandridge League for Cosmos 90 FC, [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] approached him, with the club's [[Selhurst Park]] stadium just streets away from his school.&lt;ref name="Independent1"/&gt;

Offered a place in the Eagles' academy, Palace recommended him to the fee-paying [[Whitgift School]] in [[Croydon]], where former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] star [[Colin Pates]] was coaching the school football team.&lt;ref name="Independent1"/&gt; Moses first came to prominence at 14 after scoring 50 goals for Palace's under-14s side. Playing for three years at both Whitgift and Palace, Moses scored over 100 goals as well as helping Whitgift win many School Cups, including a National Cup where Moses scored all five goals in the final against [[Healing School]] of [[Grimsby]] at the [[Walkers Stadium]], Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking back at when Liverpool and Chelsea ace Victor Moses stunned Healing's dream team |url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Looking-Liverpool-Chelsea-ace-Victor-Moses/story-20471306-detail/story.html |website=Grimsby Telegraph |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112012838/http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Looking-Liverpool-Chelsea-ace-Victor-Moses/story-20471306-detail/story.html |archivedate=12 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
Moses made his first team debut for Palace at the age of 16 on 6 November 2007 in a 1–1 draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff 1–1 Crystal Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7076416.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place in the side thereafter and scored his first senior goal on 12 March 2008 in a 1–1 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Brom 1–1 Crystal Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7287966.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Moses played 16 times in [[2007–08 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2007–08]] as Palace reached the [[2008 Football League play-offs#Championship|Championship play-offs]] where they lost out to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol City v C Palace as it happened|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7399418.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he signed a new contract at Selhurst Park, much to delight of manager [[Neil Warnock]], who stated, "Victor signing is a huge coup for the club; I've told Victor he could go as high as he wants. He's improving every day and I am delighted that he has signed this deal as he is a player who will go from strength to strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moses signs four-year Palace deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7529661.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses score twice in 32 appearances in [[2008–09 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2008–09]] as Palace had a disappointing campaign, finishing in 15th position.&lt;ref name=sb0809&gt;{{Soccerbase season|47716|2008|name=Victor Moses|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2009–10 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2009–10]], Moses went on a run of six goals in eight matches but Palace were suffering huge financial problems and the club went into administration in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace deducted 10 points|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8484824.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wigan Athletic===
On the final day of January 2010, he completed a £2.5 million transfer to [[Premier League]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] after Palace went into administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = 31 January 2010| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/crystalpalace/7121319/Victor-Moses-joins-Wigan-Athletic-as-Crystal-Palace-fire-sale-begins.html| title = Victor Moses joins Wigan Athletic as Crystal Palace fire sale begins| newspaper = The Daily Telegraph| accessdate = 31 January 2010| location = London| first = Jonathan| last = Liew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his debut on 6 February 2010 as a substitute against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8493730.stm|title=Sunderland 1–1 Wigan|date=6 February 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 March 2010, Moses came on as a substitute against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and got his first assist for the club, setting up [[Hugo Rodallega]] for an injury time winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2001372,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612181312/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2001372,00.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |title=Victor-ious |publisher= Wigan Athletic FC|date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Wigan on 3 May 2010 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8649742.stm| title = Wigan 2–2 Hull| publisher= BBC Sport| date = 3 May 2010| accessdate = 3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses picked up two injuries at the start of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clicklancashire.com/my-click/my-real-life/127932-wigan-athletic-winger-victor-moses-wants-tottenham-hotspur-shot.html |title=Wigan Athletic winger Victor Moses wants Tottenham Hotspur shot |work=Click Lancashire |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202954/http://www.clicklancashire.com/my-click/my-real-life/127932-wigan-athletic-winger-victor-moses-wants-tottenham-hotspur-shot.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and found it difficult to make it back into the first-team due to increased competition for places. He scored his first league goal of the season on 13 November 2010 in a 1–0 win against West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/moses-and-nzogbia-lead-wigan-out-of-wilderness-2133596.html| title = Moses and N'Zogbia lead Wigan out of wilderness| date = 14 November 2010| accessdate = 16 November 2010| location = London| newspaper = The Independent| first = Darren| last = Witcoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of winger [[Charles N'Zogbia]], Moses became a regular starter for Wigan in the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]]. On 10 December 2011, he scored his first goal of the season against West Brom&amp;nbsp;– his first goal since scoring against the same team last season.

Moses made his full debut for Chelsea when he started the [[Football League Cup#Third round|League Cup]] game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and scored his first goal after 71 minutes in a game that finished 6–0 to the Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19632463 |title=Chelsea 6–0 Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses started his first [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group E|Champions League]] game against [[FC Nordsjælland|Nordsjælland]].

On 16 August 2014, Moses joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on loan for the [[2014–15 Stoke City F.C. season|2014–15]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moses moves to Stoke|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2014/08/moses-moves-to-stoke.html|website=Chelsea F.C|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut for Stoke City on 30 August in a 1–0 win away at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 0–1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28907276|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoke's 1–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 29 September, Moses provided the assist for the lone goal scored by [[Peter Crouch]] and was voted [[Man of the Match]] for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 1–0 Newcastle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29305924|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, in a 2–1 win against Swansea City, Moses won a penalty after going down under a challenge from [[Àngel Rangel]]; after the match, Swansea manager [[Garry Monk]] claimed that Moses dived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–1 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29586592|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swansea boss Garry Monk criticises 'cheat' Victor Moses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29682896|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Match of the Day 2]]'' pundit [[John Hartson]] also claimed Moses had cheated, but later apologised to Moses for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hartson apologises to Stoke's Victor Moses over 'cheat' claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29770009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses scored his first goal for Stoke on 1 November in a 2–2 draw with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–2 West Ham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29768017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a thigh injury against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 22 November which ruled him out for eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Moses: Stoke City striker faces eight weeks out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30210377|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2015, Moses returned to the starting line-up against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], which ended in a 1–0 win for Stoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leicester City vs Stoke City|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/17/england/premier-league/leicester-city-fc/stoke-city-fc/1703921/|website=Soccerway|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, Moses scored a 90th-minute penalty to earn Stoke a 2–1 victory over Midlands rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31466727|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored in a 2–0 victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 4 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–0 Everton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31616988|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[André Schürrle]] and [[Mohamed Salah]] leaving on a permanent basis and on loan, respectively, it was announced that Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] attempted to recall Moses back from Stoke mid-season, only for the winger to reject the move back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victor Moses rejected return to Chelsea|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11486800/Victor-Moses-rejected-return-to-Chelsea.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses suffered a hamstring injury whilst playing against West Ham on 11 April, which ruled him out for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Moses returns to Stamford Bridge with injury|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11535854/Chelsea-news-Victor-Moses-returns-to-Stamford-Bridge-with-injury.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season: Loan to West Ham United====

After a successful season on loan with Stoke, Moses returned to the Blues and made appearances in all four of the preseason games and scored once, against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Saint-Germain 1–1 Chelsea |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/live-commentary/live-commentary-psg-vs-chelsea_235428.html |date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses made his first competitive appearance since the return on 2 August 2015 against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for the [[2015 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] when he replaced [[John Terry]] in the 82nd minute. The match ended with Chelsea losing 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Community Shield: Arsenal vs Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/33500342 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was also included on the bench during the first game of the season against Swansea City, although he did not make an appearance as Chelsea drew 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/08/england/premier-league/chelsea-football-club/swansea-city-afc/2043051/ |title=Chelsea vs. Swansea City 2 – 2 (8/8/15) |date=8 August 2015 |publisher=Soccerway }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2015, Moses joined West Ham United on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Moses signs on loan |url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/September/1-September/Moses-signs-on-loan |publisher=West Ham United |date=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902153252/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/September/1-September/Moses-signs-on-loan |archivedate=2 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining West Ham United on loan, Moses signed a new four-year contract, which will keep him at Chelsea until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=New Deal for Moses |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/08/new-deal-for-moses.html |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses made his West Ham debut on 14 September in a 2–0 home win against Newcastle United, where he was named Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34171138 | title=West Ham 2–0 Newcastle United | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second game, on 19 September away against Manchester City, Moses scored his only West Ham goal, in a 1–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34191909 | title=Manchester City 1–2 West Ham | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, during the match against Manchester United, Moses suffered a hamstring injury that ruled him out until February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espnfc.us/west-ham-united/story/2744994/west-ham-forward-victor-moses-to-undergo-scan-on-hamstring | title=West Ham's Victor Moses to undergo scan on hamstring injury | publisher=ESPN | date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, it was revealed that the loan deal also had an option to make the move permanent at the end of the season, but West Ham decided to turn down the option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/10230070/west-ham-to-let-alex-song-victor-moses-and-emmanuel-emenike-leave-8211-sky-sources |title=West Ham to let Alex Song, Victor Moses and Emmanuel Emenike leave – Sky sources |date=4 April 2016 |publisher=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====

After impressing new manager [[Antonio Conte]] during preseason, Moses was included in the first-team squad. On 15 August 2016, Moses played his first league game for Chelsea in three years, coming off the bench for [[Eden Hazard]] against West Ham United in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37006707 |title=Chelsea 2–1 West Ham: Costa's late strike earns Conte's first Premier League win|date=15 August 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August, Moses made his first start and scored his first goal since his return, in the Second round of the [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chelsea 3–2 Bristol Rovers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37091061 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After back to back league defeats, Conte converted into a [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]] with Moses playing as a right-sided [[Rightwingback|wing-back]] in the following match against Hull City. His performance as a wing-back helped Chelsea to a 2–0 victory and also earned him the Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37459840 |title=Hull City 0–2 Chelsea |date=1 October 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2016, Moses scored his second league goal of the season against Leicester City in a 3–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37594219 |title=Chelsea 3–0 Leicester City|date=15 August 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2016, Moses scored the winner in a 2–1 victory against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was named the Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/chelsea-vs-tottenham/356457 |title=Chelsea 2–1 Tottenham Hotspur: Blues maintain hold of top spot| publisher=Sky Sports| date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses played 40 games in all competitions for Chelsea in the 2016–17 season, scoring four goals.&lt;ref name="sb1617" /&gt; With Chelsea winning the Premier League title, Moses became the Nigerian player with the most Premier League appearances for a title winning team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/sports/football/chelseas-victor-moses-is-a-premier-league-winner-id6670904.html|title=Chelsea"s Victor Moses is a Premier League winner|first=Steve|last=Dede|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2017, he played in the [[2017 FA Cup Final]] against Arsenal which Chelsea lost 2–1. Having been booked for a foul on [[Danny Welbeck]] earlier, he was given a second booking, resulting in a red card, after diving in the [[penalty area]]. He became the fifth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2017/05/28/fa-cup-final-victor-moses-joins-four-players-hall-shame/|title=FA Cup final: Victor Moses joins four other players in hall of shame|date=28 May 2017|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
Moses scored the opening goal in the [[2017 FA Community Shield]], which Chelsea lost to [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] Arsenal on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal lift Community Shield|date=6 August 2017|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=thefa.com|publisher=The Football Association|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/aug/04/fa-community-shield-arsenal-chelsea-report-060817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season: Loan to Fenerbahçe====
In January 2019, Moses signed an eighteen-month loan deal with Turkish side, Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46984393|title=Victor Moses: Chelsea winger completes Fenerbahce loan|date=25 January 2019|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2019, Moses scored his first league goal of the season for Fenerbahce in a 2-0 win against Goztepe S.K. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legit.ng/1219383-fenerbahce-2-0-goztepe-victor-moses-scores-turkish-league-goal.html|title=Fenerbahçe 2 - 0 Göztepe: Victor Moses scores first Turkish league goal Read more: https://www.legit.ng/1219383-fenerbahce-2-0-goztepe-victor-moses-scores-turkish-league-goal.html|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===England===
====U16 and U17 level====
Despite originally hailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Moses initially chose to represent his adopted home of [[England national football team|England]], featuring for the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16 team]], in which he won the [[Victory Shield]] in 2005, and [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] level. He travelled with the squad to the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2007 UEFA European U-17 Championship]] in Belgium, scoring three times (including the only goal in the semi-final win over [[France national under-17 football team|France]]) to help [[John Peacock (footballer)|John Peacock]]'s side to the competition final, where they were narrowly beaten by a single goal by [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]], though Moses managed to finish as the competition's top scorer and collect the Golden Boot for doing so.

That same summer, the squad travelled to [[South Korea]] for the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup|FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Moses finished as the Young Lions' top scorer, netting three times in the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup#Group B|Group B fixtures]], but sustained an injury in the victory over [[Brazil national under-17 football team|Brazil]] that ruled him out of the competition. Moses' teammates went on to reach the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup#Quarterfinals|quarterfinal stage]].

====U19s====
Following that tournament, Moses was promoted to the [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] squad, and following his goalscoring exploits for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]'s first-team, he was promoted to the [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] side without appearing sufficiently for the U-18s to actually collect a cap. He went with the U-19s to the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|2008 UEFA European U-19 Championship]] in the [[Czech Republic]], playing two matches and picking up one assist as the Young Lions failed to make it out of [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship#Group B|Group B]]. Speculation grew as manager [[Stuart Pearce]] snubbed him that Moses would return to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]—this move never materialised.

====U21s====
Moses was promoted to the under-21 squad at the beginning of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]] and made his debut against [[Uzbekistan national under-21 football team|Uzbekistan]] in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvUzbekistan/Teamsheets?p=ts&amp;mid=102750 |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20110402053009/http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvUzbekistan/Teamsheets?p=ts&amp;mid=102750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2011 |title=Teamsheets |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses was selected to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] in February 2011, but the friendly was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickoff.com/news/19690/shola-ameobi-victor-moses-get-nigeria-call.php Ameobi, Moses get Nigeria call]. kickoff.com. 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He then accepted a call-up in March 2011 for Nigeria's games against [[Ethiopia national football team|Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/9431866.stm |title=Victor Moses gets late Nigeria call |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was ruled out of those games because his application to [[FIFA]] to switch nationalities was not received in time.

For the second, Ethiopian goalkeeper [[Sisay Bancha]] was given his second booking in the events leading to the penalty and was sent off. Ethiopia had already used all three substitutes so their holding midfielder went in goal, and missed Moses' penalty. The game ended 2–0. Nigeria went on to win the tournament, their third such title. Moses started in the final and played the entire game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20970786|title=Nations Cup 2013: Nigeria pick six locally-based players|author=Oluwashina Okeleji|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Nigeria’s preliminary 30 man [[Nigeria national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]], where he got a crucial equalizer against Argentina, though, his side lost the game in the dying minutes to see Argentina through while Nigeria got eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? - Goal.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tournament, it was announced by Moses on 15 August that he has retired from playing for Nigeria at international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45200919|title=Victor Moses: Chelsea's Nigeria winger announces international retirement at 27|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
Palmer joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at the age of nine, and featured for the club for the majority of his youth career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3524622/Kasey-Palmer-impressed-Chelsea-21s-nutmegged-Phil-Jones-youngster-looking-force-way-Guus-Hiddink-s-team-plans.html|title=Kasey Palmer impressed for Chelsea U 21s, but who is the youngster?|website=Mail Online|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having represented his nation at youth level, Palmer attracted interest from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and made the move in March 2013. Due to their academy status, the Blues were able to sign Palmer for only a small compensation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2306844/Kasey-Palmer-cost-Chelsea-800-000-Charlton-move.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: New-signing Palmer could cost Chelsea £800k after move from Charlton|website=Mail Online|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making a handful of appearances for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-18s]] during the remainder of his inaugural season, Palmer became an influential figure in [[Adrian Viveash]]'s side for the 2013–14 while making sporadic appears from the bench for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-19s]] and [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-21s]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/development-squad/under-21s/u21-player-profiles/kasey-palmer.html|title=Kasey Palmer|website=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2016, after being supposedly 'frozen' out of the Vitesse starting eleven, Pantić stated his passion for a return to London: "I want to come back to Chelsea, just to train. Why am I in Vitesse if I am not good enough? I am [going] crazy! I've made no mistake. If I had a chance and blew it, I would keep quiet. Maybe in Vitesse they don't like us [[Serbia|Serbs]]: [[Nemanja Matić]] did not get a chance here either and [[Uroš Đurđević]] played 22 matches in a year and a half."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chelsea loanee Danilo Pantic angry with Vitesse impasse |url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2016/3/3/11150312/chelsea-loanee-danilo-pantic-angry-with-vitesse-impasse |publisher=David Pasztor (SB Nation) |date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Hajduk Split===
Born in [[Mainz]], Germany, Pašalić moved to Croatia at early age and started playing football at county club NK GOŠK Kaštel Gomilica before joining the [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]'s youth academy in 2006. A youth international, he first gained wider recognition in the 2011–12 season, scoring 17 goals for the under-17s, despite being a midfielder, and scoring the winner for the under-19s in a 3–2 success against [[NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac|Hrvatski Dragovoljac]], which secured the club's championship trophy.

During the pre-season, however, Pašalić was diagnosed with a [[staphylococcus]] infection, being sidelined for the first half of the [[2012–13 Prva HNL|2012–13 campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/108416/Novi-pocetak-Junak-titule-Hajdukovih-juniora-Mario-Pasalic-vraca-se-nakon-teske-bolesti.aspx|title=Hajdukovih juniora Mario Pašalić vraća se nakon teške bolesti|last=Duplančić|first=Blaž|date=5 January 2013|work=Dalmacija News|language=Croatian|accessdate=21 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108105325/http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/108416/Novi-pocetak-Junak-titule-Hajdukovih-juniora-Mario-Pasalic-vraca-se-nakon-teske-bolesti.aspx|archivedate=8 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first match as a professional on 14 April 2013 [[Substitute (association football)|replacing]] [[Ivan Vuković]] in the 90th minute of a 2–1 home success against [[HNK Cibalia|Cibalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportcom.hr/sport/nogomet/domaci-nogomet/maxtv-prva-liga/maxtv-prva-liga-hajduk-pobijedio-pogotkom-iz-zale%C4%91a-lokomotiva-postignula-pet-pogodaka-u-nastavku.html|title=Hajduk pobijedio pogotkom iz zaleđa, petarda lokosa|language=Croatian|publisher=SportCom|date=14 April 2013|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucas Domingues Piazon''' (born 20 January 1994) is a Brazilian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He is primarily a [[Forward (association football)|striker]], although he has also been deployed as a left [[Winger (association football)#Winger|winger]], as an [[attacking midfielder]] or in the hole behind the striker.

==Early life==
Piazon was born in [[São Paulo]], to António Carlos Piazon, a commercial representative, and Marizabel Domingues, a lawyer. He had a financially secure upbringing that allowed him to focus on both school and football at the same time. Both of Piazon's parents took an active role in his career. He grew up with his sister Juliana, who is three years younger than him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseaindia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=781&amp;start=0|title=Piazon sister|publisher=ChelseaIndia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116080351/http://www.chelseaindia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=781&amp;start=0|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] supporter from an early age, aspiring to play for them some day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pitacodogringo.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/interview-with-chelsea-signing-lucas-piazon-full-version/|title=Piazon Biography|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=pitacodogringo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/boy-from-brazil-set-for-life-at-chelsea-2672129.html|title=Brazilian to Stamford Bridge|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was young, Piazon's family moved to [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Piazon's football skills began to blossom at age eight. He developed an interest in [[futsal]] (indoor football) like other Brazilian footballers (such as [[Zico]] and [[Ronaldinho]]). He began playing for [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]]. At the age of 11, Piazon made the switch from [[Indoor soccer|indoor]] to the field.

==Club career==

===Youth career===
Piazon began his professional career with [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]]. He made an impression with them becoming top scorer in every youth tournament he appeared in. In 2007, he moved to neighbouring club, [[Clube Atlético Paranaense|Atlético Paranaense]]. He again turned out, as Atlético reached the finals of the U-15 Copa do Brasil in 2008, which they eventually lost to [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]. São Paulo became very impressed with his performance and made an offer. At the age of 14, Piazon left his family behind in Curitiba and joined São Paulo. In May, he began to attract the attention of international scouts when he helped guide São Paulo through the Brazilian qualifiers for the [[Manchester United Premier Cup|Premier Cup]] (Nike Cup). It was around this time that he was also called up by Brazil's U-15s. In August, São Paulo travelled to Manchester for the Premier Cup finals. In the Group stage, Piazon scored in the 3–0 win versus [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. São Paulo then went on to beat [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the final match.

===Chelsea===
In early 2011, Chelsea secured the services of Piazon by means of a pre-contract, having to fight off the interest from a number of the world's leading clubs, including Italian team [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/8568660/Brazils-best-young-footballers-no-long-available-on-the-cheap.html|title=Brazil's best young footballers no longer available on the cheap|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=8 July 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Jon|last=Cotterill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2011, São Paulo announced that Piazon could only play for the Chelsea senior team after 20 January 2012 when he became eligible to obtain a work visa, but he would join in the 2011 summer transfer window. Chelsea announced ten days later with Piazon passing a medical in London in early March 2011. It was reported that Chelsea paid in the region of [[Pound sterling|£]]5&amp;nbsp;million to acquire Piazon, which could rise to £10&amp;nbsp;million depending on several clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/15/chelsea-brazilian-teenager-lucas-piazon

I think my way of playing and my skills are more suited to the Premier League."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-starlet-im-not-kaka |title=Chelsea teenager Lucas Piazon rejects Kaka comparisons |publisher=Give Me Football |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piazon made his debut for the reserve team against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], thereafter saying, "I am able to play in the Youth Cup now." "Everybody knows I am here to play, so my main aims for the season are to play as many youth games as possible and hopefully feature in the reserves as well, and I want to win the Youth Cup." He also stated, "I am enjoying the company of [[Ramires]], [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]] and, of course, [[David Luiz]] is my best friend here. He is so funny and always joking so it's nice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2514375 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625123649/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2514375 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2014 |title=Youth Report: Chelsea 4 Fulham 2 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piazon scored his first reserve goal in an away victory against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], just before full-time with a solo effort, inside the box before firing it into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2552711 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625123644/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2552711 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2014 |title=RESERVE REPORT: ARSENAL 0 CHELSEA 4 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has scored twice in five games for the reserves and once in six for the youth team, most notably the winner in the [[FA Youth Cup]] tie against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-sign-up-brazilian-starlet |title=Chelsea sign up Brazilian starlet |publisher=Give Me Football |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He won the FA Youth Cup on 9 May 2012 against Blackburn, although failing to score in the match.

On 20 January 2012, his 18th birthday, Piazon obtained a [[work visa]] and became eligible to play for the Chelsea senior team. On 26 January 2012, he signed a contract extension that will keep him with the club until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2589434 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130425105748/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2589434 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 April 2013 |title=Piazon Signs Extension |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After impressing at Under-18 and Reserve level, Piazon was given the number 35 shirt, which was previously worn by [[Juliano Belletti]]. He was an unused substitute on the Chelsea bench, on 31 January 2012, in their 1–1 league draw against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/16695854.stm |title=Piazon makes bench |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 5 February 2012, in the 3–3 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16779082 |title=Chelsea v Man U |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Chelsea manager [[André Villas-Boas]] said, after the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] game, "He [Piazon] has trained more with the first team, which is very good for him. He's made great progress since arriving and in the last two games was on the bench. Unfortunately, he had no opportunity to enter, but has done a great job in the reserves team. He is a player that we have high hopes for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/avb-chelsea-have-high-hopes-lucas-piazon-2687411 |title=AVB: Chelsea have high hopes for Lucas Piazon |publisher= Tribal Football |accessdate= 2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2012, Piazon was named Chelsea Young Player of the Year in his first season. He was part of the side that won the FA Youth Cup Final 24 hours earlier. "I am very happy and I didn't expect this. It has been a fantastic week for me. David Luiz and Ramires have helped me a lot here as when I came in I was alone. I hope to be at Chelsea a long time and I will keep working." he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2767955 |location=London |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |title=Piazon pick up Chelsea award |date=25 June 2014 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, he was named on the bench on the final day of the season, in a home game against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] which Chelsea won 2–1, but was not involved in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973169 "Chelsea 2–1 Blackburn"] BBC Sport. 13 May 2012. Retrieved 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He told that he's looking forward to continuing his development and would like to make the breakthrough into the senior side, saying "I hope to be in the main group, train with them every day and if I have a chance to play some games." He went on to say that he's "always dreamed of playing for Chelsea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7884927/|title=Piazon living Chelsea dream|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
The pre-season prior to the start of the [[2012–13 Chelsea F.C. season|2012–13 season]], Piazon was given a chance to prove himself by Chelsea manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]] after being taken on tour in the United States, came on as a substitute in three of the four matches, making his senior debut in the 4–2 win over [[Seattle Sounders FC|Seattle Sounders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2853452/title/match-report-seattle-sounders-2-chelsea-4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119114156/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2853452/title/match-report-seattle-sounders-2-chelsea-4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=MATCH REPORT: SEATTLE SOUNDERS 2 CHELSEA 4 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in his second senior Chelsea appearance, the equaliser to earn Chelsea a 1–1 draw against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] at [[Yankee Stadium]]. Afterwards, he spoke of his delight: "It was good for me, it was special, to score in my second game", said the forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2857424/title/match-report-chelsea-1-paris-st-germain-1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119052844/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2857424/title/match-report-chelsea-1-paris-st-germain-1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=MATCH REPORT: CHELSEA 1 PARIS ST-GERMAIN 1 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2857441/title/piazon-a-special-feeling |title=PIAZON: A SPECIAL FEELING |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102182122/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2857441/title/piazon-a-special-feeling |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piazon came on in the 3–2 defeat to the MLS All-Stars in the [[2012 MLS All-Star Game]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2861129/title/match-report-mls-all-stars-3-chelsea-2 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119010819/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2861129/title/match-report-mls-all-stars-3-chelsea-2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=MATCH REPORT: MLS ALL-STARS 3 CHELSEA 2 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=26 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an unused substitute in the following fixture, with [[Fernando Torres]] taking his place in a 1–0 loss to [[A.C.

====Loan to Chievo====

In January 2019, he joined on loan [[A.C. ChievoVerona|ChievoVerona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chievoverona.it/en/highlights/news/official-lucas-piazon-giallobl%C3%B9|title=OFFICIAL: LUCAS PIAZON IS GIALLOBLÙ|publisher=A.C. ChievoVerona|date=31 January 2019|accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Piazon has represented Brazil at both under-15 and under-17 levels. At under-15 level, he helped his team to second place in the [[South American Under-15 Football Championship]] of [[2009 South American Under-15 Football Championship|2009]] in Bolivia, being the top goalscorer with ten goals.

At the under-17 level, during an international game for Brazil's U17 squad against Paraguay, Piazon scored an extraordinary goal when he kicked the ball with such force that it broke through the side netting of the goals, in a game which they went on to lose 2–1. In the [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup]], he scored in a 3–3 draw against the [[Ivory Coast national under-17 football team|Ivory Coast]].

==Style of play==
A tactical player, Piazon is known for his [[Dribbling|flair]], [[Passing (association football)|passing]], [[Shooting (association football)|powerful shooting]], [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]], [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s, reading of the game and [[Association football positions#Attacking|clinical finishing]]. Piazon commented on his playing style, "I'd say my playing style is different from typical Brazilian forwards. When you think about these, you think about dribbles and flashy moves. My football is simpler and more direct. It's more like a midfielder playing up front. I like to pass quickly. I don't hog the ball and I don't tend to run with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/8568660/Brazils-best-young-footballers-no-long-available-on-the-cheap.html |title=Piazon Style |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |location=London |first=Jon |last=Cotterill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media have often drawn comparisons between Piazon and Brazilian playmaker [[Kaká]], as the pair possess similar attributes and natural technical finesse. Piazon also somewhat resembles Kaká. However, Piazon has rejected comparisons saying: "I don't think [we are similar]", Piazon says of Kaká. "My style and his style are different because I am a [[Winger (soccer)|winger]], or a [[second striker]], and he is a [[Midfielder|central midfielder]]. He went on to say, "I don't think the comparison is because of our style. I think it is because we both played at São Paulo and maybe we can look similar on the pitch sometimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/24902_lucas_piazon___i_don_t_think_i_resemble_kaka_.html |title=Lucas Piazon: "I don't think I resemble Kaká" |publisher=Samba Foot |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-starlet-im-not-kaka |title=Chelsea starlet: I'm not Kaka |publisher=Give Me Football |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], [[Pennsylvania]], Pulisic began his professional career at Borussia Dortmund, where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, in which he featured in only 15 youth games, he was promoted to the senior team in 2016, at age 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Uersfeld |first=Stephan |date=January 5, 2016 |title=U.S. youngster Christian Pulisic trains with Borussia Dortmund first team |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/borussia-dortmund/story/2780485/us-christian-pulisic-trains-with-dortmund-first-team?src=com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured sparingly in his first season at the club, but his involvement increased dramatically in the following campaign, where he was a mainstay in the Dortmund team that won the [[2016–17 DFB-Pokal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USA's Pulisic a fast-rising talent at Dortmund|url = https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/01/21/christian-pulisic-usa-borussia-dortmund|website = www.si.com|access-date = January 26, 2016|first = Liviu|last = Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two seasons of first-team football at Borussia Dortmund, Pulisic moved to Chelsea in January 2019 in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth [[Euro|€]]64&amp;nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|$]]73&amp;nbsp;million/[[Pound sterling|£]]58&amp;nbsp;million), making him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive American player of all time]].

Pulisic holds several [[Bundesliga]] and Dortmund records; he is the youngest non-German to score in the league, the youngest player to score two Bundesliga goals, and is the youngest player to appear and score for Dortmund in the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Pulisic scores again to become youngest player ever with two Bundesliga goals|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/christian-pulisic-scores-again-to-become-youngest-player-ever-with-two-bundesliga-goals-042316|accessdate=April 23, 2016|publisher=Fox Sports|date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. international, Pulisic has scored 9 goals in 24 games for his country. He has appeared and scored at every [[United States Soccer Federation|youth level]], and made his senior debut in March 2016, at age 17. Later that year, Pulisic featured at the [[Copa América Centenario]], before he became the youngest person to appear and score in a [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup Qualifier]] for the United States. Pulisic has also featured as team captain; their youngest ever.

==Early life==
Pulisic was born in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], where he spent the majority of his childhood. His parents, [[Mark Pulisic|Mark]] and Kelley Pulisic, both played collegiate soccer at [[George Mason University]] and his father also played professional [[indoor soccer]] for the [[Harrisburg Heat (NPSL/MISL)|Harrisburg Heat]] in the 1990s and later became a coach at both youth and professional levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiY0Sk1G0g|title=Das American: Christian Pulisic's Spectacular Rise|first=|last=VICE Sports|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pulisic lived in England for a year at the age of seven, playing for the youth team of [[Brackley Town F.C.|Brackley Town]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; When his father was general manager of indoor club [[Detroit Ignition]] in the mid-2000s, Pulisic lived in Michigan and played for Michigan Rush. After the family returned to the Hershey area, Pulisic grew up playing for local [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] club PA Classics and occasionally training with local professional club Harrisburg City Islanders, now known as [[Penn FC]], during his teen years.

Pulisic's grandfather, Mate Pulišić, was born in Croatia on the island of [[Olib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/10920/1/Christian-Pulisic-rising-USA-soccer-star-in-Germany-has-Croatian-roots.html|title=Christian Pulisic rising USA soccer star in Germany has Croatian roots|website=www.croatia.org|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulisic applied for Croatian citizenship after moving to Germany (and the [[European Union]]) in order to avoid having to apply for a German work visa. He got an offer to play for the [[Croatia national football team|Croatia national team]], but declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pulisic nikada neće postati Pulišić|url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/sport/domaci-nogomet/clanak/id/307420/pulisic-nikada-nece-postati-pulisic|accessdate=November 11, 2016|publisher=Slobodna Dalmacija|language=Croatian|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulisic has a cousin, [[Will Pulisic]], who has also represented the United States at the under-17 level, as a goalkeeper, who also plays for Borussia Dortmund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. under-17 keeper Will Pulisic set to join cousin Christian at Dortmund|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/borussia-dortmund/story/2835198/us-u17-keeper-will-pulisic-set-to-join-cousin-at-dortmund|accessdate=April 18, 2016|publisher=ESPN FC|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Borussia Dortmund===

In February 2015, [[Borussia Dortmund]] signed 16-year-old Pulisic and assigned him first to their U17 squad and in Summer 2015 to the U19. After scoring 10 and assisting 8 in just 15 games with the Dortmund youth teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/01/31/who-us-international-christian-pulisic-and-how-did-he-make-borussia-dortmund-first|title=Who is US international Christian Pulisic, and how did he make the Borussia Dortmund first team at 17 years old?|work=MLSsoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulisic was called to join the first team over winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der nächste Schritt für Passlack und Pulisic|url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/642270/artikel_der-naechste-schritt-fuer-passlack-und-pulisic.html|website = kicker online|access-date = January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16: Breakthrough season====
In January 2016, while with the first team in the winter break, Pulisic played the second half of two friendly matches, scoring one goal and assisting another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christian Pulisic scores in Dortmund win|url = http://sbisoccer.com/2016/01/christian-pulisic-scores-in-dortmund-win|website = Soccer By Ives|access-date = January 26, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, a day after making his debut on the first team bench, Pulisic played 90 minutes in a friendly against [[1.

Pulisic made his first Bundesliga start on February 21, against Bayer Leverkusen before eventually being substituted for [[Marco Reus]]. He made his second Bundesliga start on April 10, against [[FC Schalke 04]] in the ''[[Revierderby]]'', playing 73 minutes before being replaced by [[İlkay Gündoğan]]. In response to Pulisic's performance against Schalke, team manager [[Thomas Tuchel]] said, "He's a teenager in his first year of professional football. His first two games in the starting eleven were in Leverkusen and here today in Schalke – not the easiest of tasks. It shows our huge appreciation that we see him as a full time player on our team. He was a valuable substitute against Werder Bremen and Liverpool. He has looked really good recently which has been proved today. It is completely normal that he could not have played with this pace and this intensity for over 90 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screamer.deadspin.com/christian-pulisic-is-more-than-just-the-next-hyped-savi-1770345385|title=Christian Pulisic, The Latest "Savior Of American Soccer," Is More Than Just Hype|last=Redford|first=Patrick|website=Screamer|language=en-US|access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulisic scored his first Bundesliga goal for Borussia Dortmund on April 17, opening the scoring in a 3–0 home win against [[Hamburger SV]]. It made him the youngest non-German and fourth-youngest player to score a goal in the Bundesliga, at just 17 years and 212 days old.&lt;ref name="youngest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/borussia-dortmund/story/2852892/christian-pulisic-youngest-non-german-to-score-in-bundesliga|title=Christian Pulisic becomes youngest non-German to score in Bundesliga|work=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his goal against [[VfB Stuttgart]] on April 23, Pulisic broke another Bundesliga scoring record by becoming the youngest player to score two goals in the top-flight league. The game also marked his first yellow card in the Bundesliga, as a result of a challenge on [[Emiliano Insúa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/christian-pulisic-scores-again-to-become-youngest-player-ever-with-two-bundesliga-goals-042316|title=Christian Pulisic scores again to become youngest player ever with 2 Bundesliga goals|work=FoxSports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His low center of gravity allows him to dribble at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faceoffootball.com/scout-report-on-christian-pulisic/|title=Scout Report on Christian Pulisic|first=|last=Shashi|date=March 28, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, he has played more of a winger role for Dortmund. His adept weak-foot skills allow him to play on either side of the field.

Because of his style of play Pulisic is known to be a subject of fouls by opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.'s Christian Pulisic 'not going to change' style in face of multiple fouls|url=http://www.espnfc.com/united-states/story/3221168/uss-christian-pulisic-not-going-to-change-style-in-face-of-multiple-fouls|first=Jeff|last=Carlisle|date=October 5, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans cry foul after Christian Pulisic takes a beating in World Cup qualifier against Panama|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/dynamo/article/Americans-cry-foul-after-Christian-Pulisic-takes-12261181.php|first=Ronald|last=Blum|date=October 7, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|work=Association Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Christian Pulisic Is So Good It Hurts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/sports/soccer/christian-pulisic-usmnt.html|first=Andrew|last=Das|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josimar Aldair Quintero Quintero''' ({{IPA-es|ɟʝosiˈmaɾ kinˈteɾo}}; born 3 February 1997) is an Ecuadorian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Lleida Esportiu]] on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Born in [[Guayaquil]], Quintero moved to Spain with his family at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chelsea set to sign Barcelona starlet Josimar Quintero: "The new Antonio Valencia" |url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/chelsea-set-to-sign-barcelona-starlet-josimar-quintero-dubbed-the-new-antonio-valencia/ |publisher=101 Great Goals |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined ''[[La Masia]]'', the youth academy of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], at the age of eight. In 2013, it was reported that [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] were interested in securing his services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the 'next Antonio Valencia' who has 'agreed' to swap Barcelona for Chelsea|url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2013/04/20/meet-the-next-antonio-valencia-who-has-agreed-to-swap-barcelona/|publisher=HITC|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Quintero opted to join English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Josimar Quintero|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/on-loan-players/josimar-quintero.html|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to paperwork and visa issues, Quintero was unable to play a competitive match for Chelsea until he turned 18.&lt;ref name="Josimar Quintero"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Josimar Quintero |url=http://thechels.info/wiki/Josimar_Quintero |publisher=TheChels.info |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014–15 under-21 campaign, Quintero became a key figure in [[Adrian Viveash]]'s starting eleven, featuring eighteen times and scoring once in all competitions.&lt;ref name="Josimar Quintero"/&gt; He scored his first goal for the Chelsea academy in an [[UEFA Youth League]] encounter against Portuguese club [[FC Porto|Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South American Chelsea prospect Josimar Quintero nets first goal since Barcelona exit|url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2015/09/29/south-american-chelsea-prospect-quintero-nets-first-goal-since-b/|publisher=HITC|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his debut season in England, Quintero transitioned from a winger to a central midfielder.

On 5 July 2017, following reports suggesting Quintero was ready to leave Chelsea, he joined Russian club [[FC Rostov|Rostov]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Loan move for Quintero |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/07/loan-move-for-quintero.html |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=5 July 2017 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2017, Quintero made his Rostov debut during their cup tie against [[FC Volgar Astrakhan|Volgar Astrakhan]], replacing [[Žan Majer]] in their 2–0 away victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Volgar Astrakhan vs. Rostov|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2017/09/20/russia/cup/volgar-gazprom-astrakhan/fk-rostov-na-donu/2582119/ |publisher=Soccerway |date=20 September 2017 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2018, Rostov removed Quintero from their official squad list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Russian Premier League]]|url=http://rfpl.org/players/Kintero-Kintero-Hosimar-Aldair|title=Quintero Russian League registration page|date=2 January 2018|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return from Rostov, Quintero joined Spanish club [[Betis Deportivo Balompié|Betis B]] in January 2018 on loan for the remainder of the campaign. The deal also included an option to purchase Quintero at the conclusion of the loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Josimar Quintero, third winter signing of Betis Deportivo |url=http://realbetisbalompie.es/es/noticias/cantera/10782/josimar-quintero-tercer-fichaje-invernal-del-betis |publisher=Betis Deportivo Official Site |date=17 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2018, he made his Betis B debut during their 3–1 away defeat against [[Mérida AD|Mérida]], replacing Jesús Pozo in the 79th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mérida AD vs. Real Betis II |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2018/03/04/spain/segunda-b/merida-ad/real-betis-ii/2540040/ |publisher=Soccerway |date=4 March 2018 |accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Despite being an [[England national youth football team|England youth international]], and having featured in non-competitive fixtures for the senior team, Abraham remains eligible to represent [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] through his paternal lineage and was in the past sounded out by the Nigerian Football Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Emmanuel |first=Ifeanyi (7 July 2016) |url=http://www.allnigeriasoccer.com/read_news.php?nid=19669 |title=Officials Hold Talks With Chelsea Striker Tammy Abraham, Dad Over Playing For Nigeria |website=All Nigeria Soccer |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham's father is close friends with [[Nigeria Football Federation]] President, [[Amaju Pinnick]] and on 21 September 2017, Pinnick claimed that Abraham had switched his allegiance to Nigeria.

===Youth===
Abraham has represented England at both [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] level.

On 6 July 2016, Abraham was one of four Chelsea players named in [[Aidy Boothroyd]]'s [[2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship squads#England|squad]] for the [[UEFA European Under-19 Championship|U19 European Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/jul/06/under-19s-euro-squad-named-060716 |title=England U19s squad named for Euros Challenge |publisher=The Football Association |last=Veevers |first=Nicholas |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in three out of four matches as England were eliminated by [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italy]] in the [[semi-final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/jul/21/italy-report-210716 |title=England U-19s' Euro dreams ended by Italy in semi-final |publisher=The Football Association |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham also received his first [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] call-up on 29 September 2016. He made his first appearance for the team on 6 October, coming on as a substitute with eight minutes remaining against [[Kazakhstan national under-21 football team|Kazakhstan]] in a qualifier for the U21 European Championships to help England to a 1–0 victory which secured the nation's progression to the tournament proper. He made his full debut for the U21s in their final group stage match against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and netted twice in a 5–0 victory for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/england-u21-vs-bosnia-and-herzegovina-u21/338970 |title=England U21s 5–0 Bosnia-Herzegovina U21s: Tammy Abraham nets brace in convincing win |publisher=Sky Sports |last=Yew |first=Oliver |date=11 October 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, he was named in the [[2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship squads#England|England squad]] for the [[2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/jun/05/england-u21s-euro-squad-selected-050617 |title=U21's Euros Squad Selected |publisher=The Football Association |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=20 June 2017 |last=Veevers |first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first, and only goal for the tournament in the semi-final against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]]. England ultimately lost the match after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], with Abraham one of the players who missed his spot-kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10934481/tammy-abraham-to-swansea-why-the-chelsea-striker-will-be-a-success |title=Tammy Abraham to Swansea: Why the Chelsea striker will be a success |publisher=Sky Sports |last=Bate |first=Adam |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2018, having been omitted from [[2018 FIFA World Cup squads#England|England's squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Abraham was recalled to the [[2018 Toulon Tournament squads#England|under-20 side]] for the [[Toulon Tournament]] in France where they had been drawn in a group alongside [[Qatar national under-20 football team|Qatar]], China and [[Mexico national under-20 football team|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44154538 |title=How I found out about my England call-up |publisher=BBC |date=17 May 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Football Association |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018 |title=England U21s head to Maurice Revello Tournament in Toulon with a 20-man squad |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/may/18/england-u21s-squad-named-for-toulon-180518}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, England opened their title defence with a 2–1 win over China in which Abraham scored the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tammy Abraham rescues England in Toulon opener |first=Matt |last=Reed |date=27 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |publisher=NBC Sports |url=https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2018/05/27/tammy-abraham-rescues-england-in-toulon-opener/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not feature in the subsequent match against Mexico but returned to score in a 4–0 win over Qatar which saw England qualify for the semi-finals where they were drawn against [[Scotland national under-20 football team|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toulon Tournament: England and Mexico play out draw in France |date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44297181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779012-england-fail-to-secure-automatic-toulon-qualification-despite-big-win-over-qatar |title=England Fail to Secure Automatic Toulon Qualification Despite Big Win over Qatar |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Jones |first=Matt |date=1 June 2018 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/06/05/england-u21-manager-says-semi-final-spot-toulon-tournament-minimum/ |title=England U21 manager says semi-final spot at Toulon Tournament is minimum target, but warns against complacency |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |last=Edwards |first=Luke |date=5 June 2018 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham was only used as a late substitute as England defeated Scotland but was selected to start in the final where they met Mexico. There he was unlucky not to score, hitting the post in the second half, but helped England claim their third successive title with a 2–1 win.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44426516 |title=Toulon Tournament: England U21s secure third successive title with 2–1 win over Mexico |publisher=BBC |last=O'Keefe |first=Greg |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
On 2 November 2017, Abraham was one of three uncapped players called up to the senior [[England national football team|England]] team for [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendlies]] against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwese.espn.com/football/england/story/3255581/joe-gomez-ruben-loftus-cheek-and-tammy-abraham-get-england-call-ups |title=Joe Gomez, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham get England call-ups |publisher=ESPN |date=2 November 2017 |accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England: Tammy Abraham, Joe Gomez &amp; Ruben Loftus-Cheek called up |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41848591 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 November 2017 |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against the former on 10 November, starting in a 0–0 draw at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 0–0 Germany |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41854505 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Abraham was born in [[Camberwell]], London.&lt;ref name=11v11/&gt; He has a younger brother, Timmy, who is also a footballer and plays in the academy system at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/05/25/fulham-sign-chelsea-striker-tammy-abrahams-brother-timmy |title=Timmy Abraham, brother of Chelsea foward &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Tammy |newspaper=HITC |location=London |last=Brown |first=Christian |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-stars-younger-brother-joins-13089934 |title=Chelsea star's younger brother joins Fulham after impressing on trial |website=Get West London |last=O'Donovan |first=Ryan |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Abraham was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on loan at Bristol City. At the time of the accident he was alleged to have been driving without a licence or insurance, and was summoned to court as a result. He later obtained his licence, passing the test in March of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/tammy-abraham-passes-driving-test-10765 |title=Tammy Abraham passes driving test two months after allegedly being caught without a licence |newspaper=Bristol Post |last=Ashcroft |first=Esme |date=20 March 2017 |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michy Batshuayi-Atunga''' ({{IPA-fr|mi(t)ʃi batʃu.a.(j)i}}; born 2 October 1993) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

He began his professional career at [[Standard Liège]] in 2011, scoring 44 goals in 120 games across all competitions. His 21 goals in the [[2013–14 Belgian Pro League]] made him the second-highest scorer and contributed to his [[Ebony Shoe Award]]. He then transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for £4.5&amp;nbsp;million, helping them reach the [[2016 Coupe de France Final]]. In July 2016, he was signed by Chelsea for £33&amp;nbsp;million, and scored the goal that won the [[List of English football champions|Premier League title]] in his [[2016–17 Premier League|debut season]].

Batshuayi scored in his international debut for Belgium against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] in March 2015. He was part of their side that reached the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and third place at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

In January 2019, Batshuayi's loan to Valencia was cut short and he joined English Premier League club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2019/february/michy-batshuayi-joins-palace-on-loan/|title=Michy Batshuayi Joins Palace on Loan|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47081617|title=Michy Batshuayi: Crystal Palace sign Chelsea striker on loan until end of season|work=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 2 February in a home 2–0 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], providing an assist for [[Jeffrey Schlupp]] to score the second goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benteke eager to become the new partner for 'Batman'|last=Collings|first=Simon|work=[[Evening Standard]]|location =London|date=4 February 2019|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February, Batshuayi scored his first goal for Crystal Palace in 4–1 win against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.in/football/report?gameId=513571|website=espn.in|title=Crystal Palace rout Leicester to step up pressure on Puel|date=23 February 2019|accessdate=5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:ENG-BEL (28).jpg|thumb|right|Batshuayi playing for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Batshuayi was eligible to play for the [[DR Congo national football team|DR Congo national team]] through his parents, but in March 2015, he ruled out this option, stating that although his Congolese heritage is important to him, he would rather represent [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/05/olympique-marseilles-michy-batshuayi-chooses-belgium-over-dr-congo/|title=Olympique Marseille’s Michy Batshuayi Chooses Belgium Over DR Congo|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Caught Offside|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batshuayi made his international debut for Belgium on 28 March 2015 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]]. Replacing [[Christian Benteke]] in the 77th minute, he scored from outside the penalty area three minutes later to seal a 5–0 victory at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scholten|first1=Berend|title=Classy Belgium too strong for Cyprus|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013931/postmatch/report/|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=UEFA|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] in France, making his competition debut in the last 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Toulouse]] on 26 June. With his first touch, he finished [[Eden Hazard]]'s assist for the second goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2016: Hungary 0 Belgium 4 – Alderweireld, Hazard, Batshuayi and Carrasco goals set up quarter-final against Wales|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/26/hungary-v-belgium-euro-2016-live/|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Batshuayi scored once in a 4–3 win away to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 7 October 2017, with the ''Red Devils'' already assured of their place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Vaishali|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina 3 Belgium 4: Vertonghen and Batshuayi on target as Fellaini forced off with knee injury|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/bosniaherzegovina-3-belgium-4-vertonghen-and-batshuayi-on-target-as-fellaini-forced-off-with-knee-a3653036.html|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=Evening Standard|date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Roberto Martínez]] named him in the 23-man squad to go to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Belgium include Vincent Kompany but Christian Benteke misses out |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44353673 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their second group stage match, he came on as a 68th-minute substitute against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and missed several chances before finally scoring the fifth goal for Belgium in a 5–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Massart |first1=Simon |title=Batshuayi's perseverance pays dividends |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/batshuayi-perseverance-pays-dividends-2966457 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=FIFA |date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A December 2015 profiling by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' likened Batshuayi for his speed, strength, positioning and link-up play to [[Didier Drogba]], despite being shorter than the Ivorian.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

==Personal life==
Batshuayi is nicknamed "Batsman", a play on the name of the superhero [[Batman]].&lt;ref name=batsman/&gt; His younger brother [[Aaron Leya Iseka]] plays for Toulouse in the same position, coming through at Anderlecht and signing for Marseille on loan, one month after Batshuayi's exit.&lt;ref name=bfm&gt;{{cite news |title=OM : cinq choses à savoir sur Aaron Leya Iseka, le petit frère de Michy Batshuayi|trans-title=OM: five things to know about Aaron Leya Iseka, Michy Batshuayi's little brother |url=https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/om-cinq-choses-a-savoir-sur-aaron-leya-iseka-le-petit-frere-de-michy-1030312.html |accessdate=11 August 2018 |publisher=BFM |date=27 August 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2010, Morata made his debut for the first team when he was brought on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Ángel Di María]] in the 88th minute of a 3–1 [[La Liga]] win at [[Real Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=301855&amp;cc=5739|title=Madrid claim Zaragoza triumph|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=12 December 2010|accessdate=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026102610/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=301855&amp;cc=5739|archivedate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later he made his first appearance in the [[Copa del Rey]], again coming off the bench in the last few minutes.

===Senior===
On 7 November 2014, Morata was called up to manager [[Vicente del Bosque]]'s [[Spain national football team|senior squad]] for matches against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/07/diego-costa-spain-squad-chelsea-left-out|title=Chelsea's Diego Costa left out of Spain squad to play Belarus and Germany|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against Belarus on the 15th, replacing [[Isco]] for the last ten minutes of a 3–0 win in [[Huelva]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013917/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Much-changed Spain dominate Belarus|publisher=UEFA|first=Graham|last=Hunter|date=15 November 2014|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same competition, on 27 March 2015, he scored his first senior international goal, the only goal in a victory over [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013920/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Morata ensures Spain beat Ukraine|publisher=UEFA|first=Graham|last=Hunter|date=27 March 2015|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected for the finals in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2016/05/31/actualidad/1464710610_277737.html?rel=cx_articulo|title=Isco y Saúl fuera de la lista de Del Bosque para la Eurocopa 2016|trans-title=Isco and Saúl out of Del Bosque's list for 2016 European Championship|newspaper=[[El País]]|location=Madrid|first=Luis|last=Martín|language=es|date=1 June 2016|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morata started and scored a brace in a 3–0 group win against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/report?gameId=438184|title=Spain cruise past Turkey to advance to knockout stage|publisher=ESPN FC|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2017, coming off the bench in the 77th minute, he scored once to help the hosts defeat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 3–0 in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/03/alvaro-morata-displays-sublime-pace-and-movement-to-finish-off-spain-goal-against-italy-6899406/|title=Watching, Conte? Morata shows UNREAL pace and movement to finish off Spain goal|newspaper=Metro|date=3 September 2017|access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2018, Morata was left out of Spain's World Cup finals squad after a poor club season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/21/chelsea-forward-alvaro-morata-out-spain-world-cup-squad|title=Chelsea forward Álvaro Morata left out of Spain’s World Cup squad|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 May 2018|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
In his youth, Morata was compared to Real Madrid and Spain's [[Fernando Morientes]] due to his playing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2010/12/13/deportes/1292194807_850215.html|title=Morata, el recogepelotas atlético que admiraba a Raúl|trans-title=Morata, the Atlético ball boy who admired Raúl|newspaper=El País|location=Madrid|first=Eleonora|last=Giovio|language=es|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first season at Juventus he stood out for his pace, energy, physicality and work-rate on the pitch, while his technique, opportunism, heading ability and positional sense saw him score several crucial goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/62304/case-morata|title=The case for Morata|publisher=Football Italia|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/alvaro-morata-uefa-champions-league-final-juventus-barcelona/|title=Morata an unsung hero for Juventus this season|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|first=Craig|last=Battle|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.sky.it/sport/champions_league/2015/06/06/juventus_barcellona_finale_champions_league_berlino.html|title=Triplete Barcellona: E' campione d'Europa.

A versatile and well-rounded forward, Morata is capable of playing as a main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] or linking up play between the lines, and has also played out wide on [[Midfielder#Winger|the wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/news/882679|title=Alvaro Morata denies contact with Real Madrid despite looming buy-back clause|publisher=The Score|first=Anthony|last=Lopopolo|date=15 November 2015|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an accurate penalty taker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2016/meet-the-history-makers-.php|title=Meet the history makers|publisher=Juventus F.C|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 2014, Morata shaved off all of his hair in solidarity with sick children, saying "kids with cancer wanted to have my haircut but they couldn't, so I gave myself theirs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deportes.terra.es/real-madrid/alvaro-morata-se-corta-el-pelo-por-un-fin-solidario,b9d6492350715410VgnVCM10000098cceb0aRCRD.html|title=Álvaro Morata se corta el pelo por un fin solidario|trans-title=Álvaro Morata cuts his hair in the aim of solidarity|publisher=Terra|language=es|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/deportes/noticia/alvaro-morata-rapa-cabeza-solidaridad-ninos-enfermos-cancer-2099971/0/#xtor=AD-15&amp;xts=467263|title=Álvaro Morata se rapa la cabeza por solidaridad con los niños enfermos de cáncer|trans-title=Álvaro Morata shaves his head in solidarity with children ill with cancer|newspaper=20 minutos|location=Madrid|language=es|date=30 March 2014|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2016, he got engaged to his Italian girlfriend Alice Campello,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2016/12/09/584b2a06ca4741d2728b45b8.html|title=Morata proposes to girlfriend during a magic show|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|first=Pablo|last=Moreno|date=10 December 2016|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 June 2017, the pair were married in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/alvaro-morata-marries-alice-campello-10642164|title=Alvaro Morata marries Alice Campello in stunning Venice ceremony as striker considers Manchester United move|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|first=Martin|last=Domin|date=18 June 2017|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two welcomed twin sons Alessandro and Leonardo on 29 July 2018, and the player changed his kit number at Chelsea from 9 to 29 to honour them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2018/8/3/new-dad-morata-to-wear-29|title=New dad Morata to wear 29|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=3 August 2018|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
