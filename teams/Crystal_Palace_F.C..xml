'''Crystal Palace Football Club''' is an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Selhurst]], [[South London]], that competes in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. They were founded in 1905 at the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building and played their home games at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. The club were forced to leave the Palace in 1915 due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], and played at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]] and [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] until 1924, when they moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]]. 

Palace have had several periods competing in the top level of English football. They enjoyed a successful period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during which the club achieved its highest ever league finish of third place in the top division in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]], and were only denied a place in Europe because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club were also one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace have been [[FA Cup]] finalists twice, finishing runners-up to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in both [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. The club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE UNLIKELY RIVALRY BETWEEN BRIGHTON AND CRYSTAL PALACE |url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2017/8/7/the-unlikely-rivalry-between-brighton-and-crystal-palace |publisher=In Bed With Maradona |date=7 August 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904195219/http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2017/8/7/the-unlikely-rivalry-between-brighton-and-crystal-palace |archive-date=4 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

==History==
{{main article|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}

[[File:Crystal Palace Year Book 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|alt=Front cover of a year book.|right|The Crystal Palace F.C. Year Book for 1912–13]]

In 1895, the Football Association had found a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] at the site of the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own football team to play at the Palace stadium. There had been an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team as early as 1861, but they had disappeared from historical records around 1876. The owners of the venue wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club. 

Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed "The Glaziers", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=3 June 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Unfortunately for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted and the club found itself in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division for the [[1905–06 Southern Football League|1905–06]] season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the First Division, crowned as champions.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runners-up to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to [[New Brompton F.C.|New Brompton]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the [[Newcastle United F.C. 0–1 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1907 shock First Round victory]] over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name=TOON&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Roger|title=The Toon: A Complete History of Newcastle United Football Club|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-78057-314-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJsZeq7myAC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=newcastle+crystal+palace+1907&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W0Zojga18D&amp;sig=yAD9saB6DPx6xumFSbUn2DRsPyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WtzCUZuvAsLP0QX2lIHoBg&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter |first=Steve |title=All time greatest F A cup giant killings Number 11 Newcastle United 0–1 Crystal Palace |url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm |work=The Giant Killers |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080520/http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm |archivedate= 8 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[First World War]] led to the [[Admiralty]] requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of West Norwood F.C. at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; Three years later they moved again to [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] due to the folding of [[Croydon Common F.C.]]. The club joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21 season]], finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League|Wartime Leagues]], the South Regional League and the South 'D' League. After the war, the club were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]]. The club remained in Division Three South until [[1957–58 in English football|1957–58]]. A league reorganisation would see clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. New chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed [[Arthur Rowe]] as manager, and the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61]] season saw Palace gain promotion. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in a friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had played a match in London. Although Rowe then stepped down for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963–64 in English football|1963–64]] and [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20, 32–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, but then experienced great disappointment. Under the management of [[Malcolm Allison]] the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club became nicknamed "The Eagles" and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the [[1975-76 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 1975–76 campaign, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]] and again in [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79]], the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions. That team from 1979 was dubbed "The team of the Eighties" and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season, before financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break up of that talented side, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain their position in the top flight. They were relegated from the First Division in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]] takeover of the club.

On 4 June 1984, former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3–3 with Manchester United in the first match but losing the replay 1–0. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4–1 ([[extra time|after extra time]]) in the final.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992–93.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.&amp;nbsp;39–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994–95.]]
The club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. Steve Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which [[Eric Cantona]] was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cantona affair: Palace offer Frenchman no sympathy |first=Martin |last=Whitfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6fPYXhX?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retaliated with a flying kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soccer star attacks a fan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DUNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=crystal%20palace&amp;pg=1390%2C6363284|date=27 January 1995|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=The Gainesville Sun|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jail term may make Cantona quit UK |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |first=Steve |last=Boggan |date=24 March 1995 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |work=The Independent |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6fW0Cet?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced to 120 hours [[community service]] on appeal.

Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of [[Ray Lewington]] and latterly [[Dave Bassett]]'s managership Palace reached the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]]. Palace lost the [[1996 Football League First Division play-off Final|1996 play-off final]] in dramatic fashion, [[Steve Claridge]] scoring a last minute goal for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to win the tie 2–1. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in early 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bassett quits Palace and joins Forest|agency=Reuters|work=The Nation|location=Bangkok|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKZNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s0MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bassett%20nottingham%20forest%20manager&amp;pg=6362%2C145781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when they defeated [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the final at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–2&lt;/ref&gt;

This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true [[yo-yo club]] fashion Palace were relegated back to the First Division for the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season. The club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

==Colours and crest==
When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.&lt;ref name=GNTSOTB&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicking the shirts off their backs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 November 2005 |author=Georgina Turner |author2=James Dart |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhJ9PvUd?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RG1&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Palace's colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938. The 1937–38 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but in 1938 they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace|work=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906064705/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm|archive-date=6 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|alt=Mono photograph of the front of the Palace and some of its surrounding grounds.|[[The Crystal Palace]], the façade of which appears on the club crest.]]
There were variations on this theme until 1963 when the club adopted the away strip of yellow jersey as the home colours. In 1964 the club adopted an all-white strip modelled on [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] whom the club had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until [[Malcolm Allison]]'s arrival as manager in 1973.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=GNTSOTB/&gt; Palace have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt;

The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of [[The Crystal Palace]] did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts in 1967–72. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the club's initials and nickname "the Glaziers" before Allison changed this too.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; The nickname became "the Eagles", inspired by Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace façade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott |first=Ken |title=Facelift for Crystal Palace's 'Benfica eagle' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=27 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhI4xKrQ?url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and although updated in 1996 and again in 2013, the crest retains these features.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; Since mid-2010, the club has made use of an [[American bald eagle]], called Kayla, as the club [[mascot]], with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/crystal_palace_eagles_will_be_flying_high_with_new_mascot_1_634203|title=Crystal Palace Eagles will be flying high with new mascot|date=8 September 2010|work=Bromley Times|publisher=Archant Community Media|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502043130/http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/crystal_palace_eagles_will_be_flying_high_with_new_mascot_1_634203|archive-date=2 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.howzit.msn.com/kayla-the-next-breed-of-mascot?page=12|title=Kayla – The Next Breed of Mascot|date=12 December 2013|work=Howzit MSN Sport|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502043514/http://sports.howzit.msn.com/kayla-the-next-breed-of-mascot?page=12|archive-date=2 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
{{Main article|Selhurst Park}}
In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area.

The Arthur Wait stand became all seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was redeveloped, replaced with a two tier Stand. Selhurst's attendance record was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482.&lt;ref&gt;King p.&amp;nbsp;67–71&lt;/ref&gt; After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the [[Taylor Report]], the ground's current capacity is 26,309.&lt;ref name=ESSPSF40&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Simon |title=Crystal Palace: Selhurst Park set for a 40,000 makeover |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-selhurst-park-set-for-a-40000-makeover-8635930.html |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=29 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhChOXHm?url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-selhurst-park-set-for-a-40000-makeover-8635930.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals were put forward to move the club back to the Crystal Palace National Stadium in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace unveil plans for National Sports Centre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/9364649.stm |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhCvqSHI?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/9364649.stm |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the club gained promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2013 there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping their current home into a 40,000 seater stadium.&lt;ref name=ESSPSF40/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCLUX/&gt;

==Support base==
[[File:HOLMSDALE_FANATICS.jpg|thumb|The Holmesdale Fanatics passionate home support.]]
Crystal Palace have a fan base predominantly from the local area which draws on [[South London]], [[Kent]], and [[Surrey]]. Their original home, at The Crystal Palace, was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the [[London Government Act 1963]] saw [[Greater London]] encompass [[Croydon]]. The club's passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the Holmesdale Fanatics have been based since 2005.

The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters' Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/ |work=Palace Independent Supporters Association |accessdate=27 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hh2BgmdZ?url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000. The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building "a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do |url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/ |work=Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust |accessdate=27 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hh25IwjO?url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[fanzines]] have been produced by the fans over the years. ''Eagle Eye'' launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement ''Palace Echo'' in 1995, running until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Palace Echo |url=http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104121826/http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Eastern Eagles'', ''So Glad You're Mine'' and ''One More Point'' were also published by fans in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Football Fanzines For Sale – (Part 2 – Clubs From C – D) | url=http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | accessdate=15 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528030035/http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | archive-date=28 May 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''One More Point'' ceased publication, ''Five Year Plan'' launched in its place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About FYP |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719170204/http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains an online presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ |title=Five Year Plan |accessdate=15 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720030445/http://fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ |archive-date=20 July 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters also congregate on two [[internet forum]]s, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |title=Crystal Palace F.C.Fans' Charter Season 2012/13 |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2012 |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201223/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base. The Foundation's work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do |url=http://cpfcfoundation.org/what-we-do/ |work=Crystal Palace F.C.

The club also maintains a sizeable celebrity support. The Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] has been an avid supporter of the club all his life. [[Kevin Day]] and [[Jo Brand]] host an annual comedy night for [[Comic Relief]] and the Palace Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloss |first=Andrew |title=Tickets still on sale for Crystal Palace comedy night |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/leisure/leisurenews/10453140.Tickets_still_on_sale_for_Crystal_Palace_comedy_night/ |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Croydon Guardian |date=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhFXSCvg?url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/leisure/leisurenews/10453140.Tickets_still_on_sale_for_Crystal_Palace_comedy_night/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the club also count fellow comedians [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Harry Enfield]], [[Mark Steel]], [[Jim Piddock]], and [[Roy Hudd]] amongst their fans.

==Rivalries==
{{See also|M23 derby|South London derby}}

Due to their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across [[South London derby|South London]]. They enjoy rivalries with both [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and former tenants [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. They have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] which did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976–77 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 1–0 and a fierce rivalry was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burnton |first=Simon |title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry |accessdate=26 June 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hfnuq6Kd?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry |archivedate=26 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
[[File:Sydney Bourne and Edmund Goodman circa 1906.jpg|right|alt=Low resolution monochrome photo of two men.|thumb|First chairman [[Sydney Bourne]] with [[Edmund Goodman]], 1906.]]
Due to the [[Football Association]] not wishing the owners of the FA Cup Final venue to also possess their own football team, a separate company was established to form and own the club. The first chairman, [[Sydney Bourne]], was found by club secretary [[Edmund Goodman]] after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Local businessman [[Arthur Wait]] established a consortium of seven other businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and they initially rotated the chairmanship.&lt;ref name="CA1"&gt;{{cite news | title=Behind-The-Scenes Shuffle at Palace | work=Croydon Advertiser | date=August 1972 | author=Matthews, John|quote="...&amp;nbsp;whose board he joined in 1948"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CA3&gt;"New Man Bloye Kills 'Moneybags' Tag", ''Croydon Advertiser'', 27 October 1972, p.58 "Twenty two years ago&amp;nbsp;... seven men formed a board&amp;nbsp;...

''Times'' [London, England] 27 October 1972: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloye's ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer [[Ron Noades]] and his small consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to [[Mark Goldberg]] on 5 June 1998, becoming the second longest serving chairman behind Sydney Bourne. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and the club entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group, the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire [[Simon Jordan]] negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, and it was not until June of that year that a takeover was completed by a consortium of four wealthy fans known as CPFC 2010.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–60&lt;/ref&gt;

CPFC 2010 was established by a consortium of four businessmen, [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]], [[Martin Long (businessman)|Martin Long]], Stephen Browett and [[Jeremy Hosking]] in 2010, with each owning a 25% share of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moody |first=Graham |title=Crystal Palace post £5m loss |url=http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/sport/9572656.Crystal_Palace_post___5m_loss/ |accessdate=1 June 2013 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=6 March 2012 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6jcxFEQ?url=http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/sport/9572656.Crystal_Palace_post___5m_loss/ |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Certificate of Incorporation|date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four successfully negotiated a take-over with the administrator Brendan Guilfoyle and a [[company voluntary arrangement]] was formally accepted by company creditors on 20 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace come out of administration |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8930854.stm |accessdate=27 June 2013 |date=20 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhBcbNh4?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8930854.stm |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPFC 2010 also purchased the ground from [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] after a demonstration by fans put pressure on the bank to agree terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace fans stage demonstration against Lloyds Bank as deadline looms |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/01/crystal-palace-lloyds-bank-demonstration |accessdate=27 June 2013 |date=1 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhB5YDm3?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/01/crystal-palace-lloyds-bank-demonstration |archivedate=27 June 2013 |agency=Press Association |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title=Crystal Palace granted reprieve after principle agreement over sale of club and ground |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/7794816/Crystal-Palace-granted-reprieve-after-principle-agreement-over-sale-of-club-and-ground.html |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhBIKjfA?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/7794816/Crystal-Palace-granted-reprieve-after-principle-agreement-over-sale-of-club-and-ground.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2015, it was announced that a new deal had been signed with American investors [[Joshua Harris (businessman)|Josh Harris]] and [[David S.

Later company accounts showed that the ownership figures were: Steve Parish 18%, Steve Browett 5%, Jeremy Hosking 5% and Martin Long 2.5% with the remainder being owned by Palace Holdco LP (a limited partnership registered in Delaware) 67.5% and Palace Parallel LLC (a company also registered in Delaware) 1.5%. Both Palace Holdco and Palace Parallel have 180 preference shares each. As the Delaware companies do not have to reveal their owners the exact ownership of the club is therefore unknown but Steve Parish confirmed that each of Harris and Blitzer had an 18% share to match his own.

[[File:CrystalPalaceFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing Crystal Palace's table positions since joining the Football League.]]Palace were inaugural champions of the newly formed [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21]], which was also their first ever season in the Football League and so became one of only a small group of clubs to have achieved the feat of winning a Football League Division at the first time of asking. Their average league attendance of 19,092 in the [[1960–61 Football League|1960–61]] season and the attendance of 37,774 for the [[Good Friday]] game at [[Selhurst Park]] between Palace and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] the same season are [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] attendance records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm | title=Division Four 1960/61 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm | archive-date=3 June 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace's record home attendance is 51,482 for a Division Two match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 11 May 1979.&lt;ref name=K444/&gt; With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. The club's widest victory margin in the league was their 9–0 win against [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]] in the Fourth Division in 1959, while their heaviest defeat in the league was by the same scoreline, 9–0, against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 1989 in Division One.&lt;ref name=K444&gt;King, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest transfer fee received for a Palace player is £25 million, from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for [[Yannick Bolasie]] in August 2016, while the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date was for [[Christian Benteke]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] also in August 2016, for £32&amp;nbsp;million. 

The club's highest ever league finish so far is third place in the [[Football League First Division]], which is now called the [[Premier League]], achieved in the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]] season. Palace hold the record for the most points for a relegated Premier League club, with 49 points (although that was in a 42-game season in [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]]).&lt;ref name=relegation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy/2018/aug/24/premier-league-40-point-mark-relegation-crystal-palace |title=Premier League managers should forget the mythical 40-point mark |last=Foster |first=Richard |date=24 August 2018 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |access-date=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished fourth from bottom, as it had been decided that at the end of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season, the bottom four clubs would be relegated in order to accommodate the league being reduced in size from 22 to 20 clubs for the [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96 season]]; Palace's points total that season of 45 is also the second-highest points total in Premier League history for a relegated club.&lt;ref name=relegation /&gt; Palace hold the record for the most Play-off final wins (4) resulting in promotion to the top flight. Each of these play-off final victories occurred at a different location: Selhurst Park in 1989 (the first leg of the two-legged final was played at [[Ewood Park]] in [[Blackburn]]), [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]] in 1997, [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] in 2004, and [[Wembley Stadium|new Wembley]] in 2013.
