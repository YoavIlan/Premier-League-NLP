'''Newcastle United Football Club''' is an English professional [[association football]] club based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football. Newcastle United was founded in 1892 by the merger of [[Newcastle East End F.C.|Newcastle East End]] and [[Newcastle West End F.C.|Newcastle West End]], and has played at its current home ground, [[St James' Park]], ever since. The ground was developed into an [[all-seater stadium]] in the mid-1990s and has a capacity of 52,354.&lt;ref name="premierleague.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/content/dam/premierleague/site-content/News/publications/handbooks/premier-league-handbook-2013-14.pdf |title=Premier League Handbook Season 2013/14 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 August 2013 |work=[[Premier League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122060849/http://www.premierleague.com/content/dam/premierleague/site-content/News/publications/handbooks/premier-league-handbook-2013-14.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 85 seasons in the top tier as of May 2016, and has never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the [[Football League]] in 1893. They have won four [[List of English football champions|League Championship]] titles, six [[FA Cup]]s and a [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], as well as the [[1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] and the [[2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of trophies won by an English club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/02/englands-ten-most-successful-clubs-chelsea-still-way-behind-arsenal-liverpool-man-united-despite-capital-one-cup-win/|title=England's Ten Most Successful Clubs: Chelsea Still Way Behind Arsenal, Liverpool &amp; Man United Despite Capital One Cup Win|first=Mark|last=Brus|date=2 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club were highly successful in the Premier League in the 1990s and early 2000s without winning any trophies, but have been mostly struggling since the 2006–07 season, and were relegated in 2009 and 2016. They returned to the Premier League for the [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18 season]] after winning the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] title the preceding year.

Newcastle has a fierce local rivalry with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and the two clubs have engaged in the [[Tyne–Wear derby]] since 1898. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their traditional crest takes elements of the city [[coat of arms]], which features two grey seahorses. Prior to each home game the team enters the field to "[[Local Hero (album)|Local Hero]]", written by Newcastle native [[Mark Knopfler]], while "[[Blaydon Races]]" is invariably sung during games.&lt;ref name="Hero"&gt;Anthony Bateman (2008). "Sporting Sounds: Relationships Between Sport and Music". p. 186. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has been owned by [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] since 2007, succeeding long term chairman and owner [[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]]. The club is the [[Deloitte Football Money League|17th]]-highest revenue producing club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating [[Euro|€]]169.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2015. Historically, Newcastle's highest placing was in 1999, when they were the fifth-highest revenue producing football club in the world, and second in England only behind [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref name =Del1999&gt;{{cite news| title = Man Utd 'Richest club in the world'| quote = The next British side on the list, at fifth, is Newcastle United... | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 1 December 1999 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/543805.stm | accessdate = 11 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Newcastle United FC League Performance.svg|thumb|A chart showing the progress of Newcastle United Football Club from its entry into the League in 1894 to the present. Newcastle have won the league on four occasions.]]

The first record of football being played on [[Tyneside]] dates from 3 March 1877 at [[Northern Football Club|Elswick Rugby Club]]. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the ''Stanley Cricket Club'' of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed ''[[Newcastle East End F.C.]]'' in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, ''[[Newcastle West End F.C.]]'' formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].&lt;ref name=formation&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs became rivals in the [[Northern Football League (England)|Northern League]]. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the other hand, Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a take over. Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;

With only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the [[The Football League|Football League's]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] at the start of the [[1892–93 in English football|1892–93]] season, they were invited to play in their new [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating "gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling".&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt; Suggested names included Newcastle F.C., Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but ''Newcastle United'' was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon |last=Turnbull |title=Football: Only one United? Why we are united in our disgust |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990516/ai_n14232962 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118070423/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990516/ai_n14232962 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 January 2008 |work=The Independent |date=16 May 1999 |accessdate=8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; At the start of the [[1893–94 in English football|1893–94]] season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=formation /&gt; They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2–2.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Turnstile numbers were still low, and the incensed club published a statement stating, "The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned". However, eventually figures picked up by [[1895–96 in English football|1895–96]], when 14,000 fans watched the team play [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. That season [[Frank Watt (football manager)|Frank Watt]] became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–99]] season. However, they lost their first game 4–2 at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and finished their first season in thirteenth place.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[File:FACupFinal1905NewcastleVilla.jpg|thumb|right|Harry Hampton scores one of his two goals in the 1905 FA Cup final against Aston Villa]]
In [[1903–04 in English football|1903–04]], the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their "artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing". Long after his retirement, [[Peter McWilliam]], the team's [[Defender (association football)|defender]] at the time, said, "The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot." Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; [[1904–05 Football League|1904–05]], [[1906–07 Football League|1906–07]] and [[1908–09 Football League|1908–09]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle United, "Newcastle United Trophy cabinet which has been empty for many a year." |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/venue/0,19753,11065_59,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024143134/http://www.skysports.com/football/venue/0%2C19753%2C11065_59%2C00.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904–05, they nearly did the double, losing to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the [[1905 FA Cup Final]]. They were beaten again the following year by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1906 FA Cup Final]]. They reached the final again in [[1908 FA Cup Final|1908]] where they lost to Wolves. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in the [[1910 FA Cup Final|final]]. They lost again the following year in the [[1911 FA Cup Final|final]] against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The team returned to the [[1924 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final in 1924]], in the second final held at the then new [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. They defeated [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], winning the club's second [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Three years later they won the First Division championship a fourth time in [[1926–27 Football League|1926–27]], with [[Hughie Gallacher]], one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were [[Neil Harris (footballer born 1894)|Neil Harris]], [[Stan Seymour]] and [[Frank Hudspeth]]. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and at the same time [[Andy Cunningham (footballer)|Andy Cunningham]] became the club's first team manager. In [[1931–32 Football League|1931–32]], the club won the [[1932 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the [[1933–34 Football League|1933–34 season]], the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and [[Tom Mather]] took over.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the [[1937–38 Football League|1937–38 season]], when they were spared on goal averages. However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in [[Jackie Milburn]], [[Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1923)|Tommy Walker]] and [[Bobby Cowell]]. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48 season]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; During the 1950s, Newcastle won the [[FA Cup]] trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in [[1951 FA Cup Final|1951]], Arsenal in [[1952 FA Cup Final|1952]], and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in [[1955 FA Cup Final|1955]]. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61 season]] under the management of [[Charlie Mitten]]. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player [[Joe Harvey]]. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the [[1964–65 in English football|1964–65 season]] after winning the Second Division title.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]] and the following year won the [[1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final]], triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's [[Újpest FC|Újpest]] in the final.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===The 70s and 80s===
Harvey bought striker [[Malcolm Macdonald]] in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]180,000 (worth ₤{{inflation|UK|180000|1971}} in 2016).&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey left the club in 1975, with [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]] brought in to replace him. Lee took the team to the [[1976 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said "I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over". Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by [[Richard Dinnis]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78 season]]. Dinnis was replaced by [[Bill McGarry (footballer)|Bill McGarry]], and then he was replaced by [[Arthur Cox (football)|Arthur Cox]]. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84 season]], with players such as [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Chris Waddle]] and ex-[[English national football team|England]] captain [[Kevin Keegan]] the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and Keegan retired. With managers such as [[Jack Charlton]] and then [[Willie McFaul]], Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and [[Paul Gascoigne]] were sold, and the team was relegated once more in [[1988–89 in English football|1989]]. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]]. Smith left at the start of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]] and the board appointed [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] his replacement.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===The 90s===
[[File:Kevin Keegan 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kevin Keegan]] (pictured in his second spell in 2008) guided Newcastle to promotion and Champions League football from 1992 to 1997, turning United into one of the biggest clubs in England despite not winning the league]]

[[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]] became the club's chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, and he brought in [[Rob Lee]], [[Paul Bracewell]] and [[Barry Venison]] and the club won the then [[Football League Championship|First Division Championship]] at the end of the [[1992–93 Newcastle United F.C. season|1992–93 season]], earning promotion to the then new [[Premier League]]. At the end of the [[1993–94 Newcastle United F.C. season|1993–94 season]], their first year back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled "The Entertainers" by [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] and [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]], coming very close to winning the title in the former season. This success was in part due to the talent of players like [[David Ginola]], [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Alan Shearer]], who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15&amp;nbsp;million.

Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by [[Kenny Dalglish]], however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the [[1997–98 FA Premier League]], failure to progress beyond the group stages of the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League]] despite beating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and group winners [[FC Dynamo Kiev|Dynamo Kiev]] at [[St James' Park]] as well as coming from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with [[Valery Lobanovsky]]'s team in [[Ukraine]] and defeat in the [[1998 FA Cup Final]]. Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by [[Ruud Gullit]].&lt;ref name=BBC285&gt;{{cite news

In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=kits&gt;{{cite news

United's away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]], but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993.

Football had been played at St James' Park as early as 1880, the ground being occupied by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] in 1886. Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=st_james&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newcastle United was set up as a [[private company limited by shares]] on 6 September 1895.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, dominated by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=80OIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=McKeag+seymour+and+westwood+families&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6_puNi-_PAhUpKMAKHca7B3sQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=McKeag%20seymour%20and%20westwood%20families&amp;f=false|title=Newcastle United: The Day the Promises Had to Stop|first= Denis |last=Cassidy|publisher=Amberley Publishing|year=2012|isbn=978-1445609034}}&lt;/ref&gt; until April 1997, when [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]], who bought 72.9% of the club for £3&amp;nbsp;million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a [[public limited company]], with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner [[Freddy Shepherd]].
