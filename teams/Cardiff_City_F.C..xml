'''Cardiff City Football Club''' ({{lang-cy|Clwb Pêl-droed Dinas Caerdydd}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in  [[Cardiff]], Wales. The team compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]], as of the [[2018–19 Cardiff City F.C. season|2018–19 season]]. Founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C., the club changed its name to Cardiff City in 1908 and entered the [[Southern Football League]] in 1910 before joining the [[English Football League]] in 1920. The team's longest period in the top tier of English football came between 1921 and 1929. Since then, they have spent a total of nine seasons in the top flight, the most recent being in the current [[2018–19 Premier League|2018–19 Premier League season]].

The club is the only team from outside England to have won the [[FA Cup]], doing so in [[1927 FA Cup Final|1927]]. They have also reached three other cup finals in English competitions, the [[1925 FA Cup Final]] against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], the [[2008 FA Cup Final]] against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and the [[2012 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], suffering defeat on each occasion. They have won the [[Welsh Cup]] on 22 occasions, making them the second most successful team in the competition's history behind [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. 

With the exception of a short period this century, the team have played in home colours of blue and white since 1908, which gives them the nickname "The Bluebirds". The club's first permanent ground was [[Ninian Park]] opened in 1910; it remained in use for 99 years until the club moved into the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] in 2009. Cardiff have long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], known as the [[South Wales derby]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], known as the [[Severnside derby]]. The club's record appearance holder is [[Billy Hardy (footballer)|Billy Hardy]], who made 590 appearances in a 20 year playing spell with Cardiff, and their record goalscorer is [[Len Davies]] with 179 goals.

==History==
{{main article|History of Cardiff City F.C.}}

===Early years (1899–1920)===
Following a meeting at the home of [[Lithography|lithographic]] artist [[Bartley Wilson]] in Cardiff,&lt;ref name="Hayes208"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2006|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; the club was founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C. as a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club together and in shape during the winter months.&lt;ref name="obscure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/obscure-story-cardiff-citys-blue-2030463 |title=The obscure story of Cardiff City's blue kit and nickname |website=WalesOnline |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |first=Steve |last=Tucker |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822012209/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/obscure-story-cardiff-citys-blue-2030463 |archive-date=22 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes5"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first season, they played [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] against local sides at their [[Sophia Gardens]] ground. In 1900 they joined the Cardiff &amp; District League for their first competitive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff city status in 1905, the club put in a request to the [[South Wales and Monmouthshire Football Association]] to change their name to Cardiff City.&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; The request was turned down as they were deemed not to be  playing at a high enough level. To enhance their standing, the team arranged to join the South Wales Amateur League in 1907. The following year they were granted permission to change the name of the club to Cardiff City.&lt;ref name="Shepherd4"&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99–20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1899-1920-724134.aspx |title=1899–1920 Foundations &amp; the Early Years |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |first=Richard |last=Shepherd |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622141513/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk//news/article/1899-1920-724134.aspx |archive-date=22 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although growing in stature, the club was forced to turn down the opportunity to join the newly formed Second Division of the [[Southern Football League]] due to a lack of facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground. Over the next two years, Cardiff played friendlies against some of Britain's top professional sides, including [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. The matches were played at various grounds in Cardiff and nearby towns so as to gauge the level of public interest in the team.&lt;ref name="grandin12"&gt;{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club eventually secured land to build their own stadium, [[Ninian Park]], which was completed in 1910. The club turned professional the same year. They made their first signing the following year with the acquisition of [[Jack Evans (Welsh footballer)|Jack Evans]] from fellow Welsh side Cwmparc.&lt;ref name="99–20"/&gt;

With the new grounds in place, Cardiff joined the Southern Football League Second Division&lt;ref name="FCHD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fchd.info/CARDIFFC.HTM |title=Cardiff City |publisher=Football Club History Database |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424201828/http://www.fchd.info/CARDIFFC.HTM |archive-date=24 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed their first manager, [[Davy McDougall]], who became [[player-manager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing Manager Appointed|newspaper=Evening Express|page=4|date=14 September 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to finish in fourth place in their first year in the league. The board decided to replace McDougall with [[Fred Stewart (football manager)|Fred Stewart]], who had previous managerial experience with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].&lt;ref name="Hayes208"/&gt; He set about adopting a more professional approach, signing several players with Football League experience, including brothers [[John Burton (footballer, born 1885)|John]] and [[George Burton (footballer)|George Burton]] and [[Billy Hardy (footballer)|Billy Hardy]]. Stewart led the team to promotion in his second season by winning the Second Division title. They remained in the First Division for the next decade, and finished in the top four on two occasions.&lt;ref name="99–20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s success and later decline (1920–1945)===
In 1920, the club submitted a successful application to join the [[English Football League|Football League]] and were placed into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the [[1920–21 in English football|1920–21 season]].&lt;ref name="99–20"/&gt; Stewart brought in several players with Football League experience, breaking the club's transfer record on two occasions to sign [[Jimmy Gill]] and later [[Jimmy Blair (footballer, born 1888)|Jimmy Blair]] from [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]]. They played their first match in the Football League on 28 August 1920, defeating Stockport County 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/august/history--the-significance-of-opening-day/ |title=Opening Day History&amp;nbsp;– Starting with success |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=1 August 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909143307/https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/august/history--the-significance-of-opening-day/ |archive-date=9 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The side finished the season in second place to win promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt; They finished behind [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on [[Goal difference|goal average]], and reached the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name="20–47"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1920-1947-724302.aspx |title=1920–1947 Great Days, Lows &amp; Recovery |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |first=Richard |last=Shepherd |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626092929/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk//news/article/1920-1947-724302.aspx |archive-date=26 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their third season in the top-tier, the team finished runners-up to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] because of a goal average difference of 0.024.&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogeneratedqos&gt;{{cite web|first=Kirk |last=McLean |title=Queens Legends: George McLachlan and the 1936 Overseas tour |url=http://www.qosfc.com/AboutUs/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |publisher=Queen of the South F.C. |accessdate=14 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226192017/http://www.qosfc.com/AboutUs/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff drew their final match 0–0 as club record goalscorer [[Len Davies]] missed a penalty.&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt;

[[File:CardiffCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|320px|Yearly table position since Cardiff City joined the Football League&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt;]]
The [[1924–25 in English football|following season]] was the first time Cardiff appeared at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], having reached their first FA Cup final.&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt; The team lost 1–0 to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] following a goal from [[England national football team|England]] international [[Fred Tunstall]].&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt; The [[1926–27 in English football|1926–27]] season was Cardiff's worst performance in the top tier of English Football since winning promotion six seasons prior, finishing in 14th position. However, they reached their second FA Cup final in the space of two years.&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt; On [[St George's Day]], 23 April 1927, at Wembley Stadium in London, Cardiff became the only non-English side to win the FA Cup by defeating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 in the [[1927 FA Cup Final|final]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7328650.stm |title=Cup friends reunited |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |first=Peter |last=Shuttleworth |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901205505/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7328650.stm |archive-date=1 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hughie Ferguson]] scored the only goal of the game in the 74th minute. He received the ball from [[Ernie Curtis]] and hurried a tame shot toward the goal;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]], the Arsenal goalkeeper, allowed the shot to slip through his grasp and knocked the ball into the net with his elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/happy-anniversary-cardiff-city-celebrate-2995570 |title=Happy anniversary: Cardiff City celebrate 86 years since their 1927 FA Cup win |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |last=Rogers |first=Gareth |date=23 April 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Fred Keenor]] received the FA Cup trophy at the end of the match from [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] only seven years after Cardiff City had entered the Football League.&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt; When the team returned to Cardiff the next day, a crowd of around 150,000 people lined the streets to welcome them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cup Winners Mobbed|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19270426/084/0007|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=[[Western Morning News]]|issue=20932|date=26 April 1927|page=7|subscription=yes|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The side also won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1927 defeating [[Rhyl F.C.|Rhyl]] 2–0. They went on to win the [[FA Charity Shield]] after beating amateur side [[Corinthian F.C.|the Corinthians]] 2–1 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club entered a period of decline after their cup success. They were relegated from the First Division in the [[1928-29 in English football|1928–29]] season, despite conceding fewer goals than any other side in the division.&lt;ref name="28–29_table"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk/final/f1928-29.html |title=Final Table for season 1928–29 |publisher=English Football League Tables |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005003/http://www.englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk/final/f1928-29.html |archive-date=2 February 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They suffered a second relegation two years later, dropping into the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] for the first time since they joined the Football League.&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt; During their first season in the division, Cardiff recorded their biggest-ever win when they beat [[Thames A.F.C.|Thames]] by a scoreline of 9–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They finished the [[1932–33 in English football|1932–33 season]] in 19th place, resulting in manager Fred Stewart tendering his resignation from his post after 22 years in charge.&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt; Club founder Bartley Wilson stepped in to replace Stewart. Results continued to be disappointing, however, and in March 1934, [[Ben Watts-Jones]] was given the opportunity to manage the club he had supported as a youngster. He was unable to turn the team's fortunes around by the end of the season, and Cardiff City were forced to apply for re-election after finishing bottom of the division.&lt;ref name="Hayes208"/&gt; Watts-Jones remained in charge for another three years until [[Billy Jennings (Welsh footballer)|Bill Jennings]] replaced him. Cardiff remained in the Third Division South until the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt;

===Post war and European competition (1945–2000)===
In their first season since the resumption of the Football League, under new manager [[Billy McCandless]], Cardiff finished the [[1946–47 in English football|1946–47]] season as champions of the Third Division South and returned to the Second Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2006|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by [[Cyril Spiers]] who led the side to promotion in the [[1951–52 in English football|1951–52]] season.&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="47–64"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1947-1964-726695.aspx |title=1947–1964 Post-War Recovery |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |first=Richard |last=Shepherd |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530142533/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk//news/article/1947-1964-726695.aspx |archive-date=30 May 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff returned to the top tier of English football for the first time in 23 years and stayed there for five seasons. &lt;ref name="20–47"/&gt; They were relegated after in 1957, after struggling in the bottom half of the table for three seasons.&lt;ref name="47–64"/&gt; They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before they were again relegated.&lt;ref name="FCHD"/&gt;

===Rivalry===

[[File:Dean, Mike (2).jpg|thumb|150px|Referee [[Mike Dean (referee)|Mike Dean]] receiving treatment after being struck by a projectile in a [[South Wales derby]] in 2009]]
Known as the [[South Wales derby]], Cardiff City's most significant rivalry is with nearby neighbours [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], and over 100 games have been played in all competitions between the sides. Swansea's first ever competitive fixture following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League.&lt;ref name="Hayes5"/&gt; The rivalry had been relatively friendly until the 1970s and 1980s. Economic issues, such as the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|UK miners' strike]], rivalry between the two cities and an increase in [[football hooliganism]] led to numerous violent clashes between fans at the fixtures. One fixture in 1993 was dubbed "The Battle of Ninian Park" for its particularly severe violence and resulted in away fans being banned from attending any fixtures between the sides for four years.&lt;ref name="guardderby"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/01/cardiff-city-swansea-premier-league-hatred |title=Cardiff and Swansea make Premier League history but hatred continues |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=James |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324052025/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/01/cardiff-city-swansea-premier-league-hatred |archive-date=24 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="derby"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cardiff-v-swansea-history-and-hurt-behind-the-squabble-for-welsh-rule-8919306.html |title=Cardiff v Swansea: History and hurt behind the squabble for Welsh rule |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |first=Ian |last=Herbert |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106085313/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cardiff-v-swansea-history-and-hurt-behind-the-squabble-for-welsh-rule-8919306.html |archive-date=6 January 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/thats-worst-violence-ever-seen-6772249 |title='The worst violence I have ever seen anywhere in my life': Football intelligence officer recalls South Wales derby clash |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=David |last=Owens |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308061942/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/thats-worst-violence-ever-seen-6772249 |archive-date=8 March 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff player [[Jason Perry (footballer)|Jason Perry]] described the period as "the dark, dark days of the derby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/cardiff-city/10422282/How-the-once-friendly-rivalry-between-Cardiff-City-and-Swansea-City-turned-poisonous.html |title=How the once-friendly rivalry between Cardiff City and Swansea City turned poisonous |newspaper=The Telegraph |first=Graham |last=Clutton |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819195106/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/cardiff-city/10422282/How-the-once-friendly-rivalry-between-Cardiff-City-and-Swansea-City-turned-poisonous.html |archive-date=19 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ban was dropped, "bubble trips" were introduced for away fans who can only attend fixtures in police escorted-convoys to travel to and from the stadium.&lt;ref name="guardderby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt;

Further political divide between the two cities was caused by the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum in 1997]] when Cardiff was chosen as the site for the newly created [[Senedd]], despite the majority of the city voting against devolution.&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt; Swansea, which largely voted in favour of devolution, received funding for a [[Wales National Pool|national swimming pool]] instead.&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt; [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]], who played for both sides, commented, "I think Cardiff has always been perceived [...] to receive whatever funding is going around. It seems to me that everything gets channelled in that direction".&lt;ref name="guardderby"/&gt; 
Further afield, the club has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the [[Severnside derby]], and to a lesser extent, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh neighbours Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each other since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 Football League games against each other. A survey by [[Football Fans Census]] in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] matching Newport in third.&lt;ref name="Rivalry Uncovered!"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rivalry uncovered! |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |publisher=[[Football Fans Census]] |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020074918/http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff's first ground was at Sophia Gardens recreational park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Recreation_Field.html |title=From Sophia to SWALEC |publisher=cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109214203/http://www.cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Recreation_Field.html |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed.&lt;ref name="grandin12"/&gt; The original intention was to name the ground Sloper Park,&lt;ref name="Hayes7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ninian Park was chosen instead after [[Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart]], who was a driving force behind the ground's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7976000/7976628.stm |title=Fans bid farewell to Ninian Park |publisher=BBC News |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812174739/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7976000/7976628.stm |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]];&lt;ref name="Shepherd4"/&gt; Lord Crichton-Stuart ceremoniously kicked off the game.&lt;ref name="Hayes7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was built with one stand. A second, which replaced an earth embankment and could hold 18,000 people, was opened in 1928. It hosted its first international match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Hayes7"/&gt; Towards the end of its lifespan, the ground was replaced for international fixtures by [[Cardiff Arms Park]] as doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1652214,00.html |title=Bluebirds average attendances |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214113648/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~1652214%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000, meant that the record stood until the grounds' closure.

However, in March 2015, it was announced that the Ninian Stand extension was to be shut for the [[2015–16 Cardiff City F.C. season|2015–16]] season due to poor ticket sales, dropping the capacity to 27,978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-new-12m-ninian-8956913 |title=Cardiff City's new £12m Ninian Stand to be mothballed less than a year after opening |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503093457/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-new-12m-ninian-8956913 |archive-date=3 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reopened the following year due to an increase in demand for tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/cardiff-city-fc-confirm-upper-11113104 |title=Cardiff City FC confirm upper Ninian stand to be used for first time this season as 'fantastic fans' flock to Derby game |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Paul |last=Abbandonato |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929164604/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/cardiff-city-fc-confirm-upper-11113104 |archive-date=29 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours, kit and crest==
===Colours===
When Riverside A.F.C. was formed in 1899, the club used a chocolate-brown and amber checkered shirt.&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; Following the club's name change to Cardiff City in 1908, they adopted a blue shirt and white or blue shorts and socks, although for the first nine years black socks were used. Kit changes over the club's history have included all blue kits, the introduction of a yellow vertical stripe during the 1970s and alternating blue stripes.&lt;ref name="Historical Kits"/&gt;

In 2012, Cardiff controversially changed their home kit colours from the traditional blue, white and yellow to red and black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 2012/13 kits revealed |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2798727,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516024659/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2798727%2C00.html |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time the club had not worn blue as its primary colour since 1908. The crest was also changed to one in which the [[Welsh Dragon]] was more prominent than the traditional bluebird. These changes were made to "appeal in 'international markets'" as part of a "major investment plan" unveiled by chairman Vincent Tan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18324804|title=Cardiff City to change kit from blue to red amid financial investment|date=6 June 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811210014/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18324804|archive-date=11 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebranding provoked strong opposition from the fans, who organised protest marches and demonstrations to voice their displeasure at the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-designers-criticise-cardiff-citys-2028814 |title=Fans and designers criticise Cardiff City's new emblem |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Simon |last=Gaskell |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812173557/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-designers-criticise-cardiff-citys-2028814 |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-26689074 |title=Thousands of Cardiff City fans march against club's blue to red rebrand |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202220221/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-26689074 |archive-date=2 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Tan previously stating that the club would only return to wearing blue if another owner was found, on 9 January 2015, after three seasons playing in the red kit, the club reverted their home kit back to blue with a red away kit in a bid to "unite" the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30741073|title=Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan agrees return to blue home kit|accessdate=9 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110072034/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30741073|archive-date=10 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/09/cardiff-red-to-blue-kit-vincent-tan |title=Cardiff revert to blue kit after Vincent Tan approves change |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=James |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831001855/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/09/cardiff-red-to-blue-kit-vincent-tan |archive-date=31 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crest history===
From 1908 Cardiff played in unadorned shirts. This changed in 1959, when they played in shirts with a simple crest featuring an image of a [[bluebird]]. The following season their shirts were plain and unadorned and remained so until 1965, when they played in shirts with the word "Bluebirds" embroidered.&lt;ref name="Historical Kits"/&gt; A new crest, similar to the one used previously, and again featuring a bluebird, was introduced in 1969. Over the years, a number of variations of this crest have been used. In the 1980s, extra features including words and additional motifs were added. A major change was made in 2012, when owner Vincent Tan attempted to rebrand the club to expand its appeal outside Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18324804|title = Cardiff City to change kit from blue to red amid financial investment|date = 6 June 2012|accessdate = 9 January 2015|website = |publisher = BBC Sport|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141229055050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18324804|archive-date = 29 December 2014|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change gave large prominence to the Welsh Dragon, reducing the bluebird to a minor feature. In March 2015, Cardiff announced a new crest which would once again feature the Bluebird predominantly with an oriental dragon replacing the standard Welsh dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-2015-crest-reveal-2322786.aspx|title = Cardiff City 2015 crest reveal|date = 9 March 2015|accessdate = 9 March 2015|publisher = Cardiff City F.C.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150311150659/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-2015-crest-reveal-2322786.aspx|archive-date = 11 March 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
