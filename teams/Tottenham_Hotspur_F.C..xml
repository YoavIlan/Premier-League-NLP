[[Wembley Stadium]] will be the club's home ground for the 2018–19 season until the [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]] opens in 2019.&lt;ref name="2019 openeing"/&gt; Their former home of [[White Hart Lane]] had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in [[Bulls Cross]] in the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. Tottenham have played in a first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898–99 season. The club's [[emblem]] is a [[Gamecock|cockerel]] standing upon a football, with a Latin [[motto]] ''Audere est Facere'' ("To Dare Is to Do"). 

Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1900–01 in English football|1901]], the only [[non-League football|non-League]] club to do so since the formation of [[the Football League]] in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]], winning both competitions in the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61 season]]. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a [[UEFA]] club competition&amp;nbsp;– the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3757030.stm|title=Tottenham legend Nicholson dies|publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2004|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the inaugural winners of the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They have collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s&amp;nbsp;– an achievement only matched by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/christian-eriksen-tottenham-fa-cup-milwall-trophy-drought-a7624586.html |title=Christian Eriksen says Tottenham are determined to end their nine-year silverware drought |newspaper=The Independent |first=Miguel |last=Delaney |date=11 March 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/manchester-united/tab/honours/|title=Manchester United football club honours|work=11v11.com|publisher=AFS Enterprises|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Spurs have won two [[List of English football champions|league titles]], eight FA Cups, four [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]s, seven [[FA Community Shield]]s, one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and two [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]s. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], with head-to-head fixtures known as the [[North London derby]].

{{Main|History of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.}}

===Formation and early years (1882–1908)===

Originally named '''Hotspur Football Club''', the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by [[Bobby Buckle]]. They were members of the Hotspur [[Cricket]] Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 1: A crowd walked across the muddy fields to watch the Hotspur play }} A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at [[All Hallows, Tottenham|All Hallows Church]], who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.spurshistory.com/pages/8.htm |title= A Romance of Football, The History of the Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |author=The Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Herald|date=1921 |page=5 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/john-ripsher-240907/ |title=John Ripsher |date=24 September 2007 |website=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2321886/Why-Tottenham-Hotspur-owe-it-all-to-a-pauper.html |title=Why Tottenham Hotspur owe it all to a pauper |first= Nicholas |last=Spencer|date= 24 September 2007 |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1884 the club was renamed "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club" to avoid confusion with another club, London Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/history/history_yearbyyear.html|title=History: Year by year|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afordawards.co.uk/blog/post/2014/11/06/Tottenham-Hotspur-Club-History-Football-Trophies.aspx |title=Tottenham Hotspur Club History &amp; Football Trophies |date=17 July 2015 |website=Aford Awards |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames for the club include "Spurs" and "the Lilywhites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nilsson |first1=Leonard Jägerskiöld |title=World Football Club Crests: The Design, Meaning and Symbolism of World Football's Most Famous Club Badges |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4729-5424-4|page=56 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2MB2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the boys played games between themselves and [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/potted-history-081104/ |title=Potted History |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |date=8 November 2004|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5–2 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company's works team called St Albans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.topspurs.com/thfc-history-timeline.htm |title= Tottenham Hotspur – Complete History |website = TOPSPURS.COM |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived [[Southern Alliance]].{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 3: Moneyball}}

The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 3: Moneyball}} Soon after, [[Frank Brettell]] became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed [[John Cameron (footballer born 1872)|John Cameron]], who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] title in the [[1899–1900 Southern Football League|1899-1900 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Romance of Football.

In doing so they became the only [[non-League football|non-League]] club to achieve the feat after the formation of [[The Football League]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hotspurhq.com/2013/04/27/tottenham-won-their-first-fa-cup-final-on-27th-april1901/ |title=Tottenham Won Their First FA Cup Final on 27th April,1901 |first=Logan|last= Holmes|work=Spurs HQ |date=27 April 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early decades in the Football League (1908–1958)===
In 1908, the club was elected into the [[Football League Second Division]] and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in their first season, and finished runners-up in their first year in the league. In 1912, [[Peter McWilliam]] became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the [[1914–15 in English football|1914–15]] season when football was suspended due to the [[World War I|First World War]]. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ahalftimereport.com/2016/07/19/peter-mcwilliam-the-tottenham-boss-who-created-legends/ |title=Peter McWilliam: The Tottenham Boss Who Created Legends |date= 19 July 2016 |work=A Halftime Report|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ArthurGrimsdell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Spurs captain [[Arthur Grimsdell]] displaying the cup to fans on [[Tottenham High Road]] after the 1921 final]]
On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 1–0 in the [[1921 FA Cup Final|Cup Final]]. Spurs finished second to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the league in [[1921–22 in English football|1922]], but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the [[1927–28 in English football|1927–28 season]] after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 40s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the [[1933–34 in English football|1933–34]] and [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]] seasons.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 8: Spurs Shot Themselves in the Foot}}

Former Spurs player [[Arthur Rowe]] became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as "[[push and run]]", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the [[1949–50 in English football|1949–50 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-arthur-rowe-1503440.html |title=Obituary: Arthur Rowe |first=Reg |last=Drury |date=11 November 1993|work=The Independent |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the [[1950–51 in English football|1950–51 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/21/joy-of-six-promoted-success-stories |title=The Joy of Six: Newly promoted success stories| author=Scott Murray |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eedd.html |title=English Energy and Nordic Nonsense| author=Karel Stokkermans|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 11: One of the Good Guys}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klPTonGmpXsC&amp;pg=PT634 |title=Players: 250 Men, Women and Animals Who Created Modern Sport |first= Tim|last= Harris |publisher= Vintage Digital |date=10 November 2009|isbn=9781409086918 |chapter=Arthur Rowe |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he left, he signed one of Spurs' most celebrated players, [[Danny Blanchflower]], who would win the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] twice while at Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/special-feature-on-danny-blanchflower-90th-birthday-100216/ |title=Danny Blanchflower – Captain, leader, All-Time Great|date= 10 February 2016 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spurs team with the Cup Winners' Cup trophy 1963.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|[[Danny Blanchflower]] with the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup trophy in 1963]]
[[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] took over as manager in October 1958. He would become the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1961]], the FA Cup in 1962 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1963]].&lt;ref name=""nicholson"/&gt; Nicholson signed [[Dave Mackay]] and [[John White (footballer born 1937)|John White]] in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and [[Jimmy Greaves]] in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the [[List of English football first tier top scorers|top tier of English football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/28/cristiano-ronaldo-can-match-magical-mark-set-jimmy-greaves/ |title=Special report: Jimmy Greaves pays tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo as Portuguese closes in on his magical mark |first=Jeremy|last= Wilson|date=28 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 12: Going Up, Up, Up}}

The [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1960–61 season]] started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11168764/manchester-city-will-smash-tottenham-record-with-a-win-at-swansea |title=Manchester City smash all-time Football League record with win at Swansea |date= 14 December 2017 |first=Adam |last=Smith |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at home 2–1, with three more games still to play.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 13: What's the Story, Eternal Glory?}} The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2–0 against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[1961 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1960–61 FA Cup]]. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] achieved the feat in [[1896–97 in English football|1897]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321969.stm |title=1961 – Spurs' double year|date=10 May 2001|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year Spurs won their second consecutive FA Cup after beating [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the [[1962 FA Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/the-cup-final-1962 |title=The Cup Final 1962 |work= British Pathé |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the [[1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup]] when they beat [[Atlético Madrid]] 5–1 in the [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/it-was-50-years-ago-today-our-historic-win-in-europe-150513/|title=It was 50 years ago today – our historic win in Europe...|date= 15 May 2013 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the [[1971–72 UEFA Cup]] with a rebuilt team that included [[Martin Chivers]], [[Pat Jennings]], and [[Steve Perryman]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1988|page=48}} They had also won the [[1967 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 1967]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/club/history/joe-kinnear-mike-england-jimmy-robertson-1967-spurs-fa-cup-chelsea-190417/ |title=Kinnear, Robertson, England and Mullery: 1967 FA Cup Heroes on Playing Chelsea at Wembley |date=19 April 2017 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s (in [[1971 Football League Cup Final|1971]] and [[1973 Football League Cup Final|1973]]).

Spurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2003|pages=150–154}}  The team was then relegated at the end of the [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77 season]] with [[Keith Burkinshaw]] as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included [[Glenn Hoddle]], as well as two [[Argentina|Argentinians]], [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] and [[Ricardo Villa]], whose signings were particularly uncommon in the British game as foreign players in British football were rare at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/ricky-villa-i-recognise-i-am-a-little-part-of-english-football-history-480704.html |title=Ricky Villa: 'I recognise I am a little part of English football history' |first=Brian |last=Viner |work=The Independent |date= 1 June 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in [[1981 FA Cup Final|1981]] and [[1982 FA Cup Final|1982]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29476689 |title=Top 50 FA Cup goals: 'And still Ricky Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 November 2014|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[1984 UEFA Cup Final|1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/remembering-tottenhams-1984-uefa-cup-winners-a3094431.html |title=Anderlecht vs Tottenham: Remembering Spurs' 1984 Uefa Cup winners |first=Richard |last= Parry |date= 22 October 2015 |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. [[Irving Scholar]] took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises.&lt;ref name="Twohundredpercent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twohundredpercent.net/100-owners-number-81-irving-scholar-tottenham-hotspur-nottingham-forest/ |title= 100 Owners: Number 81 – Irving Scholar (Tottenham Hotspur &amp; Nottingham Forest)|date=11 October 2012 |work=Twohundredpercent|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ6MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Association Game: A History of British Football|first= Matthew|last= Taylor |page=342 |publisher= Routledge |date= 18 October 2013|isbn=9781317870081|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and [[Terry Venables]] teamed up with businessman [[Alan Sugar]] in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur [[Public limited company|plc]].&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-turbulent-times-at-tottenham-hotspur-1491853.html |title=Football: Turbulent times at Tottenham Hotspur |date= 14 June 1993 |work=The Independent |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc profile"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6923678.stm |title=Profile: Sir Alan Sugar |publisher=BBC |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horrie"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/they-saw-an-open-goal-and-directors-scored-a-million-1109892.html |title=They saw an open goal, and directors scored a million|first=Chris |last=Horrie |date=31 July 1999 |work=The Independent|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as [[Paul Gascoigne]] and [[Gary Lineker]].

Tottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the [[Premier League]], created with the approval of [[The Football Association]], replacing the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2012/feb/02/20-years-premier-league-football-1992 |title=Premier League football at 20: 1992, the start of a whole new ball game |first=Jason |last=Rodrigues|date= 2 February 2012 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a succession of managers and players such as [[Teddy Sheringham]], [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] and [[David Ginola]], for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the [[1999 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1999]] under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]], and again in [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008]] under [[Juande Ramos]].

==Stadia/playing grounds ==

===Early grounds===
Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of [[Tottenham Marshes]], where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 1: A crowd walked across the muddy fields to watch the Hotspur play }} Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt; The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0.{{sfn |The Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Herald|1921 |p=6 }} It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (then known as Royal Arsenal) leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topspurs.com/thfc-november.htm |publisher=topspurs.com |title=A Month in the Illustrious History of Spurs: November |first=Logan |last=Holmes |accessdate=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tottenham Hotspur vs Newton Heath January 1899.jpg|thumb|Northumberland Park, 28 January 1899, Spurs vs Newton Heath (later renamed [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]])]]
As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm, next to the railway line at [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]], at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged [[Threepence (British coin)|3d]] a game, raised to 6d for cup ties.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 2: Enclosure Changed the Game Forever }} The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired.{{sfn|The Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Herald|1921 |pp=22–23 }} In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs were forced to look for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/tottenham-hotspur-spurs-white-hart-lane-farewell-goodbye-diego-maradon-johan-cruyff-a7733846.html|title=White Hart Lane has seen Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff, but after 118 years Tottenham have outgrown it|first= Martin |last=Cloake |date=13 May 2017|publisher=The Independent |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White Hart Lane===
{{Main|White Hart Lane}}
[[File:First match at White Hart Lane - Spurs vs Notts County 1899 - first half.jpg|thumb|First game at White Hart Lane, Spurs vs [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for the official opening on 4 September 1899]]
The White Hart Lane ground was built on a disused nursery owned by the brewery [[Charringtons]] and located behind a [[public house]] named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators.&lt;ref name="stadium history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/the-stadium/history/ |title= History of White Hart Lane |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/spurs-v-notts-county-1899-030804/ |title=Spurs v Notts County 1899 |date= 3 August 2004 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the [[fee simple|freehold]] to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;
[[File:White Hart Lane Jan 2008.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|Since 1910, Tottenham have displayed a bronze cast of a cockerel made by a former player]]

After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by [[Archibald Leitch]] being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;
[[File:White Hart Lane Aerial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aerial image of [[White Hart Lane]]. Redevelopment of this stadium began in early 1980s and completed in the late 1990s.]]

Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the [[Taylor Report]]'s recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant [[Sony]] [[Jumbotron]] TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings.&lt;ref name="stadium history2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/stadium-history-070704/ |title=Stadium History |date=7 July 2004 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen.&lt;ref name="stadium history2"/&gt;  Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;

By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|2012 London Olympic Stadium]] in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spurs1882.org/misc/WHL_EastStand2001_PlanningStatement.pdf |title=Proposed New East Stand Redevelopment for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |date=June 2001 |work=Spurs Since 1882 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ley"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/8036137/Tottenham-interested-in-making-London-2012-Olympic-Stadium-their-new-ground.html |title=Tottenham interested in making London 2012 Olympic Stadium their new ground |first= John |last=Ley|date=1 October 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the club settled on the [[Northumberland Development Project]], whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/tottenham-champions-league-fixtures-wembley-stadium |title=Tottenham Hotspur to play Champions League matches at Wembley |work=The Guardian |date=28 May 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic fixtures of the [[2016–17 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2016–17 season]] continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/15/tottenham-waste-no-time-white-hart-lane-demolition-work-begins/ |title=Tottenham waste no time as White Hart Lane demolition work begins |first=Mark |last=Molloy |date=15 May 2017 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/historic-update-spurs-new-stadium-13412817 |title=Historic update on Spurs new stadium site as last visual remnants of White Hart Lane disappear |first=Adam |last= Jones |date=31 July 2017|work=Football London|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7699135.stm|title=Tottenham reveal new ground plan|publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2008|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by [[Haringey Council]] in September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004120344/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/futureplans/news/stadium-plans-011010.html |title= Stadium Plans|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/futureplans/news/stadium-plans-011010.html |archivedate=4 October 2010 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed 20 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14996725.stm|title=Tottenham sign planning agreement to build new stadium|publisher=BBC|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest==
Since the 1921 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] has featured a [[cockerel]]. [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Harry Hotspur]], after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles,&lt;ref name="insall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planningservices.haringey.gov.uk/portal/servlets/AttachmentShowServlet?ImageName=748708 |title=Northumberland Development Project |date=September 2015 |work=Haringey Council |author=Donald Insall Associates|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also said to be fond of [[Cockfight|fighting cocks]] fitted with spurs.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt; The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock.&lt;ref name="insall"/&gt; A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35, and this 9-foot 6-inch figure was then placed on top of the [[White Hart Lane|West Stand]] the end of the 1909–10 season.&lt;ref name="insall"/&gt; Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/aug/31/theknowledge.sport |title=The most unlikely football bet to come off |author=James Dart |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The lions flanking the shield came from the Northumberland family (of which Harry Hotspur was a member). The castle is [[Bruce Castle]], 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the [[Seven Sisters, London|Seven Sisters]]. The arms featured the Latin motto ''Audere Est Facere'' (to dare is to do).&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;

In 1983, to overcome unauthorised [[copyright infringement|"pirate"]] merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red [[supporter|heraldic lions]] and the [[motto|motto scroll]].

==Kit==
The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=20–21}}  In 1884 or 1985, the club changed to a "quartered" kit similar to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] after watching them win in the [[1884 FA Cup Final]].{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=22}} After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the [[1889–90 in English football|1889–90 season]]. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=24–25}} Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.&lt;ref name="historickits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Tottenham_Hotspur/Tottenham_Hotspur.htm |title=Historical Kits&amp;nbsp;– Tottenham Hotspur |work=''historicalkits.co.uk'' |publisher=Historic Football Kits |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–99 season]], their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=26}} White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname "The Lilywhites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://premierskillsenglish.britishcouncil.org/clubs/tottenham-hotspur |title=Tottenham Hotspur |work=Premier Skill English |accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, after they had won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.  In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;

In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on [[Seven Sisters Road]], HR Brookes.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 2: Enclosure Changed the Game Forever }} In the 1920s, [[Bukta]] produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, [[Umbro]] was the supplier for forty years until a deal was signed with [[Admiral (sportswear)|Admiral]] in 1977 to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold since  1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=80–82}} Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer's logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=80–82}} Admiral was replaced by [[Le Coq Sportif]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=85}} In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with [[Hummel International|Hummel]], who then supplied the strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://museumofjerseys.com/2017/02/07/tottenham-hotspur-the-hummel-years/ |title=Tottenham Hotspur: the Hummel years |date=7 February 2017 |work=Museum of Jerseys |accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiaspurs.com/blog/tottenham-hotspur-kit-history-5-1983-1995 |title=Tottenham Hotspur Kit History 5 -  1983 -1995|date=14 November 2016 |work=India Spurs |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[Pony International|Pony]] in 1995, [[Adidas]] in 1999, [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]] in 2002,&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1930719.stm |title=Spurs sign new kit deal |date=15 April 2002 |work=BBC |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a five-year deal with [[Puma AG|Puma]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4701810.stm |title=Spurs sign new kit deal with Puma |date=10 February 2006|work=BBC |accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, [[Under Armour]] announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12685894 |title=Tottenham Hotspur sign kit deal with Under Armour|work=BBC |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-08/under-armour-gets-premier-league-presence-with-tottenham-apparel-contract.html |title=Under Armour Gets Premier League Presence With Tottenham Apparel Contract |date=8 March 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |first1=Tariq |last1=Panja |first2=Danielle |last2=Rossingh|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.footballkitnews.com/6794/new-tottenham-kit-20122013-under-armour-spurs-jerseys-1213-home-away-thfc/ |title=New Tottenham Kit 2012/2013– Under Armour Spurs Jerseys 12/13 Home Away THFC |date=12 July 2012|work=Football Kit News |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2012/08/29/tottenham-use-fifa-13-computer-game-to-launch-new-third-kit-555875/ |title=Tottenham use Fifa 13 computer game to launch new third kit |first=Jack|last= Leather|date= 29 August 2012|work=Metro|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the [[biometric data]] to the coaching staff.&lt;ref name="stride"/&gt; In June 2017, it was announced that [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] would be the new kits supplier, with the 2017–18 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nike.com/news/tottenham-hotspur-2017-18|title=A New Era Dawns: Nike Football Outfits Tottenham Hotspur For 2017–18|date=30 June 2017|website=Nike|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth £30 million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/tottenham-hotspur-spurs-nike-deal |title=Tottenham Hotspur reveal details of bumper 15-year Nike deal |date=29 October 2018|first= Stephan |last=Georgiou |work= SportsPro |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club [[Kettering Town F.C.]] in 1976, and this practice then spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and on television in 1983.&lt;ref name="stride"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Sports in History |title=From Sportswear to Leisurewear: The Evolution of English Football League Shirt Design in the Replica Kit Era |authors=Stride, Christopher; Williams, Jean; Moor, David; Catley, Nick |pages=156–194 | date= 12 December 2014 |volume =35  |doi=10.1080/17460263.2014.986518}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=116}} In December 1983, soon after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, [[Holsten]] became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=The Global Art of Soccer |first= Richard |last=Witzig|page=78 |isbn=9780977668809 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[TUI UK|Thomson]] was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1925316.stm |title=Spurs fans see red over logo |publisher=BBC |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship deal with internet casino group [[Mansion.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jol-to-benefit-from-16334m-shirt-deal-478418.html |title=Jol to benefit from £34m shirt deal |date=16 May 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Adrian |last=Curtis |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy]] said to be worth £20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/7879643/Tottenham-announce-20m-shirt-sponsorship-deal-with-Autonomy.html |title=Tottenham announce £20m shirt sponsorship deal with Autonomy |date=8 July 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |first=John |last=Ley |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later they unveiled a £5&amp;nbsp;million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm [[Investec Bank|Investec]] as shirt sponsor for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and domestic cup competitions for the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10997870 |title=Tottenham Hotspur name Investec as second shirt sponsor |date=17 August 2010 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investec"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.investec.co.uk/about-investec/sponsorship/tottenham-hotspur-football-club.html |title=Sponsorship Tottenham Hotspur |work=''investec.co.uk'' |publisher=Investec |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, [[AIA Group Limited|AIA]] has been the main shirt sponsor in a deal worth over £16 million annually.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/aia-to-become-tottenham-hotspurand39s-new-principal-partner-130214/|title=AIA to Become Tottenham Hotspur's New Principal Partner |date=13 February 2014 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-extend-aia-kit-deal-to-2022-nutil-spurs-seal-increase-on-original-16mayear-agreement-a3548496.html |title=Tottenham EPL news: Spurs extend AIA kit deal until 2022 as they |date=25 May 2017 |work=Evening Standard |accessdate=25 May 2017 |first=Tom |last=Collomosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Attendances 1950s |url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng50.htm |work=European Football Statistics |accessdate=26 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014095724/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng50.htm |archivedate=14 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Attendances 1960s|url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng60.htm|work=European Football Statistics|accessdate=26 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014095848/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng60.htm|archivedate=14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008–09 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Statistics/0,,12306,00.html |title=Statistics |publisher=FA Premier League |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2017–18 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2017–18 season]] when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second highest attendance in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/eng-premier-league-2017-2018/1/ |title=Premier League 2017/2018 » Attendance » Home matches |work=''Worldfootball.net'' |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher [[A.J.

Historically, the club had a significant [[Jewish]] following from the Jewish communities in East and Northeast London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/how-tottenham-became-the-jewish-football-team-1.53784 |title=Spurs and the Jews: the how, the why and the when |first1=Martin |last1=Cloake|first2= Alan|last2= Fisher|date=6 October 2016 |work=The Jewish Chronicle |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), it is nevertheless identified as a Jewish club by rival fans.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 10: Does your rabbi know you’re here? }} This has led to much [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] provocation with chants of "[[Yids]]" or "Yiddos" against Tottenham supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/28/newsstory.sport2|work=The Guardian |location=UK |title=Alive and unchecked&amp;nbsp;– a wave of anti-Jewish hate|first=Anna|last=Kessel | date=28 October 2007|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/david-baddiel-so-you-think-weve-kicked-racism-out-of-english-football-614251.html|work=The Independent |location=UK |last=Baddiel|first=David|title=So you think we've kicked racism out of English football | date=17 October 2002|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the "Yids" or "Yid Army" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iye9CDk0X_IC&amp;pg=PA244 |title=Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe |editor=Michael Brenner, Gideon Reuveni |pages=241–245 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans view adopting "Yid" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629172805/http://timesonline.typepad.com/david_aaronovitch/2007/03/aaronovitch_yid.html|title=Aaronovitch yiddos|work=The Times |location=London |date=18 March 2007 |archivedate=29 June 2007|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/david_aaronovitch/2007/03/aaronovitch_yid.html|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "Yid" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans "legitimis[es] references to Jews in football",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/lets-forget-opposition-supporters-even-as-a-term-of-endearment-yid-army-is-offensive/|title=Let's forget opposition supporters.

===Fan culture===
There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as "[[Glory Glory (football chant)|Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur]]". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1960–61]], and the club entered the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time. Their first opponents were [[Górnik Zabrze]], the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to describe them as "they were no angels". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into [[togas]], sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing [[biblical]]-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of "[[Glory Glory (football chant)|Glory Glory Hallelujah]]", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glory Glory Nights:The Official Story of Tottenham Hotspur in Europe|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/12/glory-glory-nights-official-story-tottenham-hotspur-europe|website=New Statesman|first=Martin|last=Cloake|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: {{quotation|A new sound was heard in English football in the 1961–2 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I don't know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling.|Bill Nicholson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spurs V Quarabag-Back in Time|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/qarabag-home-back-in-time-170915/|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There had been a number of incidences of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in [[Rotterdam]] at the [[1974 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Feyenoord]], and again during the [[1983–84 UEFA Cup]] matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jun/19/euro2000.sport3 |title=England told: more rioting and you're out |first=Vivek |last=Chaudhary|date=19 June 2000|work=The Guardian |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidences of hooliganism continued to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/10-fans-knifed-in-chelsea-battle-7210890.html |title=10 fans knifed in Chelsea battle |first=Richard |last=Edwards|date= 12 March 2007 |work=London Evening Standard|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.thecnj.com/camden_review/news/2010/aug/hooligans-%E2%80%98put-their-hoods-and-attacked-pub%E2%80%99 |title=Hooligans 'put up their hoods and attacked pub' |work=The Camden Review |date= 13 August 2010 |first=Róisín |last=Gadelrab|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
{{main|North London derby|Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry}}
Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with [[North London derby|north London rivals]] Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]], [[Plumstead]] to [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]], and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.{{sfn|Goodwin|2003|pages=30, 34–34}} They also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |title=Rivalry uncovered!

==Social responsibility==
The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with [[Haringey Council]] and the [[Metropolitan Housing Trust]] and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation/news/foundationnews_haringeymultisportsummercoachingprogramme.html |title=Haringley Multi-Sport Summer Coaching Programme |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322010725/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation/news/foundationnews_haringeymultisportsummercoachingprogramme.html |archive-date=22 March 2011 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalliteracytrust.org.uk/football/FootballClubs/spurs.html |title=Promoting literacy through the power of sport |publisher=National Literacy Trust&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605125334/http://www.nationalliteracytrust.org.uk/football/FootballClubs/spurs.html |archive-date=5 June 2009 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] when it was launched at [[10 Downing Street]] in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs/News/Archive/academy_news_2007_2_440.page |title=Tottenham Hotspur Foundation receives strong political backing |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |date=4 February 2007|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity [[SOS Children's Villages UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/tottenham-sos-partnership-270307.htm |title=Tottenham Hotspur teams up with SOS Children |date=27 March 2007 |publisher=SOS Children's Villages |access-date=30 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522083521/http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/tottenham-sos-partnership-270307.htm |archive-date=22 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Player fines will go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa with the funds being used to cover the running costs as well as in support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentgiving.com/files/IG_Prem_giving_league_07.pdf |title=The Intelligentgiving.com Premiership Giving League 2007 |publisher=Intelligentgiving.com |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5&amp;nbsp;million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | agency = [[Press Association]] | url = http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2007-03-26-Chelsea-FC-near-bottom-of-charitable-donations-league | title = Chelsea FC 'near bottom' of charitable donations league | date = 26 March 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052131/http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2007-03-26-Chelsea-FC-near-bottom-of-charitable-donations-league | archivedate = 6 December 2008 | df = dmy-all |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compared to donations of £9,763 in 2005–06.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/docstore/tottenham_ar2006_72dpi.pdf |title=Tottenham Hotspur PLC Annual Report 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409101702/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/docstore/tottenham_ar2006_72dpi.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2008 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The football club is one of the highest profile participants in the [[10:10]] project which encourages individuals, businesses and organisations to take action on environmental issues. They joined in 2009 in a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint. To do this they upgraded their lights to more efficient models, they turned down their heating dials and took less short-haul flights among a host of other things.&lt;ref name="global1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1010global.org/uk/spurs |title=Case study: Tottenham Hotspur &amp;#124; 10:10 |publisher=1010global.org |accessdate=17 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407015727/http://www.1010global.org/uk/spurs |archivedate=7 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After working with 10:10 for one year, they reported that they had reduced their carbon emissions by 14%.&lt;ref name="global1"/&gt;

In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing (100 out of 200), but this was reduced to 0 out of 285&lt;ref name="insidehousing.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/spurs-given-green-light-to-drop-affordable-homes/6520463.article/|title=Spurs given green light to drop affordable homes|publisher=insidehousing.co.uk|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814152927/http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/spurs-given-green-light-to-drop-affordable-homes/6520463.article/|archivedate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Spurs suggested that the development was not financially viable with this obligation. In addition, a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m.&lt;ref name="insidehousing.co.uk"/&gt;  This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/30/tottenham-new-stadium-fury-regeneration |title=Tottenham's new stadium masterplan: the fury amid the regeneration|first= David |last=Conn|date= 30 October 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2016/12/09/spurs-new-stadium-provides-3500-jobs-boost-will-pump-293m-economy/|title=Spurs new stadium provides 3,500 jobs boost and will pump £293m into economy |date=9 December 2016 |work=Inside World Football |first=Paul |last=Nicholson |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714032108/http://tottenhamhotspur.com/new-scheme/project-update/ |archivedate=14 July 2015 |title=Project Update |url=http://tottenhamhotspur.com/new-scheme/project-update/ |deadurl=yes |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/tottenham_illustrative_map.pdf |title=Tottenham is the next chapter of london's regeneration story and boasts |work= Haringey Council |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Tottenham Hotspur L.F.C.}}
Tottenham's women's team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991–92 season and played in the [[London and South East Women's Regional Football League]] (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 2007–08. In the 2016–17 season they won the [[FA Women's Premier League Southern Division]] and a subsequent playoff, gaining promotion to the [[FA Women's Super League 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spursladies/news/spurs-ladies-win-play-off-290517/|title=Spurs Ladies all set for Women's Super League 29 May 2017 – News |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
