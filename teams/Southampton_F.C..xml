'''Southampton Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Southampton.ogg|s|aʊ|θ|ˈ|(|h|)|æ|m|p|t|ən}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], England, which plays in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]].

Their home ground since 2001 has been [[St Mary's Stadium]], before which they were based at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]]. The club has been nicknamed "The Saints" since its inception in 1885 due to its history as a church football team, founded as St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association, and play in red and white shirts. Southampton has a long-standing rivalry with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] due to its close proximity and both cities' respective [[maritime history]]. Matches between the two sides are known as the [[South Coast derby]].

The club has won the [[FA Cup]] once, in [[1976 FA Cup final|1976]], and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]].&lt;ref name="Second"&gt;{{cite news |title=Caught in Time: Southampton finish runners-up in the First Division, 1984 |first=Greg |last=Struthers |work=The Times |location=London |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article732419.ece |accessdate=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005, ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4525113.stm|title=Southampton 1 – 2 Man Utd|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned after a seven-year absence, and have played there ever since.

==History==
{{Main|History of Southampton F.C.}}

[[File:Southampton FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Southampton in the Football League.]]

===Foundation and Southern League (1885–1920)===
Southampton were originally founded at [[St. Mary's Church, Southampton|St. Mary's Church]], on 21 November 1885 by members of the St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association.

St. Mary's Y.M.A., as they were usually referred to in the local press, played most of their early games on [[Southampton Common|The Common]] where games were frequently interrupted by pedestrians insistent on exercising their right to roam. More important matches, such as cup games, were played either at the [[County Ground, Southampton|County Cricket Ground]] in Northlands Road or the [[Antelope Ground|Antelope Cricket Ground]] in St Mary's Road.

The club was originally known as '''St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C.''' (usually abbreviated to "St. Mary's Y.M.A.") and then became simply '''St. Mary's F.C.''' in [[1887–88 in English football|1887–88]], before adopting the name '''Southampton St. Mary's''' when the club joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1894.

For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including [[Charles Baker (footballer)|Charles Baker]], [[Alf Littlehales]] and [[Lachie Thomson]] from [[Stoke F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Fred Hollands]] from [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref name = "Chalk16"&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|author2=Holley, Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987| isbn= 0-907969-22-4 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the Southern League title in [[1896–97 in English football|1896–97]], the club became a limited company and was renamed '''Southampton F.C.'''

Southampton won the Southern League championship for three years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built £10,000 stadium called [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]], to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain in those early days and the club had to rent the premises first before they could afford to buy the stadium in the early part of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four [[FA Cup Final]]s in [[FA Cup Final 1900|1900]]. On that day, they went down 4–0 to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] as they were beaten 2–1 in a replay of the [[FA Cup Final 1902|1902 final]].

===Joining the Football League (1920–1966)===
After [[World War I]], Saints joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920 which split into [[Football League Third Division South|South]] and [[Football League Third Division North|North]] sections a year later. The [[1921–22 in English football|1921–22 season]] ended in triumph with promotion and marked the beginning of a 31-year stay in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].

The [[1922–23 in English football|1922–23 season]] was a unique "Even Season" – 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 defeats for a total of 42 points, or one point per game. Goals for and against statistics were also equal and the team finished in mid-table.

In 1925 and 1927, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 and 2–1 to Sheffield United and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] respectively.

Saints were briefly forced to switch home matches to the ground of their local rivals [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at [[Fratton Park]] during [[World War II]] when a bomb landed on The Dell pitch in November 1940, leaving an 18-foot crater which damaged an underground culvert and flooded the pitch.

Promotion was narrowly missed in [[1947–48 in English football|1947–48]] when they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following [[1948–49 in English football|season]] (despite having an eight-point lead with eight games to play) whilst in [[1949–50 in English football|1949–50]] they were to be denied promotion by 0.06 of a goal, missing out on second place to Sheffield United. In the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons, [[Charlie Wayman]] rattled in a total of 56 goals. Then relegation in [[1952–53 in English football|1953]] sent Saints sliding back into Division 3 (South).

It took until [[1959–60 in English football|1960]] for Saints to regain Second Division status with [[Derek Reeves]] plundering 39 of the champions' 106 league goals. On 27 April 1963 a crowd of 68,000 at [[Villa Park]] saw them lose 1–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup semi-final.

===Reaching the First Division and cup win (1966–1977)===
In [[1965–66 in English football|1966]], when [[Ted Bates (footballer)|Ted Bates]]' team were promoted to the First Division as runners-up, with [[Martin Chivers]] scoring 30 of Saints' 85 league goals.

For the following campaign [[Ron Davies (footballer, born 1942)|Ron Davies]] arrived to score 43 goals in his first season. Saints stayed among the elite for eight years, with the highest finishing position being seventh place in 1968–69 and again in 1970–71. These finishes were high enough for them to qualify for the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1969–70]] (going out in Round 3 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]) and its successor, the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[1971–72 UEFA Cup|1971–72]], when they went out in the first round to [[Athletic Bilbao]].

In December 1973, Bates stood down to be replaced by his assistant [[Lawrie McMenemy]]. The Saints were one of the first victims of the new three-down relegation system in [[1973–74 in English football|1974]].

Under McMenemy's management, Saints started to rebuild in the Second Division, capturing players such as [[Peter Osgood]], [[Jim McCalliog]], [[Jim Steele (footballer)|Jim Steele]] and [[Peter Rodrigues]] (captain) and in 1976, Southampton reached the [[FA Cup Final 1976|FA Cup Final]], playing Manchester United at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], and beat much-fancied United 1–0 with a goal from [[Bobby Stokes]]. The following season, they played in Europe again in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1976–77|Cup Winners' Cup]], reaching Round 3 where they lost 2–3 on aggregate to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].

===Return to First Division (1977–1992)===
In [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78]], captained by [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]], Saints finished runners-up in the Second Division (behind [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]) and returned to the First Division. They finished comfortably in 14th place in their first season back in the top flight. The following season they returned to Wembley in the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] where they acquitted themselves well, losing 3–2 to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].

In 1980, McMenemy made his biggest signing, capturing the [[European Footballer of the Year]] [[Kevin Keegan]]. Although Keegan's Southampton career only lasted two years, Saints fielded an attractive side also containing Alan Ball, prolific goal-scorer Ted MacDougall, (who still holds the record for the largest number of goals in an FA Cup game&amp;nbsp;– nine&amp;nbsp;– for Bournemouth against Margate in an 11–0 win), MacDougall's strike partner at Bournemouth and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] [[Phil Boyer]], club stalwart [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]] and in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]] they scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish. The following season, Kevin Keegan helped lift the club to the top of the First Division. Southampton led the league for over two months, taking top spot on 30 January 1982 and staying there (apart from one week) until 3 April 1982. But in a disappointing end to the season, in which Keegan was hampered by a back injury, Southampton won only two of their last nine games and finished seventh. The winners of a wide-open title race were Keegan's old club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who were crowned champions on the final day of the season. Keegan scored 26 of Southampton's 72 goals that season, but was then sold to Newcastle.

Southampton continued to progress under McMenemy's stewardship, and with a team containing [[Peter Shilton]] (the [[England national football team|England]] goalkeeper), [[Nick Holmes (footballer)|Nick Holmes]], [[David Armstrong (English footballer)|David Armstrong]], striker [[Steve Moran]] and quick winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]] reached their highest ever league finish as runners-up in [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]]&lt;ref name="Second"/&gt; (three points behind the champions Liverpool) as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup losing 1–0 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Highbury Stadium]]. McMenemy then added experienced midfielder [[Jimmy Case]] to his ranks.

They finished fifth the following year, but as a result of the [[Heysel Disaster]] all English clubs were banned from European competition: had it not been for this, then Southampton would have again qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].

McMenemy left at the end of the 1984–85 season to be succeeded by [[Chris Nicholl]], who was sacked after six years in charge despite preserving the club's top flight status. He was replaced by [[Ian Branfoot]], who until the end of the 1990–91 season had been assistant manager to [[Steve Coppell]] at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was [[Guernsey]]-born attacking midfielder/striker [[Matthew Le Tissier]], who broke into the first team in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]]. He was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team&amp;nbsp;– he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was [[Alan Shearer]], who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a national record of more than £3&amp;nbsp;million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for £15&amp;nbsp;million in 1996. He also scored 30 times for England internationally.

===Southampton in the Premier League (1992–2005)===
Southampton were founding members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992–93, but spent most of the next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In [[1995–96 Southampton F.C. season|1995–96]], Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 3–1 home win over eventual double winners Manchester United, then came a 1–0 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Graeme Souness]], was brought in, signing foreign players such as [[Egil Østenstad]] and [[Eyal Berkovic]]. The highlight of the season was a 6–3 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. However, he had to deal with criticism over the [[Ali Dia (footballer)|Ali Dia]] debacle. He resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] who had won promotion to Division One with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals.

In [[1998–99 Southampton F.C. season|1998–99]], they were rooted to the bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season but again avoided relegation on the last day of the season after a late run of good results, helped by the intervention of Latvian [[Marian Pahars]] and old hero Le Tissier (The so-called "Great Escape"). In 1999, Southampton were given the go-ahead to build a new 32,000-seat stadium in the St Mary's area of the city, having been playing in the Dell since 1898. The stadium had been converted to an all-seater format earlier in the decade, but had a capacity of less than 16,000 and was unsuitable for further expansion.

During the [[1999–2000 Southampton F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], Dave Jones quit as Southampton manager to concentrate on a court case after he was accused of abusing children at the children's home where he had worked during the 1980s. The accusations were later proved to be groundless, but it was too late to save Jones' career as Southampton manager and he was succeeded by ex-England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]]. Hoddle helped keep Southampton well clear of the Premier League drop zone but having received an offer he moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] just before the end of the [[2000–01 Southampton F.C. season|2000–01 season]]. He was replaced by first-team coach [[Stuart Gray (footballer, born 1960)|Stuart Gray]], who oversaw the relocation to the St Mary's Stadium for the 2001–02 season. At the end of the 2000–01 season, in the last competitive match at The Dell, Matthew Le Tissier came on late to score the last ever league goal at the old stadium with a half volley on the turn in a 3–2 win against Arsenal. Gray was sacked after a poor start to the following season, and he was replaced by ex-[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] manager [[Gordon Strachan]], who steered Southampton to safety and a secure 11th-place finish.

In [[2002–03 Southampton F.C. season|2002–03]], Southampton finished eighth in the league and finished [[2003 FA Cup Final|runners-up in the FA Cup]] to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the [[Millennium Stadium]]), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of [[James Beattie (footballer)|James Beattie]], who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two different managers – [[Paul Sturrock]] and [[Steve Wigley]] – had come and gone. Chairman [[Rupert Lowe]] risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed [[Harry Redknapp]] as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at [[South Coast of England|South Coast]] rivals Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saints name Redknapp as boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4077461.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought in a number of new signings, including his son [[Jamie Redknapp|Jamie]] in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager [[Ron Atkinson]] his job.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"/&gt;

Lowe and Southampton continued to make headlines after former [[England national rugby union team|England]] Rugby World Cup-winning coach [[Clive Woodward|Sir Clive Woodward]] joined the club—eventually being appointed technical director in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton confirm Woodward move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4121186.stm|date=22 June 2005|accessdate=30 October 2013|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside the top flight (2005–2012)===
[[File:Before the Kick-off - geograph.org.uk - 431355.jpg|thumb|right|Southampton players form a huddle before kicking off against Derby in 2007]]
In November 2005, manager Harry Redknapp resigned to rejoin Portsmouth, and was replaced by [[George Burley]]. Rupert Lowe resigned as chairman in June 2006, and Jersey-based businessman [[Michael Wilde]], who had become the club's major shareholder assumed the post. Following a club record £6&amp;nbsp;million being spent on transfers, Polish strikers [[Grzegorz Rasiak]] and [[Marek Saganowski]] performed well and the season saw the introduction of 17-year-old [[left back]] [[Gareth Bale]]. Southampton finished in sixth place and lost the play-off semi-final to Derby County on penalties. The board sought new investment in the club, and In February 2007 Wilde stepped down as chairman to be replaced by local businessman [[Leon Crouch]] as "Acting chairman", a role Crouch retained until 21 July 2007. In the [[2007-08 Southampton F.C. season|2007–08 season]], George Burley revealed that players such as Bale and [[Kenwyne Jones]] had to be sold to stop the club going into administration and that failing to achieve promotion had put the club in serious financial difficulty. Burley left the club in January 2008 to take over as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager and was replaced by [[Nigel Pearson]] who saved the club from relegation on the final day.

In July 2008 all the board members except one resigned, allowing Lowe and Wilde to return: Wilde as Chairman of Southampton FC and Rupert Lowe as Chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc. Although Pearson kept the team up, the board did not renew his contract due to financial constraints, and the relatively unknown Dutchman [[Jan Poortvliet]] was appointed manager. Financial troubles continued to mount, resulting in more players being sold or loaned out and parts of St Mary's were closed off to reduce costs. In January 2009, Poortvliet resigned with the club one place from bottom of the Championship, with [[Mark Wotte]] taking over managerial duties.&lt;ref name="Poortvliet resigns"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poortvliet resigns as Saints boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7848414.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=30 October 2013|date=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wotte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/articles/article.php?page_id=11263 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217225957/http://saintsfc.co.uk/articles/article.php?page_id=11263 |archivedate=17 February 2009 |title=Chairman's statement |publisher= Saintsfc.co.uk|date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4073293.Chairman_speaks_about_Jan's_departure/ |title=Chairman speaks about Jan's departure |publisher=''Daily Echo'' |date=24 January 2009|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Southampton's parent company was placed in [[Administration (British football)|administration]]. A ten-point penalty was imposed, but as the team was already being relegated due to finishing second from bottom of the [[Football League Championship]] this points deduction had to apply to the 2009–10 season. By the end of May, the club was unable to meet its staff wages and asked employees to work unpaid as a gesture of goodwill. The administrator warned that the club faced imminent bankruptcy unless a buyer was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1189228/Southampton-crisis-deepens-club-fails-pay-wages-month.html |title=Southampton crisis deepens as club fails to pay wages this month |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, administrator Mark Fry confirmed negotiations with two groups of investors, followed by confirmation that the club had been sold to an overseas buyer "owned and controlled by [[Markus Liebherr]]".&lt;ref name = "Hooray"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4481187.Swiss_Saints_deal_completed/|title=Swiss Saints deal completed|date=8 July 2009|work=Southern Daily Echo|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebherr brought in Italian businessman [[Nicola Cortese]] to look after the club's business interests on his behalf. In July 2009, with the club in the control of the new owner, Wotte was sacked as head coach and [[Alan Pardew]] was appointed as the new First Team Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton appoint Alan Pardew as new manager|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/5849983/Southampton-appoint-Alan-Pardew-as-new-manager.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saints made their first big signing under Liebherr, striker [[Rickie Lambert]], who was purchased on 10 August from League One side [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol Rovers striker Rickie Lambert seals £1m move to Southampton|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-Rovers-striker-Rickie-Lambert-seals-1m-Southampton/story-11246413-detail/story.html|work=Bristol Post|date=10 August 2009|access-date=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021035122/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-Rovers-striker-Rickie-Lambert-seals-1m-Southampton/story-11246413-detail/story.html|archivedate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton started the 2009–10 season in League One, in the third tier of English football for the first time in 50 years and with −10 points. In March 2010, Southampton won their first trophy since 1976 when they defeated [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 4–1 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] to claim the [[2010 Football League Trophy Final|Football League Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8583783.stm|title= Carlisle 1&amp;nbsp;– 4 Southampton|last=Shemilt|first=Stephan|date=28 March 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton finished the season in 7th place, seven points from the last play-off position.

A new home shirt was unveiled on 10 June 2010, in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary. The design was based on the original St. Mary's Y.M.A. kit used in 1885; it featured the new anniversary crest and was without a sponsor's logo.&lt;ref name="echo_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/saints/news/8213663.New_kit_unveiled_by_Saints/ |title=Southampton return to roots with new home kit |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Newsquest Media Group |work=Southern Daily Echo |author=Dan Kerins |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August, it was announced that Liebherr had died; however, the club's future had been assured and planned for before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2119026,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616093727/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2119026,00.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |title=Markus Liebherr of Southampton Football Club |publisher= Southampton FC|date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the Championship for the 2011–12 season, Southampton made their best start to a season for 75 years with a winning run at St. Mary's of 13 league games, setting a new club record and going top of the league. In April 2012, Southampton achieved promotion to the Premier League as runners-up to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. The final game of the season game set a record attendance at St Mary's Stadium of 32,363. Lambert finished the season as the Championship's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, his third "Golden Boot" in four seasons. He also won the Championship Player of the Year award.

===Return to the Premier League (2012–present)===
Southampton returned to the Premier league for season 2012–13 initially under Nigel Adkins. Substantial sums were spent to strengthen the playing squad, but early in the season, Adkins was replaced by Argentine coach [[Mauricio Pochettino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/new-first-team-manager-appointed-606668.aspx |title=New First Team Manager Appointed|publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21079956 |title=Adkins sacked as Southampton boss |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton finished the season in 14th place, and [[2013–14 Premier League|next season]] in 8th.

They once again qualified for the Europa League, although this time immediately entered the group stages, as opposed to the play-off rounds.

In June 2016, Koeman left Southampton to join Everton and [[Claude Puel]] replaced him on a three-year contract. The club were eliminated in the group stage of the Europa League but were more successful in the [[2016-17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]], where they  lost 3–2 in the [[2017 EFL Cup Final|final]] to Manchester United. The club ended the 2016–17 season in eighth. During the summer, Puel was replaced as manager by Argentine coach [[Mauricio Pellegrino]], previously of [[Deportivo Alavés]].

==Stadium and training facilities==
{{Main|St Mary's Stadium|The Dell (Southampton)}}
[[Image:St Mary's Stadium Southampton.jpg|thumb|right|View from the Chapel Stand]]

St Mary's Stadium has been home to the Saints since August 2001. It has a capacity of 32,689&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Mary's Stadium|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/profile.stadium.html/southampton|work=Club profile: Southampton|publisher=The Premier League|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of only a handful of stadia in Europe to meet [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA's Four Star criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/premier-league-stadium-focus-st-marys-stadium-southampton.html |title=Around the grounds: St Mary's Stadium |publisher=Premier League |date=15 July 2013|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has also been host to a number of international games. The ground's record attendance is 32,363, set in a game between Southampton and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Records|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/club/club-records/|website=www.saintsfc.com|publisher=Southampton F.C.|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1898 to 2001, Southampton played their home games at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]]. The purpose-built stadium was redeveloped a number of times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. Following the [[Taylor report]], The Dell was converted to an all-seater stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in England's top-flight, precipitating a move to a new home. Prior to The Dell, the club's home grounds were the [[Antelope Ground]], from 1887 to 1896, and the [[County Ground, Southampton|County Cricket Ground]], from 1896 to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|author2=Holley, Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987| isbn= 0-907969-22-4|pages=216–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's training facilities, [[Staplewood Campus]], are located in [[Marchwood]] on the edge of the [[New Forest]]. The current facilities were opened in November 2014, at a cost of almost £40m.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The main building was named after the club's late owner, [[Markus Liebherr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20141105-markus-liebherr-pavilion-2063443.aspx|title=Saints honour Markus Liebherr's memory at new training centre|work=saintsfc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012–13 season, and for the foreseeable future, the club agreed a deal with [[Eastleigh F.C.]], currently of the [[Conference South]], for the use of their stadium, [[Ten Acres]], for The Saints' U21 team fixtures. This continues a partnership with Eastleigh that has lasted for the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saints &amp; Spitfires Link Up|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/saints-spitfires-link-up-511796.aspx|publisher=Southampton FC|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthem==
The Saints' anthem is the popular sports tune [[When the Saints Go Marching In (sports tune)|When the Saints Go Marching In]], and since the club's official nickname is "the Saints", they are one of only a few teams who do not change the original lyric.

==Crest==
[[Image:Saints logo 2010.PNG|thumb|left|The 125th Anniversary year crest]]

Originally, the club used the same crest as the one used by the city itself. However, during the 1970s a competition was run for fans to design a new one.

The winning design, designed by Rolland Parris, was used for around 20 years, before being modified slightly by Southampton design agency The Graphics Workshop in the 1990s for copyright reasons.

From top-to-bottom, the halo is a reference to the nickname "Saints", the ball to the nature of the club, the scarf to the fans and the team colours. The tree represents the nearby [[New Forest]] and [[Southampton Common]], with the water representing Southampton's connections with the rivers, seas and oceans. Below that is a white rose&amp;nbsp;– the symbol of the city which is also present on the city crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/council-partners/councillorsrepresent/mayorsoffice/thearmsofthecityofsouthampton.aspx |title=The arms of the city of Southampton |publisher=Southampton City Council |accessdate=30 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228035912/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/council-partners/councillorsrepresent/mayorsoffice/thearmsofthecityofsouthampton.aspx |archivedate=28 February 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s the ball was changed from a vintage style ball (such as those used in the 1960s) to the current ball with black and white panels, for copyright reasons.

On 13 May 2010, the official crest for the 125th anniversary was released: "The black outline and halo feature will now appear in gold, whilst the all important years 1885 and 2010 are scripted either side of the shield, with the figure 125 replacing the ball". The badge was used on Southampton's shirts for the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2050978,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405200054/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2050978,00.html |archivedate=5 April 2012 |title=125 Anniversary Crest Unveiled |publisher= Southampton FC|date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Coast derby==
{{Main|South Coast derby}}
The South Coast Derby is the name given to matches between the Saints and their fierce nearby rivals, [[Portsmouth F.C.]], from the city of the [[Portsmouth|same name]], just over 18 miles from Southampton. The matches are also referred to as the Hampshire Derby. Including Southern League games, there have been 70 games between the two clubs, with Southampton winning 34 and Portsmouth 21.
