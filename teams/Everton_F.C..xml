'''Everton Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|v|ər|t|ən}}) is &lt;!--  [[Comparison of American and British English#Grammar|Comparison of American and British English]]--&gt; a [[association football|football]] club in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of [[Football in England|English football]]. The club have competed in the top division for a [[Football records in England#Top-flight appearances|record 116 seasons]], missing the top division [[List of Everton F.C. seasons|only four times]] (1930–31 and three consecutive seasons starting with 1951–52) since [[The Football League]] was created in 1888. Everton have won 15 major trophies: the [[List of English football champions|League Championship]] nine times ([[List of English football champions#Total titles won|fourth most]] as of 2017–18), the [[FA Cup]] five times ([[List of FA Cup Finals#Results by team|ninth most]]) and the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] once.

Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first League Championship [[1890–91 Everton F.C. season|two seasons later]]. Following four League Championship and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period, until a revival in the 1960s, which saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championships, an FA Cup, and the [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985 European Cup Winners' Cup]]. The club's most recent major trophy was the [[1995 FA Cup Final|1995 FA Cup]].

The club's supporters are known as [[Everton F.C. supporters|Evertonians]]. Everton have a rivalry with neighbours [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the two sides contest the [[Merseyside derby]]. The club has been based at [[Goodison Park]] in [[Walton, Liverpool]], since 1892, after moving from [[Anfield]] following a row over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.

Everton were founded as St Domingo FC in 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A brief history of Everton|url = http://www.espnfc.com/story/841078/a-brief-history-of-everton|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gore's Directory 1878"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G968-J8HD?mode=g&amp;cat=241645|title=Gore's Directory 1878|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]] could play sport year round&amp;nbsp;– [[cricket]] was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club.&lt;ref name=stdomingos/&gt; The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.&lt;ref name=stdomingos&gt;{{cite web |title=Club profile: Everton |publisher=Premier League |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/everton|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/05/10/st-domingos |title=St Domingo's – 53.425799°N, 2.964903°W |publisher=Everton F.C. |date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was a founding member of [[the Football League]] in 1888–89 and won their first [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] title in the [[1890–91 Football League|1890–91 season]]. Everton won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1906 FA Cup Final|1906]] and the League Championship again in [[1914–15 Football League|1914–15]]. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Facts About Football in the First World War|url = http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/9-facts-about-football-in-the-first-world-war|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Facts About Football in the Second World War|url = http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-facts-about-football-in-the-second-world-war|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Everton FC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|300px|Chart showing the progress of Everton F.C. through the [[English football league system]] (1888–2017)]]
It was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed [[Dixie Dean]] from [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]. In [[1927–28 Football League|1927–28]], Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1878 to 1930 |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Everton were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in [[1931–32 Football League|1931–32]], Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/21/joy-of-six-promoted-success-stories |title=The Joy of Six: Newly promoted success stories| author=Scott Murray |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eedd.html |title=English Energy and Nordic Nonsense| author=Karel Stokkermans|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton also won their second FA Cup in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] with a 3–0 win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the final. The era ended in [[1938–39 Football League|1938–39]] with a fifth League Championship.&lt;ref name="Football and the First World War"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWfootball.htm |title=Football and the First World War |accessdate=5 November 2011 |publisher=Spartacus Educational |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417080654/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWfootball.htm |archivedate=17 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/everton/1938-1939|title=Everton 1938–1939 : Home|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=statto.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922054339/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/everton/1938-1939|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton were relegated for the second time in [[1950–51 Football League|1950–51]] and did not earn promotion until [[1953–54 Football League|1953–54]], when they finished as runners-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club have been a top-flight presence ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-dixie-years.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113085752/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-dixie-years.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 November 2006 |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1931 to 1960 |publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Everton seasons 1955-2011.png|thumb|Finishing positions in the top flight since 1955]]

Everton's second successful era started when [[Harry Catterick]] was made manager in 1961. In [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]], his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1962/63 Season {{!}} Everton Football Club|url = http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/honours-and-records/championship-wins/196263-season|website = www.evertonfc.com|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1966 FA Cup Final|1966]] the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'A great final&amp;nbsp;– a fantastic comeback'|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30804543|newspaper = BBC|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton again reached the final in [[1968 FA Cup Final|1968]], but this time were unable to overcome [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = West Brom to honour Jeff Astle by wearing replica 1968 FA Cup final kit|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/26/jeff-astle-west-brom-1968-fa-cup-final-replica-kit|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 3 September 2015|first = Press|last = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later in [[1969–70 Football League|1969–70]], Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1969/70 Season {{!}} Everton Football Club|url = http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/honours-and-records/championship-wins/196970-season|website = www.evertonfc.com|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1969/70 SEASON|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/1969/70-season.html|publisher=Everton FC|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any [[silverware (sport)|silverware]] for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in [[1974–75 Football League|1974–75]] under manager Billy Bingham, third in [[1977–78 Football League|1977–78]] and fourth the following season under manager [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]]. Lee was sacked in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-school-of-science.html |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1961 to 1980 |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Kendall]] took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in [[1984 FA Cup Final|1984]] and two League Championships in [[1984–85 Football League|1984–85]] and [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]]. In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985]].&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt; The European success came after first beating [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|University College Dublin]], [[Inter Bratislava]] and [[Fortuna Sittard]]. Then, Everton defeated German giants [[Bayern Munich]] 3–1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club [[Rapid Vienna]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Goodison's greatest night |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/goodison-s-greatest-night.html |accessdate=24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a [[treble (association football)|treble]], but lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup [[1985 FA Cup Final|final]].&lt;ref name="modernhistory" /&gt; The following season, [[1985–86 Football League|1985–86]], Everton were runners-up to neighbours Liverpool in both the League and the [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], but did recapture the League Championship in [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]].

After the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to [[Athletic Bilbao]] after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant [[Colin Harvey (footballer)|Colin Harvey]]. Harvey took Everton to the [[1989 FA Cup Final]], but lost 3–2 after extra time to Liverpool.

Everton were founding members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]], was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player [[Joe Royle]] took over in 1994, the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history by defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the [[1995 FA Cup Final|final]]. The cup triumph was also Everton's passport to the Cup Winners' Cup – their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96]] as they climbed to sixth place in the Premiership.&lt;ref name="modernhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1981 to 2006
|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain [[Dave Watson]].

Howard Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to their superior [[goal difference]] over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Former [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Walter Smith]] then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt; The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and with Everton in real danger of relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everton sack boss Walter Smith |publisher=[[CBBC Newsround]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_1870000/1870925.stm |date=13 March 2002 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His replacement, [[David Moyes]], guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Moyes revive Everton? |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/1868992.stm |date=14 March 2002 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final 2001/2002 English Premier Table |publisher=[[Soccerbase]] |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=7&amp;seasonid=131&amp;teamid=942 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002000812/http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=7&amp;seasonid=131&amp;teamid=942 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=21 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]] Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes' management that [[Wayne Rooney]] broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of £28&amp;nbsp;million in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3616874.stm|title=Rooney deal explained|date=1 September 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth-place finish in [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]] ensured that Everton qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group stage]] and were then eliminated from the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].

At the end of the 2012–13 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

Everton reached the semi-finals of both the [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in 2015–16, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martínez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Andy|title=Roberto Martínez sacked by Everton after disappointing season|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/roberto-martinez-sacked-everton|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added.&lt;ref name=kit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1888-1915.asp |title=Everton history&amp;nbsp;– II: Before World War I (1888–1915) |accessdate=16 November 2007|publisher=Toffeeweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the [[1901–02 in English football|1901–02]] season.&lt;ref name="kit" /&gt; The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]] and [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Everton/Everton.htm|title=Everton|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Historical Football Kits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes. The home goalkeeper attire for the [[2014-15 Everton F.C. season|2014–15]] season was all yellow.

Everton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, black, white, grey and yellow away shirts have been used. The away shirt for the [[2011-12 Everton F.C. season|2011–12]] season was reverted to an amber shirt with navy blue shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2011/05/17/amber-kit-set-to-go-on-sale|title=New Away Kit on Sale|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current away kit is a black shirt with a pink trim, while their third kit is a white shirt with a blue design on the front in the shape of Prince Ruperts Tower.

==Crest==
[[File:Prince Rupert's Tower, Everton FC's Symbol - geograph.org.uk - 72858.jpg|thumb|Since 1938, the local [[Everton Lock-Up]] has featured on Everton's crest]]
At the end of the [[1937–38 in English football|1937–38]] season, Everton secretary [[Theo Kelly]], who later became the club's first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of [[Everton Lock-Up]], which stands in the heart of the [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton district]].&lt;ref name=crest/&gt; The Lock-Up has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a [[village lock-up|bridewell]] to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the [[College of Arms]] in London, Kelly chose to include the [[laurel wreath|laurels]] as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, ''"[[Nil Satis Nisi Optimum]]"'', meaning "Nothing but the best is good enough".&lt;ref name="crest" /&gt; The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the [[1938–39 in English football|1938–39]] season.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Everton crest from official site |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/history-of-the-club-crest.html|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven "EFC" design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold "EFC" lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.

In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown of Elements|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/breakdown-of-elements|publisher=Everton F.C. Official Website |accessdate=25 May 2013|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=May 2013}} suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer [[Nike, Inc.]] that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-fc-fans-disappointment-modern-4019362 | title=Everton fans' disappointment at 'modern, cleaner' Blues badge | work=Liverpool Echo | date=27 May 2013 | accessdate=27 May 2013 | author=Jones, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Adam |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/yournextevertoncrest |title=Next Crest Revealed |publisher=Everton F.C.

==Nickname==
Everton's most widely recognised nickname "The Toffees" or "The Toffeemen", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton village]], between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a [[toffee]] shop that sold sweets including the [[Humbug (sweet)#Everton mints|Everton Mint]]. It was also located opposite the [[Prince Rupert's Tower|lock up]] which Everton's club crest is based on. The Toffee Lady tradition in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named ''Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House'' in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reasons behind the "toffees" nickname |publisher=Toffeeweb |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#Toffees|accessdate=21 August 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060809052249/http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp| archivedate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, Everton were nicknamed "The Black Watch" after the [[Black Watch|famous army regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Everton history&amp;nbsp;– "The Black Watch" |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since going blue in 1901, Everton have been given the simple nickname "The Blues". Everton's attractive style of play led to [[Steve Bloomer]] calling the team "scientific" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname "The School of Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The School of Science |publisher=Toffeeweb |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809052249/http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp |archivedate=9 August 2006|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known as "The Dogs of War". When David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton as "The People's Club", which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton are a better buy than Liverpool, says David Moyes |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Everton-are-a-better-buy-than-Liverpool-says-David-Moyes-article418289.html |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2010|first=Simon|last=Mullock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton originally played in the southeast corner of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at [[Anfield]], which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= I: THE EARLY DAYS (1878–88)|publisher=Toffeeweb|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1878-1888.asp|accessdate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groom|first1=Andy|title=The Illustrated Everton Story|date=2014|publisher=Andrews UK Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Groom"/&gt; A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd". Everton left Anfield for a new ground, [[Goodison Park]], where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by [[The Football Association]]. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool F.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed |publisher=Liverpool FC |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907184403/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |archivedate=7 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-history.asp|title=History of Goodison Park|publisher=Toffeeweb|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. It was also the first English ground to have under soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton firsts |publisher=Everton F.C.|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-firsts.html|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the theme song for ''[[Z-Cars]]'', which is named "[[Theme from Z-Cars|Johnny Todd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'real' story behind Everton's enduring anthem Z-Cars|url = http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-prentice-real-story-behind-7795561|accessdate = 3 September 2015|first = David|last = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a traditional Liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by [[Frank Kidson]] and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny Todd|publisher=feniks.com|url=http://www.feniks.com/skb/music/lull7.html|accessdate=21 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218185904/http://www.feniks.com/skb/music/lull7.html|archivedate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On two separate occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played [[2 Unlimited]]'s song "[[Get Ready For This]]". A month later, the club used a reworking of the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] classic "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]". Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mimms |first=Robert |title=Amateur Dramatics |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/30-Clubs/6382-amateur-dramatics |publisher=When Saturday Comes |date=July 1998 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training facilities===
{{details|Finch Farm}}
From 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at [[Bellefield]] in the [[West Derby]] area of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ghosts-bellefield-part-one-football-3380766 | title=The Ghosts of Bellefield part one: Football history in the making for Everton FC | work=Liverpool Echo | date=22 March 2011 | accessdate=11 March 2015 | author=Prentice, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to the [[Finch Farm]] training complex in [[Halewood]] in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy.

===Proposed new stadia===
There have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000 seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the £30&amp;nbsp;million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/2940481.stm |title=Kings Dock proposal collapse |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 August 2006 |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with [[Liverpool F.C.]] about sharing a proposed stadium on [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton and Liverpool say no to ground share |publisher=icliverpool |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0400evertonfc/0150kingsdock/tm_objectid=15062893%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=both%2dclubs%2dsay%2da%2dfinal%2dno%2dto%2djoint%2dstadium-name_page.html|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own [[Stanley Park Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4164319.stm |title=Merseysiders rule out groundshare |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=17 November 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton entered into talks with the [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley Council]] and [[Tesco]] in June 2006 over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in [[Kirkby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/5083198.stm |title=Everton in talks on stadium move |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2006 |date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan became known as [[The Kirkby Project]]. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59% to 41%.&lt;ref name = "ground trouble"&gt;{{cite news |title=Grounds for discontent at Everton as move hits trouble |work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/21/everton-goodison-kirkby-inquiry |accessdate=23 August 2010 |date=21 January 2009 |last=Conn |first=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool.&lt;ref name = "ground trouble"/&gt; Following a public inquiry into the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/7546148.stm |title=New Everton stadium faces inquiry |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the central government rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/8379839.stm |title=Government reject Everton's Kirkby stadium plans |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an amended rescue plan with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C.

The Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10 February 2011 featured a proposal to open the [[Canada Dock Branch|Bootle Branch line]] using "Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic enablers of the project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://councillors.liverpool.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=10728&amp;T=11 |title=Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10.02.2011 |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid transit [[Merseyrail]] line that would circle the city and ease transport access. In September 2014 the club, working with the [[Liverpool City Council]] and [[Liverpool Mutual Homes]], outlined initial plans to build a new stadium in [[Walton Hall Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/15/everton-new-stadium-walton-hall-park-goodison | title=Everton announce plan for new stadium in nearby Walton Hall Park | work=The Guardian | date=15 September 2014 | accessdate=16 September 2014 | author=Tallentire, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those plans were later scrapped in May 2016 with the prospect of two new sites being identified for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-mayor-says-everton-new-11337859 |title=Liverpool Mayor says Everton will have new stadium 'within three years' | work=Liverpool Echo | date=16 May 2016 | accessdate=19 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, the chairman, Bill Kenwright revealed that [[Bramley-Moore Dock]] was the preferred site for the new stadium, with a new railway station and a new road being funded by the City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Supporters and rivalries==
{{details|Everton F.C. supporters}}
Everton have a large fanbase, with the eighth highest average attendance in the Premier League in the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English Premier League&amp;nbsp;– Attendance&amp;nbsp;– 2009/2010|publisher=ESPN |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance?league=eng.1&amp;year=2009&amp;cc=5739|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the [[North West of England]], primarily [[Merseyside]], Cheshire, [[West Lancashire]] and parts of Western [[Greater Manchester]] along with many fans who travel from [[North Wales]] and Ireland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. Everton also have many supporters' clubs worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Everton Supporters Clubs |publisher=Bluekipper |url=http://www.bluekipper.com/supporters_clubs/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820051903/http://www.bluekipper.com/supporters_clubs/index.html |archivedate=20 August 2006|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in places such as North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton Supporters Clubs (North America) |publisher=Everton USA |url=http://efc-usa.blogspot.com/2013/01/us-everton-fc-supporters-clubs.html|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton Supporters Club (Singapore) |publisher=Singapore Everton Supporters' Club Website |url=http://www.evertonfc.org.sg/ |accessdate=21 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820025641/http://www.evertonfc.org.sg/ |archivedate=20 August 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton Supporters Club of Malaysia |publisher=Everton Supporters Club of Malaysia |url=http://malaysiantoffees.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, India and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everton Official Site|publisher=Everton F.C.|url=http://thai.evertonfc.com/|accessdate=21 August 2006|language=Thai|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820053157/http://thai.evertonfc.com/|archivedate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com.au/php/home|title=Everton Supporters Club Australia|publisher=Everton Supporters Club Australia|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official supporters club is ''FOREVERTON'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FOREVERTON&amp;nbsp;– Official Everton Supporters Club |publisher=Everton F.C.|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/foreverton/|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also several [[fanzine]]s including ''When Skies are Grey'' and ''Speke from the Harbour'', which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.

[[File:Luis Suarez runs at Distin 3.jpg|thumb|[[Merseyside derby]] in 2012, Everton's [[Sylvain Distin]] defending against Liverpool's [[Luis Suárez]]]]
Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for [[North West England]] away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benfica 5&amp;nbsp;– 0 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8318447.stm|accessdate=2 July 2010 | date=22 October 2009 |first=Oliver |last=Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]].

Everton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], against whom they contest the [[Merseyside derby]]. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other [[Local derby|derbies]] in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the [[Hillsborough disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/fans/index.php?id=6|title=Merseyside Derby|publisher=footballderbies.com|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the "friendly derby" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both [[Anfield]] and Goodison Park. Recently on the field, matches tend to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|red cards]] than any other fixture in Premier League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Malam |title= Gerrard off as Reds take derby honours |date=26 March 2006 |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/03/26/sfgliv26.xml |accessdate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2008–09 Everton F.C. season|2008–09]] season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of its main sponsor [[Chang beer]], which followed a recommendation from the [[Portman Group]] that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/everton/article4076141.ece|title=Everton sober up for sake of their young fans|first=James|last=Ducker|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd |work=[[The Times|Times Online]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=29 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton's current kit manufacturers are [[Umbro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg |last=O'Keeffe |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2014/02/04/boss-unveils-new-umbro-partnership |title=Boss unveils new umbro partnership |website=evertonfc.com |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have been the club's kit manufacturer three times previously (1974–83, 1986–2000, and 2004–09).

==Managers==
{{details|List of Everton F.C. managers}}
The club's current manager, [[Marco Silva]], is the seventeenth permanent holder of the position since it was established in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers|title=Managers {{!}} Everton Football Club|website=www.evertonfc.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been [[Harry Catterick]], who was in charge of the team from 1961–73 for 594 first team matches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers|title=History: Managers|website=www.evertonfc.com|publisher=Everton FC|accessdate=29 September 2015|ref=Managers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is [[Howard Kendall]], who won two [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championships, the [[1984 FA Cup Final|1984 FA Cup]], the [[1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], and three [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]]s.

==Records and statistics==
{{details|List of Everton F.C. records and statistics}}
[[File:NevilleSouthall.jpg|thumb|Goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] made a record 751 first-team appearances for Everton between 1981 and 1997]]
[[Neville Southall]] holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain [[Brian Labone]] comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper [[Ted Sagar]], who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]] by American goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]], who ended the season with 17 clean sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/howard-ends-long-search-for-real-no-1-1682619.html |title=Howard ends long search for real No 1 |first=Jon |last=Culley |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |work=The Independent |date=11 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is [[Dixie Dean]]; the second-highest goalscorer is [[Graeme Sharp]] with 159. Dean still holds the [[English football records|English national record]] of most goals in a season with 60.&lt;ref name=records&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/team_records.sd?teamid=942|title=Everton F.C. records|accessdate=16 November 2007|publisher=Soccerbase|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221111720/http://www.soccerbase.com/team_records.sd?teamid=942|archive-date=21 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the [[cornet]] with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]] were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.&lt;ref name=records/&gt; Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the [[Iceland]]ic midfielder [[Gylfi Sigurðsson]] for a sum of £45m in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40848343|title=Gylfi Sigurdsson: Everton sign Swansea midfielder for £45m|date=16 August 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of [[Romelu Lukaku]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was for an initial sum of £75m, a record fee between two English clubs and the largest sum Everton have received for a player.

Everton hold the record for the most seasons in England's top tier (Division One/Premier League), at 114 seasons out of 118 as of 2016–17 (the club played in Division 2 in 1930–31 and from 1951–54). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992&amp;nbsp;– the others being [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England's top flight. As of the 2012–13 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonresults.com/avillasumm.htm|title=Everton Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everton's community department==
Everton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-15729296 |title=Everton FC charity's free school approved |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EitC represents the club in the [[European Multisport Club Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/events/2014/documents/eusf-agenda.pdf|title=Monday, 1 December 2014 / Session 6: Multi-sport clubs |publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club also owned and operated a professional basketball team, by the name of [[Everton Tigers]], who competed in the elite [[British Basketball League]]. The team was launched in the summer of 2007 as part of the club's Community programme and played their home games at the Greenbank Sports Academy. The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968.
