'''Huddersfield Town Association Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club in [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, which competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football.

Huddersfield became the first English club to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926, a feat which only three other clubs have matched. The first two league titles were won under legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]], who also led the club to an [[FA Cup]] win in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]]. In the late 1950s the club was managed by [[Bill Shankly]] and featured [[Denis Law]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]]. Following relegation from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1972, Huddersfield spent 45 years in the second, third and fourth tiers of English football, before returning to the top flight in 2017. 

Nicknamed The Terriers, the club plays in blue and white vertically-striped shirts and white shorts. They play their home games at the [[Kirklees Stadium]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Huddersfield Town A.F.C.}}

[[File:Huddersfield Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|Chart showing the progress of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]In 1910, just three years after being founded, Huddersfield entered [[the Football League]] for the first time. In November 1919 a fund-raising campaign was needed to avoid a move to [[Leeds]]. Citizens of Huddersfield were asked to buy shares in the club for £1 each, and the club staved off the proposed merger. The team went on to reach the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] and win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]].

Huddersfield became the first English team to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926 – a feat that only three other clubs ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) have been able to match – and was achieved under the leadership of legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]] and his successor [[Cecil Potter]]. Huddersfield Town also won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]] and the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] the same year and have been runners-up on four other occasions in the FA Cup. During the club's heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, they achieved a record attendance of 67,037 on 27 February 1932 during their FA Cup 6th round tie against Arsenal at [[Leeds Road]]. This attendance has been bettered by only 13 other clubs in the history of the Football League.

After the [[Second World War]], the club began a gradual decline, losing its [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status in [[1951–52 Football League|1952]]. They came straight back up, but were relegated again three seasons later. Before the start of the [[1969–70 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1969–70]] season, Huddersfield Town adopted the nickname "''The Terriers''". They won the Second Division title that season, spending the next two seasons in the top flight. After that they moved up and down through the lower three divisions for 45 years.

In 1998, the club attracted the attention of local businessman Barry Rubery and, after protracted takeover talks, he took over the running of the club, promising significant investment as the club sought [[Premier League|Premiership]] status. However, the club did not make it back to the top flight and fell two divisions. The club was sold by Rubery to David Taylor and under Taylor's ownership, slipped into administration. In the summer of 2003, the Terriers came out of administration under the new ownership of [[Ken Davy]].

In [[2010–11 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2010–11]], Huddersfield went 43 games unbeaten, the second-highest in the league after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] 49-match run of 2003–04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Huddersfield's record run ends after 43 matches |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-huddersfield/huddersfields-record-run-ends-after-43-matches-idUKTRE7AS0HS20111129 |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2012, following a penalty shoot-out in the [[2012 Football League One play-off Final]] victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Huddersfield were promoted to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. The shoot-out was the longest contested in the current League One play-offs format. After eleven rounds, the final score was 8–7 to Huddersfield, with the winning goal being scored by goalkeeper [[Alex Smithies]].

In November 2015, German-born ex-[[United States men's national soccer team|US international]] [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] was appointed head coach, becoming the first person born outside the [[British Isles]] to manage the club in their 107-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Wagner named new Huddersfield Town head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34733422 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2017, the club successfully earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time (since the rebranding in 1992) and the English top flight for the first time since [[1971–72 Football League|1972]], beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 4–3 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time in the [[2017 EFL Championship play-off Final|Championship play-off Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Huddersfield Town 0 -0 Reading (4-3 Pens) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39995791 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2018, the club secured safety from relegation, earning another season in the Premier League, following a 1–1 draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and went on to place 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chelsea 1–1 Huddersfield Town | author =  | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 9 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 May 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180508144829/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-date = 8 May 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club suffered a very poor start to the following season - with them taking just 2 wins in 22 matches. With the team rooted to the bottom of the table with just 11 points on the board, Wagner left the club by mutual consent on 14 January 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46864005|title=David Wagner: Huddersfield Town manager leaves club by mutual consent|date=14 January 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced with former [[Borussia Dortmund II]] manager [[Jan Siewert]] on a 2 year deal. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46943388&lt;/ref&gt;

==Badge and colours==
The club spent over five years debating what colour the kit should be. It ranged from [[salmon pink]] to plain white or all-blue to white with blue [[yoke]]. Eventually in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1913–14|1913]], the club adopted the blue-and-white jersey that remains to this day.

The club badge is based on the [[coat of arms]] of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] based on the local Huddersfield Corporation coat of arms. It appeared again with a [[Yorkshire Rose]] for the [[1922 FA Cup Final]] and again for the finals of [[1928 FA Cup Final|1928]], [[1930 FA Cup Final|1930]] and [[1938 FA Cup Final|1938]]. The club's main [[color|colours]] (blue and white) are evident throughout the badge both in the [[mantling]] and in the [[shield]], in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire White Roses and [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]] form part of the history of the club and the area.

Town stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966–67|1966]], when [[Scotland|Scottish]] manager [[Tom Johnston (footballer)|Tom Johnston]] introduced all-blue shirts. The next badge did not feature until the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966–67|1966–67 season]], when the simple "HTFC" adorned the Town's all-blue shirts.

When the club adopted the nickname "The Terriers" for the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1969–70|1969–70 season]], the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words "The Terriers", just in time for their promotion to the big time, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The [[Yorkshire terrier|terrier]] sits on top of the crest with a [[ball]] on a blanket of blue and white stripes. The Terriers was introduced to the badge shortly after "The Terriers" was adopted as the nickname and [[mascot]] of the club.

After relegation to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], Town returned to all-blue shirts with the return of Tom Johnston in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975–76|1975]]. This time they only lasted two seasons and the return of simply "HTFC" badge. This lasted from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975–76|1975]]–[[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1976–77|1977]]. Stripes returned from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1977–78|the 1977–78 season]] and has been the club's home kit ever since. The red Terrier returned to the shirt for [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1978–79|the 1978–79 season]]. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today based on the coat of arms of Huddersfield. This is both the club badge and playing shirt badge and is held in high esteem by Town fans.

In 2000, Town changed badge to a circular design, but that was never popular and following a change of board, returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small but significant adaptation in February 2005. The club took the decision to remove "A.F.C." from the text leaving only the wording 'Huddersfield Town'. The current board said that this was in keeping with the time and to make merchandise easier to produce and to make slicker looking promotional material.

==Rivals==
{{main article|West Yorkshire derby}}

[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] are considered to be the club's main rivals, with Huddersfield having the better head-to-head record of the two teams. Huddersfield have won 32 of the 78 derbies between the two sides with 19 draws and 27 Leeds wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=1524&amp;team2_id=1309|title=Bet on Leeds vs Huddersfield {{!}} Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516103500/http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=1524&amp;team2_id=1309|archive-date=16 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huddersfield's other local rivals are [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]; this is due to both clubs having had roughly the same league status for the last couple of decades and therefore it could be argued that they are closest rivals out of the three West Yorkshire teams.  Huddersfield also have the better head-to-head record between between the two, winning 21 derbies with 17 draws and 14 Bradford wins.

There are smaller rivalries with [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] (31 wins, 15 draws, 26 defeats), [[A62 Derby|Roses]] rivals [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] (20 wins, 15 draws, 12 defeats) and formerly with near neighbours [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] (8 wins, 5 draws, 4 defeats).  [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] were also once considered rivals during the time that the two clubs were competing in the old First Division - Manchester City lead in the head-to-heads, however, with 27 victories to Huddersfield's 22, with 30 drawn games between them.
