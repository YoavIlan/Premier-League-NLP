'''Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən|...|ˈ|h|oʊ|v}} is a professional [[association football|football]] club from [[Brighton]] based in [[Falmer]], East Sussex, England. They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. Brighton's home ground is the 30,750-capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/26683559 |title=Brighton ground at capacity - Barber |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falmer Stadium]].

Founded in 1901, and nicknamed the "Seagulls" or "[[Albion]]", Brighton played their early professional football in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], before being elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.

By the late 1990s, Brighton had slipped to the fourth tier of English football and were in financial trouble. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016–17 EFL Championship|2016–17 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.

==History==
{{recentism|date=May 2018}}
{{main|History of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.}}
[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] – having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton &amp; Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in bottom place.

Despite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2–2 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. This was the final that featured the "miss" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well known phrase "...and Smith must score".  However, Smith's kick was actually saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4–0.

After four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.

By the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] – the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.

The sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999–2000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000–01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions – winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].

During May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who had successfully secured £93&amp;nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and secured 75% shareholding at the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009. Retrieved 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton's final season at [[Withdean Stadium|Withdean]] was 2010–11, in which they won League One. The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.

The [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2–1 to Albion. The 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On the final day of the 2013–14 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2–1 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, García resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypiä]] was appointed manager for the 2014–15 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3–0 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1–1 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.

Brighton started 2016–17 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2–1 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2–1 Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the current club record signing of [[José Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over £13&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season and never really being threatened with relegation, despite going on a run of 1 win in 12 games and falling to within a point of the drop zone. However they were able to recover, beating the likes of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to finish the season in 15th, seven points above the relegation zone.

==Stadium==
===Goldstone Ground===
[[File:Goldstone Ground - geograph-1220106.jpg|thumb|[[Goldstone Ground]] (1902–1997)]]
For 95 years Brighton and Hove Albion were based at the [[Goldstone Ground]] in [[Hove]], until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by majority shareholder [[Bill Archer (businessman)|Bill Archer]] and his chief executive [[David Bellotti]], proved controversial, and the move provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received little if any money from this sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html |title=Club in Crisis Brighton |publisher=Club in Crisis |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926121254/http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their last season at the Goldstone, [[1996-97 Football League|1996–97]], the Seagulls were in danger of relegation from the [[The Football League|Football League]]. They won their final game at the Goldstone against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10329~2360994,00.html |title=WELCOME – BRIGHTON &amp; HOVE ALBION |publisher=Doncaster Rovers F.C. |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519122819/http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10329~2360994%2C00.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up a winner-takes-all relegation game at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], who were level on points with the Seagulls. Brighton drew 1–1, and Hereford were relegated to the [[Football Conference]] on goals scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4SyMPHlwn8|title=WE ARE STAYING UP|via=YouTube|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdean Stadium===
For two years, from 1997 to 1999, the club shared [[Priestfield Stadium]], the ground of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], before returning to Brighton to play at [[Withdean Stadium]]. This is not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a [[zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpmcollections.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/withdean-stadium/|title=Withdean Stadium|publisher=Royal Pavilion &amp; Brighton Museums|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the cost of the public enquiry into planning permission for a new stadium, rent on [[Withdean Stadium]], fees paid to use [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham's]] [[Priestfield Stadium]], and a general running deficit due to the low ticket sales inherent with a small ground, the club had an accumulated deficit of £9.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2004. The board of directors paid £7&amp;nbsp;million of this; the other £2.5&amp;nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falmer Stadium===
[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]

On 28 October 2005 the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton &amp; Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.

Building of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 12 years without a home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite.&lt;ref name=expansionjan12&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9446804.Albion_s___36_million_plans_to_push_for_Premiership/ |title=Albion's £36&amp;nbsp;million plans to push for Premiership |accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Argus|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was granted unanimously by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012. The stadium was then expanded to 27,250 for the start of the 2012–13 season and then further to 27,750 during December 2012 before reaching 30,750 during May 2013.
