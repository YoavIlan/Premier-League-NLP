'''Manchester City Football Club''' is a [[association football|football]] club based in [[Manchester]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as '''St. Mark's (West Gorton)''', it became '''Ardwick Association Football Club''' in 1887 and '''Manchester City''' in 1894. The club's home ground is the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at [[Maine Road]] since 1923.

Manchester City entered the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1899, and won their first major honour with the [[FA Cup]] in [[1904 FA Cup Final|1904]]. It had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Malcolm Allison]]. After losing the [[1981 FA Cup Final]], the club went through a period of decline, culminating in [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the third tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, Manchester City was purchased in 2008 by [[Abu Dhabi United Group]] for £210&amp;nbsp;million and received considerable financial investment. 

The club won the Premier League in [[2011–12 Premier League|2012]], [[2013–14 Premier League|2014]] and, most recently in [[2017–18 Premier League|2018]], also becoming the first Premier League team to [[Premier_League_records_and_statistics#Points|attain 100 points]] in a single season. Manchester City's revenue was the [[Deloitte Football Money League|fifth highest]] of a football club in the world in the 2017–18 season at €527.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html|title=Deloitte Football Money League 2018|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-20-most-popular-rich-list-football-teams-on-social-media-2018-8/#10-manchester-city-493-million-followers-11 UK Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|fifth most valuable]] in the world at $2.47&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/06/12/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2018/#3dddb7c845c8|title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2018|last=Ozanian|first=Mike|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 1–0 at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] to win the [[FA Cup]]; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup [[Double (association football)|double]] that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p32&lt;/ref&gt;
In the seasons following the [[FA Cup]] triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain [[Billy Meredith]], who subsequently moved across town to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester:The Greatest City'', pp 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at [[Maine Road]] in [[Moss Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Maine Road through the ages |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/3011895.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2003 |accessdate=10 September 2011 |first=Chris |last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke the record for the [[Record home attendances of English football clubs|highest home attendance of any club in English football history]], as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1934 – a record which still stands to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup special: Thrills, spills and a cast of thousands at Maine Road |last=James |first=Gary |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1418817_fa-cup-special-thrills-spills-and-a-cast-of-thousands-at-maine-road?order=liked#comments |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175959/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1418817_fa-cup-special-thrills-spills-and-a-cast-of-thousands-at-maine-road?order=liked |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=England 1937/38| work=league table from RSSSF | url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1937-38.html| accessdate=29 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the [[Revie Plan]] reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and won the second. The [[1956 FA Cup Final|1956 final]], in which Manchester City beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 3–1, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper [[Bert Trautmann]] continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann – The Biography'', pp. 178–184&lt;/ref&gt;

After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in January 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1965, the management team of [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Malcolm Allison]] was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in [[Mike Summerbee]] and [[Colin Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Penney, ''Manchester City – The Mercer-Allison Years'', pp. 27–36&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later, in [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68]], Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 win at Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, ''Manchester City – The Mercer-Allison Years'', pp. 37–56&lt;/ref&gt; Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in [[1969 FA Cup Final|1969]], before achieving European success by winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1970, beating [[Górnik Zabrze]] 2–1 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, ''The Manchester City Football Book No. 2'', pp. 13–22&lt;/ref&gt; City also won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] that season, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.

The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', pp. 410–420&lt;/ref&gt; One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player [[Denis Law]] scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Other results meant United would have been relegated even if they had won or drawn, but neither team knew this at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.

[[File:ManchesterCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|300px|Chart of yearly table positions of City in the Football League.]]
A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on unsuccessful signings, such as [[Steve Daley]].&lt;ref&gt;Tossell, ''Big Mal'', Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of [[Peter Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the [[Premier League]] upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three seasons of struggle before being relegated in 1996.  After two seasons in Division One, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third league tier, after [[1. FC Magdeburg]] of Germany.

After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] introducing greater fiscal discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Andy |author2=Burgess, Richard |title=Blue Moon Rising: The Fall and Rise of Manchester City |publisher=Milo |location=Bury |year=2000 |isbn=0-9530847-4-4}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Under manager [[Joe Royle]], City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. [[Kevin Keegan]] replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]] Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester City – The Complete Record, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]] was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a [[Manchester derby|derby]] win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/1109/manchester.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219015810/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/1109/manchester.htm |archivedate=19 December 2007 |title= Goater double gives City derby win | accessdate=28 May 2007 |work=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt; City also qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years. In the 2003 close season, the club moved to the new [[City of Manchester Stadium]]. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] became the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6241052.stm|title=Eriksson named Man City manager|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=Eriksson's reign at Man City ends|publisher=BBC Sport|date = 2 June 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7430827.stm|accessdate =2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksson was replaced by [[Mark Hughes]] two days later on 4 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By 2008, the club was in a financially precarious position. [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] had taken control of the club a year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin Shinawatra's crisis ends Manchester City's European dream |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/2548558/Thaksin-Shinawatras-crisis-ends-Manchester-Citys-European-dream-Football.html |work=Daily Telegraph |date=12 August 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2010 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Winrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in August 2008, the club was purchased by the [[Abu Dhabi United Group]]. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] [[Robinho]] from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for £32.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Robinho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7593026.stm|title=Man City beat Chelsea to Robinho|publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2008|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There wasn't a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100&amp;nbsp;million on players [[Gareth Barry]], [[Roque Santa Cruz]], [[Kolo Touré]], [[Emmanuel Adebayor]], [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Joleon Lescott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8216645.stm|title=Lescott completes Man City move |date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by [[Roberto Mancini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8422676.stm|title= Mark Hughes sacked as Man City appoint Mancini manager|accessdate=19 December 2009|date=19 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League, and competed in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in season [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]].
[[File:Manchester City pitch invasion.JPG|thumb|254x254px|Manchester City [[Manchester City F.C. supporters|supporters]] [[Pitch invasion|invade the pitch]] following their [[2011–12 Premier League]] title win.]]
Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the [[2011 FA Cup Final]], their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 1 – 0 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9457489.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the [[1976 Football League Cup Final|1976 League Cup]]. In the same week, the club qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time since 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 1 – 0 Tottenham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9480251.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.

Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at [[White Hart Lane]] and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Man City's title win really the best Premier League moment ever?

The following season City failed to capitalise on the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated [[Wigan Athletic A.F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=REVEALED: Bitter dressing room battles that sealed the fate of preening Mancini |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2326322/Roberto-Mancini-revealed-The-Manchester-City-dressing-room-battles-sacking.html |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini: Manchester City sack manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22507128 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[BBC Sports Editor]] David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini: Man City exit because of poor relationships |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22523981 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his place was appointed the Chilean [[Manuel Pellegrini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manuel Pellegrini: Manchester City appoint Chilean as manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22909811 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pellegrini's first season, City [[2014 Football League Cup Final|won the League Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Pete|title=Capital One Cup final: Manchester City win Capital One Cup after beating Sunderland 3–1|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/307826/report|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=[[Sky Sports News]]|date=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regained the Premier League title on the last day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City crowned Premier League champions with 2–0 victory over West Ham|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/287660/report|accessdate=11 May 2014|work=[[Sky Sports]]|date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester City won the [[2017–18 Premier League]] title. The club had the highest point total in Premier League history and broke numerous Club and English league records in that season. That season, they also won the [[2017-18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]], and won it the season [[2018-19 EFL Cup|after]], which was the first time in Manchester City history that the club retained a major trophy.
[[Pep Guardiola]], former manager of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], is the current manager, who has been in charge since the dismissal of Pellegrini in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/manchester-city/382/blog/post/3333011/can-man-city-smash-the-premier-league-points-and-goals-records|title=Man City smash 11 Premier League records|publisher=ESPN|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club badge and colours ==
[[File:A6-EYE (14077630048).jpg|thumb|240px|right|Manchester City's [[City of Manchester stadium|stadium]] and shirt have been sponsored by [[Etihad Airways]] since 2009.]]
Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several different colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled ''Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City'' published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager [[Malcolm Allison]], who believed that adopting the colours of [[A.C. Milan]] would inspire City to glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Nicking the shirts off their backs| work=The Guardian| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1643916,00.html| accessdate=18 December 2006 | location=London | first=Georgina | last=Turner | date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allison's theory worked, with City winning the [[1969 FA Cup Final]], [[1970 League Cup Final]] and the [[1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.

City have previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the [[City of Manchester]] are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club.&lt;ref&gt;David Clayton, ''Everything Under the Blue Moon'' (Mainstream Publishing, 2002), 21&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City History | url=http://mcivta.com/history/ | accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the city of [[Manchester]], and consisted of a shield in front of a [[golden eagle]]. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but has since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield features a ship on its upper half representing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolise the city's three rivers – the [[River Irwell|Irwell]], the [[River Irk|Irk]] and the [[River Medlock|Medlock]]. The bottom of the badge bears the motto "''Superbia in Proelio''", which translates as "Pride in Battle" in [[Latin]]. Above the eagle and shield are three stars, which are purely decorative.

On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/2016/07/02/mcfc-new-badge-is-here/1467452088949 |title=City's New Badge is Here! |work=mancity.com |date=2 July 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manchester City to design new badge following consultation with fans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/24/manchester-city-badge-design-fans-consultation |work=The Guardian |date=24 November 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|IPO]] when the design was trademarked on 22 December.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237 | title=Manchester City's new club badge design leaked online | publisher=BBC News| date=24 December 2015 | accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 December 2015 |accessdate=26 December 2015 |work=The Guardian |title=Manchester City unveil new club crest before home game against Sunderland |first=Niall |last=McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/26/manchester-city-unveil-new-club-crest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters ==
{{main|Manchester City F.C. supporters}}
Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester City's average attendances have been in the top six in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Top 30 English Football Clubs by League Attendances| work=footballeconomy.com attendance table 2002–2005 | url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_att_04.htm| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then Division Two, now [[EFL League One|Football League One]]), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer than 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Average Attendances – English Football Divisions – 1994/95–2004/05| work=footballeconomy.com division attendance table 1995–2005 | url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_att_01.htm| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and the club's recent trophies, that figure has ballooned to many times that size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Customer Success – Manchester City Football Club| work=Hewlett-Packard case study| url=http://h20219.www2.hp.com/services/cache/78471-0-0-225-121.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125201443/http://h20219.www2.hp.com/services/cache/78471-0-0-225-121.html| archivedate=25 November 2005| accessdate=4 April 2007 }} (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed from a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About MCFC Supporters Club| work=MCFC Supporters Club| url=http://mcfcsupportersclub.co.uk/about/| accessdate=19 April 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030214303/http://mcfcsupportersclub.co.uk/about/| archive-date=30 October 2016| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several [[fanzine]]s published by supporters; the longest running is ''[[King of the Kippax]]'' and it is the only one still published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King of the Kippax fanzine |url=http://kingkippax.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=13 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708045305/http://kingkippax.blogspot.com/ |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of "[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results "typical City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FA Cup preview| work=ESPN Star article| url=http://www.espnstar.com/facup/facup_gamedetails_1660559.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219190036/http://www.espnstar.com/facup/facup_gamedetails_1660559.html| archivedate=19 December 2007| accessdate=24 September 2009 }} (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Typical City!|work=Unofficial supporters homepage|url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/typical.html| accessdate=25 March 2006 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060111201056/http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/typical.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events that fans regard as "typical City" include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace|first=Dave |title=Century City – Manchester City Football Club 1957/58 |publisher=King of the Kippax |year=2007 |location=Leigh |isbn=978-0-9557056-0-1}} page ix&lt;/ref&gt; or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], a team two divisions lower.

Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], against whom they contest the [[Manchester derby]]. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves "supporters" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester [[postcode]] areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do You Come From Manchester? |work=Manchester Metropolitan University study |url=http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227194327/http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Man City also has a rivalry with that of [[Everton F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitterandblue.sbnation.com/2015/8/21/9185653/everton-manchester-city-a-historical-look|title=Everton – Manchester City: A Historical Look|website=Sb Nation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing [[inflatable]] objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the craze is that in a match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] chants from fans calling for the introduction of [[Imre Varadi]] as a substitute mutated into "Imre Banana". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]] as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at [[Grimsby Town]]), with the phenomenon reaching a peak at City's match at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 26 December 1988, a match declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Inflatables Craze| work=Manchester City Football Club Supporters' Homepage | url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/bananas.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990423121549/http://www.uit.no/mancity/bananas.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=23 April 1999| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed [[The Poznań]], from fans of Polish club [[Lech Poznań]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Poles apart: how fans of Poznan inspired City's unlikely dance craze |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/poles-apart-how-fans-of-poznan-inspired-citys-unlikely-dance-craze-2270018.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011  |first=Jack |last=Pitt-Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership and finances ==
{{main|Manchester City F.C. ownership and finances}}

The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a [[private limited company]], with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.

Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),&lt;ref name="PLUS"&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City plc| work=PLUS Markets Group | url=http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/details.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336| accessdate=30 April 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205055003/http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/details.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=5 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6277502.stm |title=Thaksin completes Man City buyout |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=6 July 2007 | date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares, and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to "squeeze out" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Oak Chinnawat]] also became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] executive [[Garry Cook (CEO)|Garry Cook's]] appointment as executive chairman in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/10/manchestercity.premierleague|title=Wardle quits City|work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate=28 August 2008  | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | date=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which accounts were published as a public company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City's losses trebled under Thaksin Shinawatra| work=The Telegraph | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/5137361/Manchester-Citys-losses-trebled-under-Thaksin-Shinawatra.html| accessdate =19 April 2017 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL0287604320070802 |title=Eriksson continues Man City spending |agency=Reuters   | accessdate=13 January 2008 | date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending in around £30&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=563047.html |title=Bojinov joins Man City |publisher=FIFA | accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas over the previous few seasons net spending had been among the lowest in the division. A year later, this investment was itself dwarfed by larger sums. On 1 September 2008, [[Abu Dhabi]]-based [[Abu Dhabi United Group|Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited]] completed a takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200&amp;nbsp;million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer "deadline-day" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to [[gazump]] [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s protracted bid to sign [[Dimitar Berbatov]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee in excess of £30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;

Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed [[Robinho]] from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for a [[Progression of British football transfer record|British record transfer fee]] of £32.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;
