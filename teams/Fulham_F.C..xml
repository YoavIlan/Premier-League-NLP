'''Fulham Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|l|ə|m}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Fulham]], [[West London (sub-region)|West London]], England. Founded in 1879, they currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football, following their promotion from the [[EFL Championship]] in the [[2017–18 EFL Championship|2017–18]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27310805 |work=BBC News |title=Fulham's relegation and the curse of Michael Jackson's statue |date=7 May 2014 |access-date=20 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728133206/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27310805 |archive-date=28 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the oldest football team from London to play in the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;1879 according to the [http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/july/01/moments-that-made-ffc club history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113005617/http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/july/01/moments-that-made-ffc |date=13 November 2013 }} on the official website and 1886/7 {{cite web |url=http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018085447/http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |archivedate=18 October 2009 }} according to 'How a church's cricket and football club became Fulham Football Club' – Morgan Phillips 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has spent 27 seasons in English football's top division, the majority of these in two spells during the 1960s and 2000s. The latter spell was associated with former chairman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], after the club had climbed up from the fourth tier in the 1990s. Fulham have never won a major honour, although they have reached two major finals: in 1975, as a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] team, they contested the [[1975 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] for the only time in their history, losing 2–0 to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], and in 2010 they reached the final of the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]], which they contested with [[Atlético Madrid]] in [[Hamburg]], losing 2–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/overview/index.html#200910+atletico+crown+historic+campaign |title=2009/10: Atlético crown historic campaign – |publisher=UEFA.com |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101062354/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/overview/index.html#200910+atletico+crown+historic+campaign |archive-date=1 January 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1879–98: Formation===
[[File:Fulham team from 1886 season.jpg|thumb|right|The Second XI team, in 1886]]
Fulham were formed in 1879 as '''Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School F.C.''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018085447/http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |archivedate=18 October 2009}}, Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School&lt;/ref&gt; founded by worshipers (mostly adept at cricket) at the [[Church of England]] on Star Road, [[Kensington|West Kensington]] (St Andrew's, Fulham Fields). Fulham's mother church still stands today with a plaque commemorating the team's foundation. They won the West London Amateur Cup in 1887 and, having shortened the name from Fulham Excelsior to its present form in 1888, they then won the [[West London League]] in 1893 at the first attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Sir_Leslie_Bowker.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183209/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Sir_Leslie_Bowker.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the club's first ever kits was half red, half white shirts with white shorts worn in the [[1886–87 in English football|1886–87 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History (Dennis Turner, 2004)''. This is the first kit known, and sock colours are not specified.&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham started playing at their current ground at [[Craven Cottage]] in 1896, their first game against now defunct rivals [[Minerva F.C.|Minerva]]. Fulham are one of the oldest established clubs in southern England currently playing professional football, though there are many non-league sides like Kent side [[Cray Wanderers F.C.|Cray Wanderers]] who are several decades older.

[[File:Image of fulham squad c.1903.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of the 1903–04 line-up]]
The club gained professional status on 12 December 1898, the same year that they were admitted into the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Second Division. They were the second club from London to turn professional, following [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], then named Royal Arsenal 1891. They adopted a red and white kit during the [[1900–01 in English football|1900–01 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History'' (Dennis Turner, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1902–03 in English football|1902–03]], the club won promotion from this division, entering the [[Southern Football League|Southern League First Division]]. The club's first recorded all-white club kit came in 1903, and ever since then the club has been playing in all-white shirts and black shorts, with socks going through various evolutions of black and/or white, but are now normally white-only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History'' (Dennis Turner, 2004) amongst other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The club won the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] twice, in 1905–06 and 1906–07.

===1907–49: Football League===
[[File:Rabbit Hutch at the Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The "Rabbit Hutch" stand along Stevenage Road sometime before [[Archibald Leitch]]'s redesign in 1904–05]]
Fulham joined [[The Football League]] after the second of their Southern League triumphs. The club's first league game, playing in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]'s [[1907–08 in English football#Second Division|1907–08 season]], saw them lose 1–0 at home to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in September 1907. The first win came a few days later at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s [[Baseball Ground]] by a score line of 1–0. Fulham finished the season three points short of promotion in fourth place. The club progressed all the way to the semi-final of that season's [[FA Cup]], a run that included an 8–3 away win at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. In the semi-final, however, they were heavily beaten, 6–0, by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game.&lt;ref&gt;See the FA Cup-specific page in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501164543/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/FACupHistory/RemarkableFailure.aspx club history] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the [[1909–10 in English football|1909–10 season]]. Fulham's first season in Division Two turned out to be the highest that the club would finish for 21 years, until in [[1927–28 in English football|1927–28]] when the club were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|3rd Division South]], created in 1920. [[Hussein Hegazi]], an Egyptian forward, was one of the first non-British players to appear in The Football League, though he only played one game for Fulham in 1911, marked with a goal, afterwards playing for non-league [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Decades_of_progress_since_Hodgson_played_in_South_Africa.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183556/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Decades_of_progress_since_Hodgson_played_in_South_Africa.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, businessman and politician [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. When he rejected an offer from businessman [[Gus Mears]] to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal. Fulham became the first British team to sell [[hot dog]]s at their ground in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbHohM1rfY|title=Fulham hot dog 1926|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220014506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbHohM1rfY|archive-date=20 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham had several high-profile international players during the 1920s, including [[Len Oliver (footballer)|Len Oliver]] and [[Albert Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYuQEh9XxEQ|title=Craven Cottage.1929|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218010859/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYuQEh9XxEQ|archive-date=18 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FulhamFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Yearly performance of Fulham in the Football League]]

After finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the Third Division South, Fulham won the division in the [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32 season]]. In doing so they beat [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] 10–2, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The [[1932–33 in English football|next season]] they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the [[1935–36 in English football|1935–36 season]]. Fulham were also to draw with Austria in 1936 before [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olxwhn0r1WU|title=FULHAM V AUSTRIA 1934|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.

League and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national [[Football League War Cup]] and a [[London War Cup]] up for grabs. Craven Cottage was used like many grounds for fitness and training of the army youth reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6J5sWaLBlk|title=Craven Cottage.1940|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215051911/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6J5sWaLBlk|archive-date=15 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for [[1946–47 in English football|1946–47]]. In [[1948–49 in English football|the third season]] of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win-loss-draw record of 24–9–9 (identical to that which won them the Third Division South 17 years previously). [[John Fox Watson]] made a pioneering transfer to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 1948, becoming one of the first players from the [[United Kingdom]] to sign for a high-profile side abroad.

===1949–69: First Division Cottagers===
Promotion to the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the [[1951–52 in English football|1951–52 season]], winning only eight of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Delorimier Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] in front of 29,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm|title=Celtic Programmes Online – Tours of the USA and Canada|publisher=|access-date=19 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905122656/http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm|archive-date=5 September 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Canada_and_the_USA.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183406/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Canada_and_the_USA.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few seasons of mediocrity in the Second Division followed, but then the club reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1958 and used this momentum to win promotion back to the First Division in the [[1958–59 in English football|following season]], having finished second to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Also joining Fulham in 1958 was [[Graham Leggat]], who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, (making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer). In the [[1959–60 in English football|1959–60 season]], they achieved tenth position in the First Division, which until finishing ninth in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 season]] was their highest-ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.
By this time, the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at Craven Cottage,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx club history] at the official website&lt;/ref&gt; despite struggling in the League.

The club experienced several close escapes from relegation, none more spectacular than in [[1965–66 in English football|1965–66]], when the club rooted at the bottom went on an astounding run beating all the top sides with a few games to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JNj-Gg77rQ|title=Fulham V Liverpool 1966|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=17 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218000839/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JNj-Gg77rQ|archive-date=18 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham had just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually, however, the club suffered relegation in the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]], having won just ten out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only seven in 42, the club were again relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. (Note that this is not the same as the Third Division South, as the regional Third Divisions had been removed with the 1959 creation of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]).

Possibly the single most influential character in Fulham's history is [[Johnny Haynes]].&lt;ref&gt;This is of course somewhat subjective, but he is the first player mentioned in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx Great names] section of the club's history on the official website. He is also the only ex-player to have a stand at [[Craven Cottage]] named after him&lt;/ref&gt; "Mr. Fulham" or "The Maestro," as Haynes later came to be known, signed for The Cottagers as a schoolboy in 1950, making his first team debut on Boxing Day 1952 against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at Craven Cottage. Haynes played for another 18 years, notching 657 appearances (along with many other club records too), his last appearance for Fulham coming on 17 January 1970. He is often considered as the greatest player in Fulham history,&lt;ref&gt;He is the first player listed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx great names] section of the club's history on the official website, and was voted as Fulham's number one all-time [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353562.stm 'Cult Hero'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519092610/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353562.stm |date=19 May 2009 }} in a [[BBC]] poll&lt;/ref&gt; and never played for another team in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;He played for [[Durban City F.C.|Durban City]] after leaving Fulham according to [https://archive.is/20081206183009/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/ThenAndNow_JohnnyHaynes.htm The FA]&lt;/ref&gt; He gained 56 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for England (22 as captain),&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/H/Johnny-Haynes his profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113002948/http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/H/Johnny-Haynes |date=13 November 2013 }} at [[The Football Association|the FA]].&lt;/ref&gt; with many being earned while playing for Fulham in the Second Division. Haynes was injured in a car accident in [[Blackpool]] in 1962, but by his own admissions never regained the fitness or form to play for England again, missing out on England's victory in the [[FIFA World Cup 1966]] for which he would have stood a chance of being selected.&lt;ref&gt;According to an interview with him from [https://archive.is/20081206183009/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/ThenAndNow_JohnnyHaynes.htm The FA]&lt;/ref&gt; The Stevenage Road Stand was renamed in his honour after his death in a car crash in 2005.

===1970–94: Mixed fortunes outside the top flight===
The aforementioned Third Division hiatus lasted only two seasons before the club was promoted back to the Second Division as runners-up in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]]. This spell also saw Fulham invited to the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]], which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972–73 season. This preceded a period of high-profile signings for the club under [[Alec Stock]] in the mid-1970s, including [[Alan Mullery]] and [[Bobby Moore]]. Fulham reached their only FA Cup final in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club then lost to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the final. This gained the club qualification to another European tournament, the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]], where they made the final, losing to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].

[[George Best]] played 47 times for the club in the [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77 season]]. [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play First Division football and play for England, rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.

The club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80 season]], which eventually resulted in [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]]'s sacking in October 1980, to be replaced by [[Malcolm Macdonald]]. With a strong squad during his 1980–1984 period in charge (with players such as [[Ray Houghton]], [[Tony Gale]], [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]], [[Gerry Peyton]] and [[Ray Lewington]]), they won promotion again in [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] back to the Second Division, although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender [[Dave Clement]] a few weeks before promotion was sealed.

In 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now [[London Broncos]] designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club, but which made financial losses every year while linked to Fulham F.C. Then called "Fulham Rugby League," they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.

In 1978, Fulham had signed Gordon "Ivor" Davies who, during two spells at Fulham, became the club's leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions; the record still stands. Fulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], losing 1–0 to Derby County away on the last day of the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83 season]] – although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a [[pitch invasion]] and inexplicably never replayed or finished. The side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an ill-advised merger attempt with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. It was only the intervention of ex-player [[Jimmy Hill]] that allowed the club to stay in business as a re-structured Fulham FC 1987 Ltd. In 1987, the club took part in what was then the longest penalty deciders ever recorded – it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] following a [[Football League Trophy|Freight Rover Trophy]] match.

In 1992, the foundation of the [[Premier League]], and the resignation of 22 clubs from The Football League, restored Fulham to that league's Second Division. However, the club were relegated to the new Third Division after a poor [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]], following which [[Ian Branfoot]] was appointed as team manager.

After an eighth-place finish in Branfoot's [[1994-95 in English football|first season]] in charge, the club hit its lowest-ever final league position in the [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] season, finishing 17th out of 24.&lt;ref name="Final 1994/1995 Football League Two Table"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; Branfoot was sacked as manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while. In February 1996, [[Micky Adams]] became [[player-manager]]. Adams oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of relegation danger. The next season, he engineered a second-place league finish, missing out on first place because several years previously the league had dropped the old "goal difference" system in favour of a "goals scored" tally, meaning Fulham finished behind [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. The club's chairman Jimmy Hill had argued that goals scored should decide places of teams tied on points, and the Football League clubs had voted the system in.

Egyptian businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] bought the club for £6.25&amp;nbsp;million in summer 1997.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 February 2003|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|title=Fulham pushed out Hill|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Mihir|last=Bose|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174720/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|archive-date=31 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"/&gt; Micky Adams was replaced by Al-Fayed in the aftermath of a mid-table start to the season. He installed a two-tier management "dream team" of [[Ray Wilkins]] as First Team Manager and [[Kevin Keegan]] as chief operating officer,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/Managers/KeeganAndWilkins.aspx 'Keegan &amp; Wilkins' page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501151428/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/Managers/KeeganAndWilkins.aspx |date=1 May 2012 }} the club's official website&lt;/ref&gt; pledging that the club would reach the Premier League within five years. After an argument over team selection, Wilkins left the club in May 1998 to hand over the full managerial duties to Keegan, who helped steer the club to promotion the next season, winning 101 points out of a possible 138, after spending £1.1&amp;nbsp;million to sign [[Paul Peschisolido]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], who was top scorer and captained by [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] – then the most expensive footballer outside the top two divisions of the English league.

In 1999, Keegan left Fulham to become manager of England, and [[Paul Bracewell]] was put in charge.
Bracewell was sacked in March 2000, as Fulham's promising early season form dwindled away to a mid-table finish. Frenchman [[Jean Tigana]] was put in charge and, having signed a number of young stars (including French striker [[Louis Saha]]), he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in the [[2000–01 in English football#Football League First Division|2000–01 season]], giving Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968. Fulham once again amassed 101 points out of a possible 138 in their scintillating title run, which was crowned with an open-top bus parade down [[Fulham Palace Road]]. They are the only team to have twice reached 100 points in a season. During the season, Chris Coleman was involved in a car crash that put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw a large turnover of players, with the only player to play for the club in all four leagues being [[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]].

Fulham returned to the top division of English football, and competed in the Premier League for the first time. The club finished the [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02 season]] in 13th place. Fulham were the only team to host top-flight football with some standing areas in the 21st century, but due to [[Taylor report|restrictions on standing]], this was not allowed to continue; clubs promoted from the second division had only three years to make their ground all-seater. Fulham were forced to [[groundshare]] with QPR at [[Loftus Road]] during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons while Craven Cottage was rebuilt as an all-seated stadium. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage, after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.&lt;ref name="future-hangs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham's future hangs in balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|author=BBC News|date=15 September 2003|access-date=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]], Fulham spent most of the season in the lower half of the table. Chairman Al-Fayed told manager Jean Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. However, with five games left to play and relegation still possible, Tigana was sacked, and Chris Coleman was temporarily put in charge. Fulham won 10 points from a possible 15 and managed to avoid relegation. Coleman was appointed manager on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003; despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation,&lt;ref&gt;Two of three writers of [[The Independent]] newspaper [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html predict] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html |date=* }} relegation for Fulham in the 2003–04 season.&lt;/ref&gt; he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish [[2003–04 FA Premier League|in his debut season]]. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], for whom they received a club record £13&amp;nbsp;million.

Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7&amp;nbsp;million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.&lt;ref name="fulham-lose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham lose Tigana court battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|author=BBC News|date=12 November 2004|access-date=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman notched up another satisfactory performance in the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05 season]] and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish. The following season Fulham improved by one place, finishing 12th – the high point of the season was a 1–0 win over local rivals and reigning champions Chelsea in the [[West London derby]] – Chelsea had only lost two games in two and a half years. The [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07 season]] proved to be Coleman's last, as on 10 April 2007, Fulham terminated his contract with immediate effect. His replacement was [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]]. Fulham only gained four points from five games with Sanchez as caretaker manager. They ensured top-flight survival that season by defeating a weakened [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] side 1–0 in the penultimate match of the season, and Sanchez was appointed manager.

===2008–10: Hodgson's transformation===
[[File:RoyHodgson.JPG|thumb|[[Roy Hodgson]] as manager at Fulham]]

Sanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer break, but, after just two league wins in the first five months of the season and with Fulham in the relegation zone, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007 after a defeat to Newcastle United.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Manager Sanchez sacked by Fulham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7155545.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |postscript= |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222060332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7155545.stm |archive-date=22 December 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Hodgson]] was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007 and took up his contractual duties on 30 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham appoint Hodgson as manager | date=28 December 2007 | accessdate=3 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231070143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | archive-date=31 December 2007 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; just two days before the January transfer window opened.

Hodgson's tenure did not start well and it took a month to secure his first win, against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], courtesy of a [[Jimmy Bullard]] free-kick. Fulham continued to struggle and a 3–1 home defeat in April at the hands of fellow strugglers [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/crying-shame-for-hodgson-as-fulham-look-doomed/792|title=Crying shame for Hodgson as Fulham look doomed|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|publisher=|access-date=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234314/http://www.sport.co.uk/football/crying-shame-for-hodgson-as-fulham-look-doomed/792|archive-date=2 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable. The turning point of the season came in the third-to-last match, against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Fulham trailed 2–0 at half-time and had the Premier League scores at that time become results, they would have been relegated. However, the introduction of [[Diomansy Kamara]] heralded the start of a fantastic comeback—Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered an amazing 3–2 victory. Fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at Craven Cottage, leaving survival in the club's own hands. Barring a goal-rush from fellow strugglers [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], a win against a [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] side looking ahead to their fourth FA Cup final would guarantee survival.

With 15 minutes to play at Portsmouth, Fulham were drawing, and with Birmingham City and Reading leading comfortably against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and Derby County respectively, they looked likely to be relegated. However, Fulham earned a free-kick with 76 minutes played; Jimmy Bullard's delivery found [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore. Fulham narrowly missed out on a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] place via [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fairplay]] by a dubious 0.8 of a point behind Manchester City, who lost 8–1 at Middlesbrough.

In the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]], Fulham finished seventh, their highest-ever league placing, earning qualification for the inaugural [[UEFA Europa League]], the second time that the club had entered a UEFA competition.

[[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]] was arguably the most successful season in the club's history. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the quarter-finals for the second year running, and finished 12th in the Premier League, despite fielding weakened teams in the last few matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8665276.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arsenal 4–0 Fulham | date=9 May 2010 | access-date=9 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222622/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8665276.stm | archive-date=12 January 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the inaugural [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League season]], however, Fulham reached the final, meeting Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]], who had dropped down from the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], at the [[Volksparkstadion]] in [[Hamburg]]. In their first European cup final, the Cottagers were beaten 2–1 after extra time, having drawn 1–1 after full-time. The achievement of taking Fulham so unexpectedly far, beating famous teams like [[Hamburger SV]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], holders [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[FC Basel|Basel]] in the competition, led to Roy Hodgson being voted the [[LMA Manager of the Year]] by the widest margin in the history of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739 |title=Fulham's Roy Hodgson voted Manager of the Year by fellow bosses – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231143218/http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739 |archive-date=31 December 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The home match in the round of 16 was arguably Fulham's greatest result in the history of the club. Despite losing 3–1 in the first leg at Italian giants Juventus and falling behind minutes into the second leg at Craven Cottage, Fulham scored four goals with no reply from Juventus.

At the end of the season, Hodgson left Fulham to manage Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8721942.stm|title = Roy Hodgson leaves Fulham to become Liverpool manager|publisher = BBC Sport|accessdate = 1 July 2010|date = 1 July 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112211336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8721942.stm|archive-date = 12 January 2016|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–13: Established in the Premier League===
On 29 July 2010, [[Mark Hughes]] was named the successor to Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. Hughes had previously managed Manchester City, the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national team]] and Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/8866133.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hughes confirmed as Fulham boss | date=29 July 2010 | access-date=29 July 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112211338/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/8866133.stm | archive-date=12 January 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' first match in charge was against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]]. The highlight of the season was a 4–0 win in the FA Cup over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, all goals coming in the first half. Hughes resigned as manager of Fulham on 2 June 2011, having spent fewer than 11 months at the club. The Whites had an encouraging finish in eighth position and qualified for the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] via Fairplay.

On 7 June 2011, [[Martin Jol]] signed a two-year contract with Fulham, becoming successor to Hughes.

However, the Cottagers were knocked out with the last seconds of the group stage matches, [[Odense BK]] equalising to make a draw, leaving Fulham in third place, with Polish side [[Wisła Kraków]] instead progressing to the next round.

Fulham's Premier League form in the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]] was mixed, with the continuing away-record hangover of previous seasons dragging on. In October 2011, Fulham had an emphatic 6–0 home win over neighbours QPR, with [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] scoring a hat-trick for Fulham in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15051267 |title=Fulham 6 QPR 0 |work=BBC Sport |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017175912/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15051267 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The January 2012 transfer window saw [[Bobby Zamora]] move over the Hammersmith flyover to Loftus Road, with Russian striker [[Pavel Pogrebnyak]] coming in place from [[VfB Stuttgart]].

However, they failed to achieve this after losing their last game away at Tottenham.

Fulham secured a 6th place finish after an impressive finish to the season, which saw Fulham collect 37 points out of their last 17 games, and entered the [[2017 English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], where they were undone by a controversial [[Yann Kermorgant]] penalty, which saw Reading triumph 2-1 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39853033|title=Reading 1-0 Fulham (agg: 2-1)|accessdate=30 May 2018|work=BBC Sport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512045809/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39853033|archive-date=12 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor first half of the 2017/18 season, which included a 1-0 loss away to bottom placed Sunderland on 16 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42289904|title=Sunderland 1-0 Fulham|date=16 December 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=29 May 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618204355/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42289904|archive-date=18 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Fulham struggled to break the top half of the table.

Fulham Football Club is owned by [[Shahid Khan]]. Khan completed his purchase of the club from [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] on 12 July 2013 for a reported £150–200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23297785|title=Fulham: Mohamed Al Fayed sells club to Shahid Khan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=12 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713204346/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23297785|archive-date=13 July 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ownership of Fulham, Al-Fayed had provided Fulham F.C. with £187 million in interest-free loans.&lt;ref name="record-losses"&gt;{{Cite news |date=19 May 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole |title=Record income but record losses for Premier League |work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=David |last=Conn |access-date=11 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201173253/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole |archive-date=1 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 Fulham posted annual losses of £16.9 million, with Al-Fayed stating that he would "continue to make funds available to achieve our goals both on and off the pitch" and that "the continued success of Fulham and its eventual financial self-sustainability is my priority."&lt;ref name="losses-despite"&gt;{{Cite news|date=15 March 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12746757|title=Fulham football club losses up despite on-field success|publisher=BBC News|access-date=20 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222626/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12746757|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013 Fulham were effectively debt-free as Al-Fayed converted the loans into equity in the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/29/fulham-debt-free-al-fayed|title=Fulham effectively debt-free as Fayed converts loans into equity|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113022615/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/29/fulham-debt-free-al-fayed|archive-date=13 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors==

==Fulham in Europe==
{{Main|Fulham F.C. in European football}}

Fulham are a member of the [[European Club Association]], having qualified three times for European Competition, qualifying for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] after their inaugural season in the Premier League, and the [[UEFA Europa League]] twice, they played in the inaugural edition of the competition after their club-best seventh-place finish in the [[2008–09 Premier League]] season, and qualified again for the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|2011–12 Europa League]] via England's Fair Play berth. Fulham are unbeaten at home in European competition, in 23 games, with a record of 17 wins and six draws.

On 18 February 2010, Fulham's home unbeaten run in European competition stretched to 13 games when they beat UEFA Cup holders Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine 2–1 at Craven Cottage in the Europa League Round of 32 first leg, with goals from [[Zoltán Gera]] and [[Bobby Zamora]]. In Fulham's 46 games in all European competitions, (excluding the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final]] lost in extra-time) they have only lost seven of them (all away): 2–1 to [[Hertha BSC]], 1–0 to [[FC Amkar Perm|Amkar Perm]], 2–1 to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], 3–1 to Juventus, 1–0 to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, 1–0 to [[FC Twente|Twente]] and 1–0 to [[Wisła Kraków]].

After defeating Juventus on 18 March, Fulham advanced to the quarter-finals against reigning German champions [[VfL Wolfsburg]]. On 1 April, Fulham defeated the Germans 2–1 in the first leg of the two-legged home-and-away series. Bobby Zamora and [[Damien Duff]] scored within five minutes of each other in the second half, while Wolfsburg defender [[Alexander Madlung]] scored two minutes from time to cut the deficit in half. One week later at Wolfsburg, Zamora struck again, this time in the first minute to give Fulham an overall 3–1 lead in the series. Wolfsburg were unable to overturn the two goal deficit, and Fulham advanced to the semi-finals of the competition. On 22 April, following a long coach trip due to flights being grounded because of the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|Icelandic volcano]], Fulham played out a 0–0 draw against [[Hamburger SV]] in the first leg of their semi-final in Hamburg. On 29 April, they then beat Hamburg 2–1 at Craven Cottage to secure a place in [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]].

On 12 May, Fulham lost 2–1 after extra time to [[Atlético Madrid]] in the final. Fulham went 1–0 down, though it ended 1–1 after 90 minutes thanks to a Davies equaliser to force extra time. [[Diego Forlán]], however, scored the winner on the 116th minute to clinch the game for the Spanish team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|title=Fulham 2 – 1 Hamburg (agg 2 – 1)|date=28 April 2010|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2010|first=Phil|last=McNulty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501140012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|archive-date=1 May 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulham qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League by virtue of the Fair Play league. They started their campaign in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League#First qualifying round|first qualifying round]], beating [[NSÍ Runavík]], followed by a win over [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|Second qualifying round]]. A 3–1 aggregate win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk saw them into the group stages, where they were drawn against Twente, [[Odense BK|Odense]] and Wisła Kraków in group K. They were knocked out of the tournament when Odense equalised for a 2–2 draw in the very last second of the final group game, leaving Fulham stranded in third, with Kraków going through along with Twente in first.

==Managers==
Fulham have had 37 managers in 114 years. Prior to the appointment of the first manager at the club (Bradshaw in 1904), the duties normally assigned to a modern-day manager would have been shared between club secretary, captain, and other officials.

&lt;!-- Do NOT add Scott Parker to this table, this table does not include caretakers. --&gt;

* * [[Frank Osborne (footballer)|Frank Osborne]] was employed continuously by the club from 1948 to 1963, but only spent the above periods as designated manager.
* ** Ian Branfoot continued to be employed by the club after his dismissal as manager.
* &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Kevin Keegan was employed by the club as chief operating officer (during which time he essentially acted as an [[Assistant coach|assistant manager]]) during the time of his predecessor (Ray Wilkins) being the actual manager.
* &lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; René Meulensteen was appointed as Head Coach under previous manager [[Martin Jol]] (during which time he essentially acted as an assistant manager), but never took on the title of "manager" after Jol's departure, despite assuming the duties usually assigned to one. He remained as Head Coach for four days after Magath's appointment before being released.
* &lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; Some managers have only had the official description of "Head Coach" rather than "Manager": René Meulensteen and Slaviša Jokanović, as well as interim head coach Peter Grant.

'''Managerial records:'''
*Only one man has managed the club through two different spells, Frank Osborne, in 1948–49 and then 1953–56.
*The longest spell as Fulham manager was by Phil Kelso, 15 years (1909–1924)
*Several managers have failed to last more than a year at the club: Bobby Robson, Alan Dicks, Ray Wilkins, Paul Bracewell, Lawrie Sanchez, Mark Hughes, Rene Meulensteen and Felix Magath. Further to this, Frank Osborne only had a year after his initial arrival at the club during which he was principally in charge of the team (before Dodgin, senior) arrived, although he later took sole charge of the club for an extended period.

'''Temporary managers''' at the club have included:
*[[Johnny Haynes]]: Took over after [[Bobby Robson|Sir Bobby Robson]] was fired in 1968 for only a handful of matches. ''The Maestro'' was offered the role permanently but had no inclination to become a manager.
*[[Karl-Heinz Riedle]]: when Paul Bracewell was fired halfway through the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999–2000]] season, there was a temporary period of Fulham being managed by their [[striker (football)|striker]] Karl-Heinz Riedle, assisted his old boss at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Roy Evans]]. Riedle injured a lung in the season's penultimate game.
*[[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]]: after Tigana resigned four months before planned in 2003, Chris Coleman was appointed as caretaker manager, much to the delight of the fans. Having initially denied he wanted the post, Coleman accepted the role of full-time manager that summer.
*[[Lawrie Sanchez]]: when Coleman was sacked, Sanchez came in to take control of the club for the remaining five games of the season. (See above)&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6543541.stm 'Coleman out as Sanchez takes over'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423131733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6543541.stm |date=23 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ray Lewington]]: took temporary charge of Fulham for three games following Lawrie Sanchez's dismissal in December 2007.  Lewington also took temporary charge of the club in July 2010 after Roy Hodgson had left the club until the appointment of Mark Hughes.
*[[Kit Symons]]: temporarily took charge of Fulham after Felix Magath's dismissal in September 2014 before being appointed on 29 October.
*[[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]]: took charge of Fulham for three games after [[Kit Symons]]' dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FulhamFC/status/667721213490368513|title=Fulham Football Club on Twitter: "Peter Grant, who will be taking the First Team for the MK Dons game, discusses training &amp; looks ahead to the match"|work=Twitter|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Stuart Gray (footballer, born 1960)|Stuart Gray]]: succeeded Grant as temporary manager (holding down the job title of "senior coach") after poor results in Grant's three games in charge whilst the board looked for a permanent successor to Kit Symons.
*[[Scott Parker]]: took over as caretaker after [[Claudio Ranieri]] left the club on 28 February 2019 after winning just 3 of his 17 league games in charge.

==Grounds==
Between the years 1879 and when Fulham had a ground to call their own in 1896, they played at a number of stadiums, only some of which were recorded and this should not be regarded as a full or complete list. Only rivals and former landlords Queens Park Rangers have played at more home stadiums. Some of the early grounds listed below are likely to have been parks and parkland, which have now been developed. Even when the club purchased Craven Cottage and the surrounding land in 1894, they had to wait two years before they could play a game there.
* 1879: (possible first ground though records are inaccurate) – [[Hurlingham Park]], [[Fulham]]
* 1879–83: [[Star Road]], [[Hammersmith]]
* 1883–84: [[Eel Brook Common]], Fulham
* 1884–85: [[Lillie Rec]], Fulham
* 1885–86: [[Putney Lower Common]], [[Putney]]
* 1886–88: [[Ranelagh House]], Fulham
* 1888–89: [[Barn Elms|Barn Elms Playing Fields]], [[Barnes (London suburb)|Barnes]] (the rugby fields are located across the Thames from Craven Cottage today)
* 1889–91: [[Parsons Green (Park)|Parsons Green]], Fulham and Roskell's Fields (next to [[Parsons Green tube station|Parsons Green Underground station]])
* 1891–95: [[The Half Moon (music venue)|Half Moon]], [[Putney]]
* 1895–96: [[Brompton, Kensington|West Brompton]]
* 1896–2002: [[Craven Cottage]], Fulham
* 2002–04: [[Loftus Road]], [[Shepherd's Bush]] (groundshare with Queens Park Rangers during Craven Cottage's renovation)
* 2004–: [[Craven Cottage]], Fulham (read the Craven Cottage article for future prospects of the ground.)

Billy the Badger wears the number 79 Fulham shirt, in reference to the club's year of founding, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Match of the Day, Sunday 3 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy first surrounded Billy when he tried to cheer up Chelsea manager [[Avram Grant]] during a home match in front of the television cameras. Secondly, Billy was seen on television being sent off during the home game against Aston Villa on 3 February 2008 for break-dancing in the corner of the pitch after the referee had commenced the game. Billy blamed his badger hearing and eyesight for the incident, and apologised to referee [[Chris Foy (referee)|Chris Foy]].{{cn|date=January 2019}} On 11 March 2009, Billy walked across the goal during a match although it was not spotted by the referee.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The former mascot for Fulham was Sir Craven of Cottage, the Knight. The cheerleaders were known as the Cravenettes.
