'''Liverpool Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club in [[Liverpool]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club [[List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won|has won]] 5 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|more]] than any other English club, 3 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups]], 3 [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, 18 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], 7 [[FA Cup]]s, a record 8 [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], and 15 [[FA Community Shield]]s.

Founded in 1892, the club joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] the following year and has played at [[Anfield]] since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when [[Bill Shankly]] and [[Bob Paisley]] led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of [[Rafael Benítez]] and captained by [[Steven Gerrard]], Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]].

Liverpool was the [[Deloitte Football Money League|ninth highest-earning]] football club in the world in 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €424.2&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html|title=Deloitte Football Money League 2018|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|eighth most valuable]] football club in 2018, valued at $1.944&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/06/12/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2018/#3dddb7c845c8|title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2018|last=Ozanian|first=Mike|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is one of the best supported teams in the world.&lt;ref name=“global”&gt;{{cite news |title=How Liverpool's worldwide fanbase will be tuning into events at Manchester United |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/how-liverpools-worldwide-fanbase-tuning-14387039 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. 

The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the [[1985 European Cup Final]] in Brussels, with 39 people – mostly Italians and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition, and the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a [[Human stampede|crush]] against perimeter fencing.

The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]".

[[File:John Houlding.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Houlding]], the founder of Liverpool F.C.|alt=Black and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.]]

Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] committee and [[John Houlding]], club president and owner of the land at [[Anfield]]. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to [[Goodison Park]] in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.&lt;ref name="formed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=11 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712112221/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |archivedate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after [[The Football Association]] refused to recognise the club as Everton.{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=14}} The team won the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in its début season, and joined the [[Football League Second Division]] at the start of the 1893–94 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], which it won in 1901 and again in 1906.{{sfn|Graham|1985|pp=16–18}}

Liverpool reached its first [[FA Cup Final]] in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], losing 1–0 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-[[West Ham Utd]] centre half [[George Kay]].{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=20}} Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=14}} The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|pp=50–51}} Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] in the 1958–59 FA Cup, [[Bill Shankly]] was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24&amp;nbsp;players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other "[[The Boot Room|Boot Room]]" members [[Joe Fagan]], [[Reuben Bennett]], and [[Bob Paisley]] began reshaping the team.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=57}}

[[File:Shankly statue out front.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Statue of a man with his arms held aloft|Statue of [[Bill Shankly]] outside [[Anfield]]. Shankly won promotion to the First Division and the club's first league title since 1947.]]

The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1965/intro.html |title=1965/66: Stan the man for Dortmund |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510160346/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season%3D1965/intro.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool won both the League and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.{{sfn|Kelly|1999|p=86}} In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.{{sfn|Pead|1986|p=414}} During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive [[Football League Cup|League Cups]]; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=157}}

Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=158}} Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.{{sfn|Cox|Russell|Vamplew|2002|p=90}} Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] at the [[King Baudouin Stadium|Heysel Stadium]]. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_2733000/2733979.stm |title=On This Day&amp;nbsp;– 29 May 1985: Fans die in Heysel rioting |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=29 May 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hillsborough Memorial, Anfield.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=3 burgundy tablets with gold engraved writing. Below the tablets are flowers.|The Hillsborough memorial, which is engraved with the names of the 96 people who died in the [[Hillsborough disaster]].]]

Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and [[Kenny Dalglish]] was appointed as [[player-manager]].{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=172}} During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup "[[Double (association football)|Double]]" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the [[Hillsborough disaster]]: in an FA Cup semi-final against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm |title=On This Day&amp;nbsp;– 15 April 1989: Soccer fans crushed at Hillsborough |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=15 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hillsborough-victim-died-accidentally-coroner-says-withdrawal-of-treatment-not-to-blame-1469037.html |title=Hillsborough victim died 'accidentally': Coroner says withdrawal of treatment not to blame |work=The Independent |date=22 December 1993 |accessdate=28 August 2010 |first=Malcolm |last=Pithers}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting [[Taylor Report]] paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/318497.stm |title=A hard lesson to learn |publisher=BBC |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last minute of the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/29/arsenal-liverpool-1989-football |title=The night Football was reborn |work=The Observer |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |first=Jason |last=Cowley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player [[Graeme Souness]].{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|pp=104–105}} Under his leadership Liverpool won the [[1992 FA Cup Final]], but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by [[Roy Evans]], and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so [[Gérard Houllier]] was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |title=The Boot Room Boys: Inside the Anfield Boot Room |page=227 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a "[[Treble (association football)|Treble]]": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335026.stm |title=Houllier acclaims Euro triumph |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1600193.stm |title=Houllier 'satisfactory' after surgery |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 October 2001 |accessdate=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.

Houllier was replaced by [[Rafael Benítez]] at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]], beating [[A.C. Milan]] 3–2 in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] after the match ended with a score of 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AC Milan 3–3 Liverpool (aet)|publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4573159.stm|accessdate=15 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4756045.stm |title=Liverpool 3–3 West Ham (aet) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2006 |accessdate=26 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American businessmen [[George N.

In the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League.

==Colours and badge==
[[File:Liverpool FC 1892-1896 kit.jpg|thumb|upright|Liverpool's home colours worn from 1892 to 1896&lt;ref name="colours"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/historical-lfc-kits |title=Historical LFC Kits |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=12 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724034342/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/historical-lfc-kits |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A blue and white shirt and white shorts]]

For much of Liverpool's history its home colours have been all red, but when the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894, when the club adopted the city's colour of red.&lt;ref name="formed" /&gt; The city's symbol of the [[liver bird]] was adopted as the club's badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964, when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip.&lt;ref name=colours /&gt; Liverpool played in all red for the first time against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], as [[Ian St. John]] recalled in his autobiography:

:{{quote|He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. "Get into those shorts and let's see how you look", he said. "Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall." "Why not go the whole hog, boss?" I suggested. "Why not wear red socks? Let's go out all in red." Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-1817155,00.html |title=Shankly: the hero who let me down|work=The Times|accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=9 October 2005 |first=Ian |last=St. John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season, when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and [[ecru]], the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012–15, the kits were designed by [[Warrior Sports]], who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lfc-and-warrior-announcement |title=LFC and Warrior announcement |accessdate=18 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120015751/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lfc-and-warrior-announcement |archivedate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Warrior's parent company [[New Balance]] announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Balance Challenges Nike And Adidas With Entry into Global Soccer Market |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/02/04/new-balance-enters-global-soccer-market/ |first=Kurt |last=Badenhausen |work=Forbes |date=4 February 2015|accessdate=4 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by [[Umbro]] until 1985, when they were replaced by [[Adidas]], who produced the kits until 1996 when [[Reebok]] took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.{{sfn|Crilly|2007|p=28}}

Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jul/06/theknowledge.sport |first1=James |last1=Dart |first2=Mark |last2=Tinklin |title=Has a streaker ever scored? |work=The Guardian |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the club has been sponsored by [[Crown Paints]], [[Candy (company)|Candy]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Standard Chartered]]. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/05/carlsberg-liverpool-sponsorship-markets-equities-beer.html |title=Carlsberg and Liverpool might part ways |work=Forbes |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |first=Javier |last=Espinoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool and Standard Chartered announce sponsorship deal |url=http://www.standardchartered.com/media-centre/press-releases/2009/documents/20090914/index.html |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=Standard Chartered Bank |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the [[Shankly Gates]]. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an [[eternal flame]] burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/hillsborough |title=Hillsborough |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool kit launch sparks anger among Hillsborough families|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18033752|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|information on Liverpool's abandoned proposed new stadium|Stanley Park Stadium}}
[[File:Panorama of Anfield with new main stand (29676137824).jpg|thumb|alt=The interior of a stadium.|[[Anfield]], home of Liverpool F.C.]]

Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=112}} Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=187}}

The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.&lt;ref name="Pocket"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The pocket book of Liverpool|last=Moynihan|first=Leo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]] after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=113}} The hill was the site of the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in the [[Second Boer War]], where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=188}} At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0100news/tm_objectid=17610578&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061&amp;headline=how-kop-tuned-in-to-glory-days-name_page.html#story_continue |first=James |last=Pearce |title=How Kop tuned into glory days |work=Liverpool Echo |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210193006/http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0100news/tm_objectid%3D17610578%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50061%26headline%3Dhow-kop-tuned-in-to-glory-days-name_page.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak, and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276.&lt;ref name="prem"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4f/53/0,,12306~152399,00.pdf |title=Premier League Handbook Season 2010/11 |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=Premier League |page=35 |chapter=Club Directory |accessdate=17 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214090029/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4f/53/0%2C%2C12306~152399%2C00.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the ''Taylor Report'' precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/stadium/anfield |title=Anfield |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed [[Stanley Park Stadium]] in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1992484.stm |title=Liverpool unveil new stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2002 |accessdate=17 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/gronudmove/tm_objectid=14487239%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=reds%2dstadium%2dgets%2dgo%2dahead-name_page.html |first=Mike |last=Hornby |title=Reds stadium gets go-ahead |work=Liverpool Echo |date=31 July 2004 |accessdate=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a [[999-year lease]] on the proposed site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/5327426.stm |title=Liverpool get go-ahead on stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with [[HKS, Inc.]] contracted to build the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7081610.stm|title=Liverpool's stadium move granted |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300&amp;nbsp;million needed for the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8261975.stm |title=Liverpool stadium 'will be built' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ben|title=Liverpool to redevelop Anfield instead of building on Stanley Park|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19935925|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100&amp;nbsp;million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260&amp;nbsp;million project to improve the Anfield area. Jurgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as "impressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-37319956|title=Liverpool's new Main Stand boosts Anfield capacity to 54,000|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. [[UEFA]] laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1496054,00.html |first=David |last=McKie |title=Thatcher set to demand FA ban on games in Europe |work=The Guardian |date=31 May 1985 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years.

The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper published an article entitled "The Truth", in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/11/pressandpublishing.football |first=David |last=Smith |title=The city that eclipsed the Sun |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' more than 20&amp;nbsp;years later.&lt;ref name="boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/an-own-goal-rooney-caught-in-crossfire-between-the-sun-and-an-unforgiving-city-552460.html|title=An own goal?

Liverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the [[Merseyside derby]].

==Ownership and finances==
[[File:John W Henry-Fenway (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photograph|[[John W. Henry]] of [[Fenway Sports Group]], the parent company of Liverpool]]

As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. [[John McKenna]] took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=108}} McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=109}} The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=110}} His successor was [[Noel White]] who became chairman in 1990.{{sfn|Reade|2009|p=206}} In August 1991 [[David Moores]], whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became chairman. His uncle [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51&amp;nbsp;percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/03/05/dubai-liverpool-bids-idUKB81717020080305 |title=Factbox Soccer who owns Liverpool Football Club |agency=Reuters |date=5 March 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |first=Nagesh |last=Narayana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9&amp;nbsp;million. The pair paid £5,000&amp;nbsp;per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6244441.stm |first=Bill |last=Wilson |title=US business duo at Liverpool helm |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7197675.stm |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Liverpool braced for takeover bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Broughton]] was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.&lt;ref name="broughtonchair"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/16/martin-broughton-liverpool-chairman-sale|title=Liverpool appoint Martin Broughton as chairman to oversee sale of club|last=Bandini|first=Paolo|date=16 April 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor [[KPMG]] to qualify its audit opinion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/07/liverpool-record-losses|title=Auditors cast doubt on future of Liverpool after losses|date=7 May 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2010 |first=David |last=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's creditors, including the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company.

==Liverpool in popular culture==
Because of its successful history, Liverpool is often featured when football is depicted in British culture and has appeared in a number of media firsts. The club appeared in the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]'', which screened highlights of its match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=192}} Liverpool fans featured in the [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Fearless (Pink Floyd song)|Fearless]]", in which they sang excerpts from "You'll Never Walk Alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A330652 |title=The Hillsborough Tragedy |publisher=BBC |date=16 June 2000 |accessdate=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released a song known as the "[[Anfield Rap]]", featuring [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] and other members of the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4770012.stm |title=Footballer Barnes for rap return |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary drama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by [[Jimmy McGovern]], was screened in 1996. It featured [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Trevor Hicks, whose story is the focus of the script. Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/04/99/hillsborough/313635.stm |title=Hillsborough's Sad Legacy |publisher=BBC |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool featured in the film ''[[The 51st State]]'' (also known as ''Formula 51''), in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza ([[Robert Carlyle]]) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180304 |title=Formula 51 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=18 October 2002 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |first=Roger |last=Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was featured in a children's television show called ''[[Scully (TV series)|Scully]]''; the plot revolved around a young boy, Francis Scully, who tried to gain a trial match with Liverpool.
