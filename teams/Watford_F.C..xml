'''Watford Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], England, that plays in the [[Premier League]], the highest level in the English football league system.  Founded in 1898 by the amalgamation of West Herts and Watford St. Mary's. After finishing the [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15 season]] as Southern League champions under the management of [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]], Watford joined [[the Football League]] in 1920.

==History==

===Early years===
Watford Football Club was formed on the 15th April 1898 by the amalgamation of two strong local clubs, West Herts and Watford St Mary's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/rivalry-the/ |title=The Rivalry |work=The Straw Plaiters |accessdate=22 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Watford Observer of the 7th May 1898 reported -
"When three-parts of the season was gone, there were whispers of the advantages of amalgamation of the two clubs. That the principle was right few disputed, and the question narrowed itself down to a few minor difficulties. It was ascertained that the executive on both sides regarded the suggestion favourably, and joint meetings of the officials were arranged. The proposals took a definite shape, and very soon amalgamation was a thing accomplished. It was decided, however, that each club should finish off its fixtures. Next season the Watford club will play on the Cassio-Road ground, and one of the chief ideas of the amalgamation is to have a second team of sufficient strength to be an attraction while the first string is engaged elsewhere. The details of the amalgamation scheme we have already given in these columns. 
Generally speaking, then, the local football season which has just closed has been a most important one. It has witnessed two steps which have marked fresh epochs - the adoption of professionalism and the amalgamation of West Herts and Watford St. Mary's." 
The amalgamation was approved by the full F.A. committee on the 27th May 1898 as reported by the Lichfield Mercury of the 28th May 1898 "permission was given to Watford St. Mary's and West Herts to take the name of Watford Football Club, the two clubs having amalgamated."

West Herts were previously known as Watford Rovers who were formed in 1881 by Henry Grover, who went on to play for the club as a [[full-back (football)|full back]].&lt;ref name="wfcnotablepeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10400~65917,00.html |title=They shaped the club |accessdate=27 October 2009 |publisher=Watford Football Club |date=29 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170637/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/History/0%2C%2C10400~65917%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j15/&gt; Rovers, originally composed entirely of [[amateur football|amateur players]], held home games at several locations in the [[Watford|town of Watford]].&lt;ref name=j15&gt;Jones 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronology/&gt; The team first competed in the [[FA Cup]] in the [[FA Cup 1886–87|1886–87 season]], and in 1889 Watford won the [[Herts Senior Cup|County Cup]] for the first time. The team became the football section of "West Hertfordshire Club and Ground" in 1891, and consequently moved to a ground on [[Cassio Road]]. As "West Herts" they joined the [[Southern Football League]] in 1896.  West Herts fortunes slumped at the start of the 1897/98 season and attendances were less than 200.  They took the bold step of turning professional and their fortunes revived. Watford St. Mary's were runners up in the Hertfordshire Senior Cup of 1894/95 and attracted crowds of 400 to 500 even when West Herts were at home. The two clubs talked of an amalgamation, which ultimately occurred on 15 April 1898. This was reported by the Watford Observer of the 7th May 1898.  It was agreed that the two clubs should complete their remaining fixtures for the season.  The new club was named Watford Football Club.&lt;ref name=chronology&gt;Jones 1996, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SkillyWilliams.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=The head and shoulders of a man, wearing a hat and coat.|Long-serving [[Skilly Williams]] was Watford's first choice goalkeeper between 1914 and 1926.]]Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager – former England international and First Division top scorer [[John Goodall]]. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910.&lt;ref name=managers/&gt; Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15 season]] under his successor, [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]]. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War – after finishing the [[1919–20 Watford F.C. season|1919–20 season]] runners-up on [[goal average]], the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new [[Football League Third Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1996, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[1921–22 in English football|1921–22]], the third tier of [[The Football League]] consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and also battling to hold on to their league status.&lt;ref name=arsenal&gt;Hodgson, Guy (17 December 1999).

===Post-war era===
[[File:Watford FC League Performance.svg|thumb|250px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Watford in the English football league.]]Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in [[1950–51 in English football|1950–51]] meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denied F.C.: The Football League Election Struggles|first=Dave|last=Twdell|publisher=Yore Publications|year=2001|isbn=978-1-874427-98-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBain returned in 1956,&lt;ref name=managers/&gt; and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the [[1958–59 in English football|1958–59]] season, and Watford were placed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]].

McGarry joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] in 1964, and was replaced by player-manager [[Ken Furphy]], from [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]]&lt;ref name=mcgarry/&gt; Furphy rebuilt the team around players such as [[Keith Eddy]] and [[Dennis Bond (footballer)|Dennis Bond]], but after holding Liverpool to a draw in the FA Cup and narrowly failing to win promotion in [[1966–67 in English football|1966–67]], Bond was sold to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]30,000, Watford's record transfer receipt at the time.&lt;ref name="Jones 1996, p. 43"&gt;Jones 1996, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Furphy's rebuilding came to fruition in 1969 with the signing of [[Barry Endean]], whose arrival marked the start of an unbeaten run after Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1996, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Watford secured the Third Division title in April, at home to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].

Watford's kit has changed considerably over the course of the club's history. The club's kit featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of black and white was adopted for the 1909–10 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black shorts for 1959–60, the team's nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watford's kits started featuring red, and the gold was changed to yellow.

When Watford changed kit colours in 1959, supporters chose ''The Hornets'' as the team's new nickname, and the club later introduced a crest depicting a hornet.&lt;ref name=historicalkits/&gt; In 1974 the design was changed to depict Harry the Hornet, the club's mascot.&lt;ref name=historicalkits/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Glenn (19 April 2008).

Watford Rovers played at several grounds in the late 19th century, including [[Cassiobury Park]], Vicarage Meadow and Market Street, [[Watford]]. In 1890, the team moved to a site on Cassio Road, and remained there for 32 years, before moving to Watford's current stadium at nearby [[Vicarage Road]].&lt;ref name=chronology/&gt; The new stadium was initially owned by [[Benskins Brewery]]; the club rented the ground until 2001, when it purchased the freehold outright. However, the club's financial situation worsened following the purchase, and in 2002 Watford sold the ground for £6&amp;nbsp;million in a deal which entitled Watford to buy the stadium back for £7&amp;nbsp;million in future. Watford took up this option in 2004 using a campaign backed and funded by the fans called "Lets buy back the Vic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/516393.Watford_seal_Vicarage_Road_deal/|title=Watford seal Vicarage Road Deal|work=Watford Observer|author=Phillips, Oli|date=6 August 2004|accessdate=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822082325/http://mobile.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/516393.Watford_seal_Vicarage_Road_deal/|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was replaced by his former captain, [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]], who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1991, pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Kent led the club to the Southern League title in [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15]], and missed out on a second title in [[1919–20 Watford F.C. season|1919–20]] on [[goal average]], before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors – [[Fred Pagnam]], [[Neil McBain]] and [[Bill Findlay (footballer)|Bill Findlay]] – all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]], although Findlay did lead Watford to a [[Football League Third Division South Cup|Third Division South Cup]] win in 1937.

Up until Findlay's departure in 1947, Watford had been managed by five managers in 44 years, all of whom played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players.&lt;ref name="managers"&gt;Jones 1996, pp. 267–274.&lt;/ref&gt; After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. [[Ron Burgess (footballer)|Ron Burgess]] led Watford to promotion from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1959–60. [[Bill McGarry]] was only in charge for one full season (1963–64), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor [[Ken Furphy]] matched that achievement in 1966–67, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first [[FA Cup]] semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy's departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers [[George Kirby (footballer)|George Kirby]] and [[Mike Keen]].&lt;ref name="managers" /&gt;

Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the first time in Watford's history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 1983–84, as well as reaching the [[1984 FA Cup final]]. Taylor left the club at the end of 1986–87. Under the six subsequent permanent managers ([[Dave Bassett]], [[Steve Harrison (footballer)|Steve Harrison]], [[Colin Lee]], [[Steve Perryman]], [[Glenn Roeder]] and [[Kenny Jackett]]), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 1997–98 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the [[Premier League]] in [[1999–2000 Watford F.C. season|1999–2000]]. Since Taylor's retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, [[Aidy Boothroyd]] took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/7707054.stm "Boothroyd &amp; Watford part company"]. BBC Sport. 3 November 2008. Retrieved 14 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Watford's takeover by the Pozzo family, [[Gianfranco Zola]] was appointed head coach, replacing former centre back [[Sean Dyche]] in July 2012,.&lt;ref name="managers2" /&gt; Zola took Watford to third position in the Championship in 2012–13 but resigned on 16 December 2013. He was replaced by fellow Italian [[Giuseppe Sannino|Beppe Sannino]] in December 2013. Sannino guided the team to a final league position of 13th.

Despite winning four of the first five league matches of the 2014/15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino's position had become the subject of much speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] the day before.

Sannino's departure initiated a bizarre sequence of events which led to Watford having three further head coaches in little more than a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] head coach [[Óscar García Junyent|Óscar García]] as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Leeds United F.C|Leeds United]] for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. [[Billy McKinlay]], who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11686/9549731/billy-mckinlay-is-still-bemused-after-a-short-spell-at-watford/|title=Bill McKinlay left bemused following his spell at Watford|work=Sky Sports|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] coach [[Slaviša Jokanović]] appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/11522881.COMMENT__Must_be_more_to_Watford_s_disgraceful_treatment_of_McKinlay/?ref=mrs]. Watford Observer, 8 October 2014. Retrieved 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 2015, [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] was announced as the new head coach as the replacement to Jokanović,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/13315768.Flores_is_Hornets__new_boss/]. Watford Observer, 4 June 2015. Retrieved 4 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; who had failed to agree contract terms. Despite going on to lead the newly promoted Watford to a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it was announced on 13 May 2016 that Sánchez Flores would be leaving the club at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnton|first1=Simon|title=Quique Sánchez Flores was no longer the answer to Watford's question|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/quique-sanchez-flores-watford-departure-explained|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sanchez Flores's departure, Walter Mazzarri was announced as Watford's head coach starting on 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/walter-mazzarri-watford-fc-head-coach-premier-league-3121237.aspx "OFFICIAL: Walter Mazzarri Appointed Head Coach At Watford"].

Mazzari's tenure as manager was terminated at the end of the season.
On 27 May 2017 Marco Silva was appointed Head Coach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.watfordfc.com/club/silva-named-hornets-head-coach]&lt;/ref&gt;

Striker [[Luther Blissett]] holds the record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all competitions between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in [[The Football League]] during the same period is also a club record. Blissett holds the corresponding goalscoring records, with 186 career Watford goals, 148 of which were in the league. The records for the most league goals in a season is held by [[Cliff Holton]], having scored 42 goals in the 1959–60 season. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in September 1903.&lt;ref name="wfcrecords"&gt;[https://archive.today/20110718004727/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/History/0,,10400~65910,00.html "Watford FC club records"].

Watford's biggest ever competitive win came in 1900, when the team defeated [[Maidenhead F.C.|Maidenhead]] 11–0 in the Southern League Second Division.&lt;ref name="wfcrecords" /&gt; The team's biggest Football League winning margin is 8–0; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 1982. Both of these matches were at home – Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most recently in the 6–1 win against Leeds United at [[Elland Road]] in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watford's 7–4 victories against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively.&lt;ref name="stattorecords"&gt;Brown, Tony.

The club's highest home attendance is 34,099, for a fourth round FA Cup match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 3 February 1969. The record home league attendance is 27,968 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in August of the same year.&lt;ref name="wfcrecords" /&gt; Watford's home capacity has since been reduced due to all-seater requirements; it currently stands at 21,577.&lt;ref name=capacity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/clubs/20100801/watford_2293498_692872|title=Watford Football Club|publisher=[[The Football League]]|accessdate=18 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421020630/http://www.football-league.co.uk/clubs/20100801/watford_2293498_692872|archivedate=21 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
