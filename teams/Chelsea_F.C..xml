'''Chelsea Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[London]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the highest tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. The club has won eight League titles, eight [[FA Cup]]s, five [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]s, four [[FA Community Shield]]s, two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]s, one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[UEFA Europa League]], and one [[UEFA Super Cup]].&lt;ref name="Chelsea win breaks London duck"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea win breaks London duck |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=1798274.html#chelseas+capital+gains |work=Union of European Football Associations |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1449255/ivanovic-goal-wins-europa-league-chelsea?cc=5901 |title=Chelsea wins Europa on Ivanovic header |publisher=ESPNFC |date=16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1947872.html |title=Chelsea join illustrious trio |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Mourinho]] is the club's most successful manager in terms of the number of major honours won, and his title-winning team set an English record for points between 2004 and 2005.{{refn|group=note|Chelsa's record number of points (95) in the 2004–05 season was broken by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (100) in the 2017–18 season.}} Chelsea have traditionally wore a royal blue kit with white socks, and the club's crest features a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff.&lt;ref name="new crest"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea centenary crest unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4008257.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club have rivalries with neighbouring clubs [[West London derby|Fulham]], [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|Arsenal]], and [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|Tottenham Hotspur]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Chelsea F.C.}}
[[File:Chelsea Team 1905.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[History of Chelsea F.C.|first Chelsea team]] in September 1905]]

In 1904, [[Gus Mears]] acquired the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea|Chelsea]] was chosen for the new club; names like ''Kensington FC'', ''Stamford Bridge FC'' and ''London FC'' were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),&lt;ref name="teamhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/1900.html|title=The Birth of a Club|publisher=Chelsea FC|date=30 September 2004|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.

The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the [[1915 FA Cup Final]], where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1800262 |title=Team History – 1905–29 |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=23 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718071312/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0%2C%2C10268~1800262%2C00.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea attracted large crowds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0,,10268~910883,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720222638/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0%2C%2C10268~910883%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2012 |title=Between the Wars – Big Names and Big Crowds |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a reputation for signing big-name players,&lt;ref name="glanville"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 January 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article992039.ece |title=Little sign of change for Chelsea and their impossible dreams |work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=15 March 2009 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years.

Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and England centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in [[1954–55 Chelsea F.C. season|1954–55]]. The following season saw UEFA create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 April 2005 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/europe/article2327902.ece |title=The great Chelsea surrender |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 December 2006 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach [[Tommy Docherty]].

[[File:ChelseaFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing the progress of Chelsea's league finishes from 1906 to the present]]

Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography – The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years|publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7553-1466-9 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, [[Dave Sexton]], Chelsea won the [[1970 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 1970]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in Athens.

The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.

[[File:Chelsea UCL Winners 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|Chelsea players celebrate their first [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League title]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] (2012).]]

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the [[1994 FA Cup Final]] with [[Glenn Hoddle]]. It was not until the appointment of [[Ruud Gullit]] as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the club [[1997 FA Cup Final|won the FA Cup in 1997]] and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who led the team to victory in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]], the [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] and the [[1998 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] in 1998, the [[2000 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2000]] and their first appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Vialli was sacked in favour of [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the [[2002 FA Cup Final]] and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.

In July 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for £140&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="takeover"/&gt; Over £100&amp;nbsp;million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea sack Ranieri |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3742477.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[José Mourinho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea appoint Mourinho |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3765263.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War ([[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/03/12/SOCCER_Chelsea.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603160253/http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F06%2F03%2F12%2FSOCCER_Chelsea.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer |archivedate=3 June 2012 |title=Terry Eyes Back-to-Back Titles |work=Sporting Life |accessdate=22 January 2007 |first=Matt |last=Barlow |date=12 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to winning an FA Cup ([[2007 FA Cup Final|2007]]) and two League Cups ([[2005 Football League Cup Final|2005]] and [[2007 Football League Cup Final|2007]]). After a poor start to the 2007–2008 season, Mourinho was replaced by [[Avram Grant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea name Grant as new manager |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7004083.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who led the club to their first [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final]], which they lost on penalties to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

[[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] took over from Grant, but was sacked after 7 months following poor results. [[Guus Hiddink]] then took over the club on an interim basis while continuing to manage the [[Russian national football team]].

[[File:Stamford Bridge - West Stand.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], West Stand]]
Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the [[London Athletic Club]] as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&amp;nbsp;acre (51,000&amp;nbsp;m²) site.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had also designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.

Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.&lt;ref name="stadium"&gt;{{cite web

In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the [[Fee simple|freehold]] being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.

When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the [[Ken Bates|Bates]] era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of ''"Chelsea Village"'' or ''"The Village"''.

The Stamford Bridge [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the [[Association football pitch|pitch]], the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===

Chelsea have had four main [[crest (sports)|crests]], which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a [[Chelsea pensioner]], the army veterans who reside at the nearby [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]. This contributed to the club's original "pensioner" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When [[Ted Drake]] became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a [[crosier|staff]]. It was based on elements in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lcc.html#chelsea%20bc
|title=Chelsea Metropolitan Borough Council
|work=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales
|accessdate=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the "lion rampant regardant" taken from the arms of then club president [[William Cadogan, 7th Earl Cadogan|Viscount Chelsea]] and the staff from the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbots of Westminster]], former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.&lt;ref name="crest"/&gt; This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s.

In 1986, with [[Ken Bates]] now owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=1980s Summary
|publisher=Chelsea FC
|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Kits – Chelsea

|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new ownership of [[Roman Abramovich]], and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.&lt;ref name="new crest"/&gt;

Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler [[eton blue]], which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, [[Earl Cadogan]], and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year.&lt;ref name="change kits"&gt;{{cite web

Chelsea Football Club were founded by [[Gus Mears]] in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when [[Ken Bates]] bought the club from Mears' great-nephew [[Brian Mears]] for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] stock exchange in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Football Clubs on the UK Stock Markets |url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_turnover_09.htm |publisher=Football Economy |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, [[Roman Abramovich]] purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30&amp;nbsp;million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140&amp;nbsp;million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the [[Matthew Harding]] estate (21%), [[BSkyB]] (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bates sells off Chelsea to a Russian billionaire |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2406994/Bates-sells-off-Chelsea-to-a-Russian-billionaire.html |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the 90% share threshold, Abramovich took the club back into private hands, delisting it from the AIM on 22 August 2003.
