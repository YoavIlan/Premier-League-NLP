'''Burnley Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|n|l|i}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition match|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885–86 in English football|1885–86]]. The club currently plays in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed ''the [[Bordeaux wine#"Claret" term|Clarets]]'', due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888–89 Football League|1888]].

Burnley have been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920–21 in English football|1920–21]] and [[1959–60 in English football|1959–60]], have won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and have won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. ''The Clarets'' also reached the [[1960–61 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. They are one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].

In the [[1920–21 Burnley F.C. season|1920–21]] campaign, Burnley were crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{ref label|Topdivision|A|}} During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by [[Nottingham Forest]] in the late 1970s. Burnley attained a second league championship in [[1959–60 Burnley F.C. season|1959–60]] with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], after foundations were laid by pioneers [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] and [[Harry Potts]].

Just twenty years later, in [[1979–80 Burnley F.C. season|1979–80]], Burnley were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] — the first time in their history they had played in the third tier of English football. Five years later, the team competed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2–1 home win against [[Orient F.C.|Orient]] saved Burnley from relegation to the [[Football Conference]] and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in [[1991–92 Burnley F.C. season|1991–92]] to the third tier and again in [[1999–2000 Burnley F.C. season|1999–2000]] to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in [[2008–09 Burnley F.C. season|2008–09]], [[2013–14 Burnley F.C. season|2013–14]] and [[2015–16 Burnley F.C. season|2015–16]].

Burnley have played home games at [[Turf Moor]] since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from their original premises at ''Calder Vale''. The club colours of [[claret]] and blue were adopted prior to the 1910–11 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Their current manager, [[Sean Dyche]], was appointed on 30 October 2012.

==History==

===Early years (1882–1912)===
[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|The Burnley team of 1889]]
On 18 May 1882, ''Burnley Rovers Football Club'' decided to shift their allegiance from [[rugby union]] to [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2016/may/on-this-day-may-18/|title=Burnley Football Club On This Day: May 18|access-date=25 December 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing in various green or blue and white kits for their first few years, the club played their first competitive game in October 1882 against ''Astley Bridge'' in the Lancashire Challenge Cup, that game ending in an 8–0 defeat.&lt;ref name=BurnleyFCMiscellany&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Burnley FC Miscellany|last=Wiseman|first=David|publisher=DB Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781780911045|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early months of 1883 the club moved to [[Turf Moor]] and remain there, only their Lancashire rivals [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] having continuously occupied the same ground for longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://memim.com/turf-moor.html|title=Turf Moor|website=memim.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley first appeared in the [[FA Cup]] in [[1885–86 in English football|1885–86]],&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014" /&gt; but were ignominiously beaten 11–0 when eligibility restrictions meant that their reserve side had to be fielded against ''Darwen Old Wanderers''.&lt;ref name=BurnleyFCMiscellany /&gt; A year later, on 13 October 1886, Turf Moor became the first ground to be visited by a member of the [[British royal family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref name=SidanPress&gt;Fiszman, Marc; Peters, Mark (2005). Kick Off Championship 2005–06. Sidan Press. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was decided to found [[the Football League]] for the [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]] season, Burnley were among the twelve founders of that competition, and one of the six clubs based in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="football league founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1888-89.html|title= England 1888–89|publisher= Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley's [[William Tait (footballer)|William Tait]] became the first player to score a [[hat-trick]] in league football in only the second match of the inaugural season, when his three goals gave ''the Clarets'' an away win to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book. p 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley, now known as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The Turfites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Moorites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or '''Royalites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' as a result of the name of their new ground and the royal connection, eventually finished 9th in the first season of the league, but only one place from bottom in [[1889–90 in English football|1889–90]], following a 17-game winless streak at the start of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1889-90.html England 1889–90] Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; That season did, however, present Burnley with their first honours, winning the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] with a 2–0 final victory over local rivals [[Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Clarets Chronicles: The Definitive History of Burnley Football Club 1882–2007|last=Simpson|first=Ray|publisher=Burnley F.C.|year=2007|isbn=9780955746802|location=|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Burnley won a trophy again, they were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first time in [[1896–97 in English football|1896–97]]. They responded to this by winning promotion the [[1897–98 in English football|next season]], losing only two of their 30 matches along the way before gaining promotion through a play-off series, then known as ''[[Football League test matches|test matches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1897-98.html England 1897–98] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205051045/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1897-98.html |date=5 February 2010 }} Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley and [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] both entered the last match, to be played between the two teams, needing a draw for promotion (or in Stoke's case to retain their First Division place). A 0–0 draw ensued, reportedly "''The match without a shot at goal''",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Football's Strangest Matches: Extraordinary but True Stories from Over a Century of Football|last=Ward|first=Andrew|publisher=Portico|year=2016|isbn=9781910232866|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the league immediately withdrew the test match system in favour of automatic promotion and relegation. Ironically, the league also decided to expand the top division after the test match series of [[1897–98 in English football|1897–98]] and the other two teams also went into the top division for the following year, negating the effect of Burnley and Stoke City's reputed collusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1898-99.html England 1898–99] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205051026/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1898-99.html |date=5 February 2010 }} Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley were relegated again in [[1899–1900 in English football|1899–1900]] and found themselves at the centre of a controversy when their goalkeeper, [[Jack Hillman]] attempted to bribe their opponents, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in the last match of the season, resulting in his suspension for the whole of the following season. It was the earliest recorded case of [[match fixing]] in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/09/theknowledge.sport|title=The earliest recorded case of match-fixing|last=Dart|first=James|last2=Bandini|first2=Paolo|date=9 August 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decade of the 20th century, Burnley continued to play in the Second Division, even finishing in bottom place in one season, although the indications of success just around the corner were evident. Burnley changed their colours from green to the claret and sky blue of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], the most successful club in England at the time, for the [[1910–11 in English football|1910–11]] season, as manager [[John Haworth]] believed it might bring a change of fortune.&lt;ref name="historicalkits"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Burnley/Burnley.htm|title=Burnley – Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/edw1/100_years_of_claret_and_blue__part_1_747385/index.shtml|title=100 Years of Claret and Blue – Part 1 – Clarets Mad|last=|first=|date=|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tides did indeed turn the [[1911–12 in English football|following season]], when only a loss in the last game of the season denied the club promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/fla/1911-12.html|title=England 1911/12|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarets' glory either side of World War I (1912–1930)===
[[File:The King George V presents the FA Cup 1914.jpg|thumb|left|230px|King George V presents the 1914 FA Cup trophy to Burnley captain Tommy Boyle.]]
[[File:Burnley F.C. 1920-21.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The team photograph of the Championship-winning side in the 1920–21 season.]]
Burnley continued to improve, as the [[1912–13 in English football|1912–13]] season saw them win promotion to the First Division once more, as well as reaching the [[FA Cup]] semi-final, only to lose to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. The next season was one of consolidation in the top flight, but more importantly their first major honour, the FA Cup, was won, against fellow Lancastrians [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the final ([[1914 FA Cup Final|1–0]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/burnley-defeat-liverpool-in-fa-cup-final|title=Burnley defeat Liverpool in FA Cup Final {{!}} Century Ireland|website=www.rte.ie|language=en|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-[[Everton F.C.|Evertonian]] [[Bert Freeman]], whose father travelled from Australia to see his son play in the final,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2014/april/families-of-burnleys-1914-heroes-join-in-the-turf-moor-celebrations/|title=Families of Burnley’s 1914 heroes join in the Turf Moor celebrations|last=Simpson|first=Ray|date=28 April 2014|work=Burnley Football Club|access-date=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; scored the only goal, as Burnley became the first club to beat five First Division clubs in one cup season.&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014" /&gt; This was the last final to be played at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] became the first reigning monarch to present the cup to the winning captain, in this case to [[Tommy Boyle (footballer, born 1886)|Tommy Boyle]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014"&gt;Smith, Mike. ''The Road to Glory: Burnley's FA Cup Triumph in 1914''. Grosvenor House Publishing Limited, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning Burnley team also got special medals with "''English Cup Winners''" written on it instead of the usual "''FA Cup Winners''" inscription.&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/8800834.Burnley_player_s_1914_FA_Cup_medal_up_for_grabs/|title=Burnley player's 1914 FA Cup medal up for grabs|website=Lancashire Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I impacted the [[1914–15 in English football|1914–15]] season, in which Burnley finished 4th in the First Division, before English football reorganised itself and took a back seat to the needs of the conflict. Upon resumption of full-time football in [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20]], Burnley finished second in the First Division to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], but this was not a peak, merely presaging Burnley's first ever League Championship in [[1920–21 Burnley F.C. season|1920–21]].&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1920-21.html|title= England 1920–21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205195213/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1920-21.html |archivedate=5 February 2010|publisher= Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley lost their opening three matches that season before going on a 30-match unbeaten run, a record for unbeaten games in a single season that lasted until [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] went unbeaten through the whole of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061212/http://www.givemefootball.com/club-list/burnley|title=Burnley News &amp; Players {{!}} The Clarets {{!}} Give Me Football|date=1 January 2011|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley finished third the following season, but thereafter followed a steady deterioration of their position, with only 5th place in [[1926–27 in English football|1926–27]] offering respite from a series of near-relegations which culminated in demotion in [[1929–30 in English football|1929–30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1929-30.html|title=England 1929/30|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low points through World War II (1930–1945)===
Burnley struggled in English football's second tier, narrowly avoiding a further relegation in [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32]] by only two points. The years through to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] were characterised by uninspiring league finishes, broken only by a FA Cup semi-final appearance in [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]] and the arrival (and equally swift departure) of [[English Football Hall of Fame]] inductee and centre-forward [[Tommy Lawton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-tommy-lawton-1351115.html|title=Obituary: Tommy Lawton|date=7 November 1996|work=The Independent|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley participated in the varying football leagues that continued throughout the war, but it wasn't until the [[1946–47 in English football|1946–47]] season that league football proper was restored.

===Golden, progressive era under Bob Lord, Alan Brown and Harry Potts (1946–1976)===
In the [[1946–47 Football League|first season]] of post-war league football, Burnley gained promotion through second place in the Second Division. Additionally, there was a run to the [[FA Cup Final]], with [[Aston Villa]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] being defeated before [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] beat Burnley [[1947 FA Cup Final|1–0 after extra time]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1426045.No_17__1947_FA_Cup_final/|title=No 17: 1947 FA Cup final|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley immediately made an impact the top division, finishing third in [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48]] as the club began to assemble a team capable of regularly aiming for honours.

Burnley became one of the most progressive clubs around from the following decade, the 1950s, to the early 1970s under the reign of lifelong Burnley supporter and newly appointed chairman [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]].&lt;ref name=footballerpink&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://footballpink.net/2015/12/20/the-khrushchev-of-burnley/|title=The Khrushchev of Burnley|date=20 December 2015|access-date=24 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gameofthepeople"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameofthepeople.com/2013/08/09/great-reputations-burnley-1959-60-a-good-year-for-claret/|title=Great Reputations: Burnley 1959–60 – a good year for claret|website=Game of the People|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first teams to build a training ground, while most teams trained on public parks or at their own grounds.&lt;ref name=footballerpink /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5206703/Burnley-legend-Jimmy-Robson-talks-winning-title.html|title=Jimmy Robson talks about winning the title and playing in Europe|work=Mail Online|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the club became, after foundations were laid by Lord and manager [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Football Man: People &amp; Passions in Soccer|last=Hopcraft|first=Arthur|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|year=2013|isbn=978-1781311516|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/burnley_fc/news/1422640.John_Connelly_life_story__Part_1/|title=John Connelly life story: Part 1|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; renowned for their youth policy and scouting system, which yielded many young players over the years such as club legends [[Jimmy McIlroy]], [[Willie Morgan]] and [[Martin Dobson]].&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Never Had it So Good: Burnley's Incredible 1959/60 League Title Triumph|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781848186002|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/midweek-clarets-legends-this-week-its-harry-potts/8537710/|title=Midweek Clarets' Legends - This Week it's Harry Potts|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|work=sport.co.uk|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his relatively short spell at the club from 1954 to 1957, Brown also introduced short corners and a huge array of free kick routines, which were soon copied across the land.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stuart.

Burnley endured a tense 1959–60 season in which [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] were the other protagonists in the chase for the league title, but the club ultimately clinched their second league championship on the last day of the season at [[Maine Road]], [[Manchester]] with a 2–1 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] with goals from [[Brian Pilkington (footballer)|Brian Pilkington]] and [[Trevor Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/14567385._We_weren_t_jumping_around__we_d_only_won_the_league____Burnley_legend_on_the_day_the_Clarets_were_crowned_Kings_of_England/|title='We weren't jumping around, we'd only won the league' – Burnley legend on the day the Clarets were crowned Kings of England|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed23/manchester_city_v_burnley__the_championship_2nd_may_1960_27806/index.shtml|title=Manchester City v Burnley – The Championship, 2nd May 1960 – Clarets Mad|last=|first=|date=|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had been in contention all season, Burnley had never led the table until this last match was played out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedaisycutter.co.uk/2013/08/the-forgotten-giants-of-turf-moor/|title=The Forgotten Giants of Turf Moor – The Daisy Cutter|date=9 August 2013|work=The Daisy Cutter|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potts had only used eighteen players throughout the whole season, as [[John Connelly (footballer)|John Connelly]] became Burnley's top scorer with 20 goals.&lt;ref name="FootballTimes" /&gt; The Lancastrians' title-winning squad costed just £13,000 in transfer fees too — £8,000 on McIlroy in 1950 and £5,000 on left-back [[Alex Elder]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good" /&gt; The other players of the squad each came from the Burnley youth academy.&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gameofthepeople" /&gt; After the season finished, Burnley went to the United States to participate in the inaugural international football tournament in North America, the [[International Soccer League]].&lt;ref name=sportsworld&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/david-and-goliath-and-burnley/|title=David and Goliath and Burnley|date=14 October 2014|work=NBC SportsWorld|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of Burnley F.C. internationals}}

Burnley had, due to their success, several players with international caps in this period, including, for [[England national football team|England]] [[Ray Pointer]] (3 caps), [[Colin McDonald (footballer, born 1930)|Colin McDonald]] (8 caps), and John Connelly (20 caps), a member of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads|1966 World Cup squad]], for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] Jimmy McIlroy (55 caps) and for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] [[Adam Blacklaw]] (3 caps).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/may/international-honours-board-update/|title=International Honours Board Update|last=|first=|date=26 May 2017|work=Burnley Football Club|access-date=16 August 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, although far from a two-man team, the controversial departure of McIlroy to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and retirement of Adamson coincided with a decline in fortunes. Adamson reputedly turned down the England manager's post which then went to former Ipswich manager [[Alf Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/895440/fa-wanted-clarets-legend-jimmy-adamson-before-alf-ramsey/|title=FA wanted Clarets legend Jimmy Adamson before Alf Ramsey|date=9 November 2011|work=The Sun|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more damaging for Burnley was the impact of the abolition of the [[Maximum wage#Association football|maximum wage]] in 1961, meaning clubs from small towns, e.g. Burnley, could no longer compete financially with teams from bigger towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.efl.com/news/2016/january/fifty-five-years-to-the-day-20-maximum-wage-cap-abolished-by-football-league-clubs/|title=EFL Official Website Fifty-five years to the day: £20 maximum wage cap abolished by Football League clubs|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; They managed, however, to retain their First Division place throughout the decade finishing third in [[1965–66 in English football|1965–66]], with [[Willie Irvine]] becoming the league's [[List of English football first tier top scorers|top goal scorer]] that season,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html|title=English League Leading Goalscorers|first=|date=|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching the semi-final of the League Cup in [[1968–69 Football League Cup|1968–69]]. They had also reached the quarter-finals of the [[1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1966–67 Fairs Cup]], in which they were knocked out by German side [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/burnley-v-eintracht-frankfurt-18-april-1967-308145/|title=Burnley v Eintracht Frankfurt, 18 April 1967|work=11v11.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the decade was otherwise one of mid-table mediocrity, with Potts being replaced by Adamson as manager in 1970 after a 12-year spell.&lt;ref name=independant.co.uk&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-adamson-footballer-and-manager-who-led-burnley-to-their-greatest-successes-6259534.html|title=Jimmy Adamson: Footballer and manager who led Burnley to their greatest successes|last=|first=|date=10 November 2011|work=The Independent|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson was unable to halt the slide and relegation followed in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]] ending a long unbroken top flight spell of 24 consecutive seasons during which, more often than not, they had been in the upper reaches of the league table.

Burnley won the Second Division title in [[1972–73 in English football|1972–73]] with Adamson still in charge. As a result, they were invited to play in the [[1973 FA Charity Shield]] where they emerged as winners against the reigning holders of the shield, [[Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engsupcuphist.html|title=England – List of FA Charity/Community Shield Matches|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the First Division, led by elegant playmaker [[Martin Dobson]], the side managed to finish 6th in [[1973–74 in English football|1974]] as well as reaching another FA Cup semi-final; this time losing out to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/caught-in-time-burnley-return-to-the-first-division-1973-74-gqtvwgx3hmh|title=Caught in Time: Burnley return to the First Division, 1973 74|last=Struthers|first=Greg|date=2 May 2004|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season the club achieved 10th place, despite Dobson being sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] early in that season, but were victims of one of the great FA Cup shocks of all time when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], then in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], beat Burnley 1–0 at Turf Moor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/7704913.stm|title=Cup magic back in Wimbledon|date=7 November 2008|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relegation from the First Division in 1975–76 saw the end of Adamson's tenure as manager.&lt;ref name="independant.co.uk" /&gt;

===Decline and near oblivion (1976–1987)===

Three nondescript seasons in the Second Division followed before relegation to the Third Division for the first time in [[1979–80 Burnley F.C. season|1979–80]]. Of 42 league games, Burnley could not manage a win in either their first or last 16. Two seasons later, now under the management of [[Brian Miller (footballer)|Brian Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/17/guardianobituaries.football|title=Obituary: Brian Miller|last=Glanville|first=Brian|date=17 May 2007|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were promoted as [[1981–82 Burnley F.C. season|champions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk/final/f1981-82.html#d3|title=1981–82 Season Final Football Tables|website=www.englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this return was short-lived, lasting only one year; albeit a year in which the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and the semi-final of the League Cup, recording victories over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the latter, although the 1–0 win over Liverpool in the League Cup semi-final second leg was not enough for an appearance in the final as Burnley had lost the first leg 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blindmangallopinghorse.blogspot.com/2011/06/classic-match-report-liverpool-3.html |title=A blind man on a galloping horse...: Classic Match Report: Liverpool 3 Burnley 0, 1983 League Cup Semi Final 1st Leg |publisher=Blindmangallopinghorse.blogspot.com |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managerial changes continued to be made in an unsuccessful search for success; Miller was replaced by [[Frank Casper (footballer)|Frank Casper]] in early 1983, he by [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] before the 1983–84 season and Bond himself by [[John Benson (footballer, born 1942)|John Benson]] a season later.&lt;ref name=soccerbasemanagers&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=435&amp;teamTabs=managers|title=Burnley Manager History {{!}} Past &amp; Present {{!}} Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the fourth level of English football for the first time ever at the end of the [[1984–85 Burnley F.C. season|1984–85]] season. [[Martin Buchan]] (briefly) and then [[Tommy Cavanagh]] saw the side through the [[1985–86 Burnley F.C. season|1985–86]] season before Miller returned for the [[1986–87 Burnley F.C. season|1986–87]] season, the last match of which is known as '''The Orient Game''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=PitchPublishing17&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Orient to the Emirates: The Plucky Rise of Burnley FC|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9781785313127|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1986–87 season, the Football League had decided to introduce automatic relegation and promotion between the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] and the [[National League (division)|Conference league]], the top tier of non-league football. Although, in retrospect, this has only served to blur the lines between professional and semi-professional leagues in England, at the time it was perceived that teams losing league status might never recover from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/24/so-youve-been-relegated-from-league-two-what-happens-next|title=So you've been relegated from League Two.

A 2–1 win, with goals from [[Neil Grewcock]] and [[Ian Britton (Scottish footballer)|Ian Britton]], was enough to keep Burnley in Division Four, although even that achievement still relied on a loss by [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in their last game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/sport/football/clarets/the-match-that-lasted-a-lifetime-1-1697160|title=The match that lasted a lifetime|website=www.burnleyexpress.net|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had Burnley been relegated, the club would have probably been dissolved.&lt;ref name=footballnetwork.net&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st103252.htm|title='The Orient Game'|work=TheLongside.co.uk|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery (1987–2000)===
In May 1988, Burnley were back at Wembley; this time to play [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] in the final of the [[Football League Trophy]]. A capacity crowd of 80,000 people packed Wembley was a record for a match between two teams from English football's fourth tier, as Wolves won [[1988 Football League Trophy Final|2–0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4804537.Sherpa_final_a_turning_point_in_Burnley_s_history/|title=Sherpa final a turning point in Burnley's history|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1991–92 Burnley F.C. season|1991–92]], Burnley were champions in the last ever season of the Fourth Division before the league reorganisation. By winning the Fourth Division title, ''the Clarets'' became only the second club to have won all top four professional divisions of English football and the team is currently one of five clubs to have achieved this feat, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12038/10868826/martin-tylers-stats-most-own-goals-fewest-different-scorers-in-a-season|title=Martin Tyler's stats: Most own goals, fewest different scorers in a season|last=|first=|date=|work=Sky Sports|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993–94 Burnley F.C. season|Two years later]] they won the new Division Two play-offs and gained promotion to Division One under [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]].

Burnley immediately made an impact, as during the [[2000–01 Burnley F.C. season|2000–01]] and [[2001–02 Burnley F.C. season|2001–02]] seasons, they emerged as serious contenders for a promotion play-off place. By [[2002–03 Burnley F.C. season|2002–03]], the side's form had declined despite a good FA Cup run, where they reached the quarter-finals. This was repeated the [[2003–04 Burnley F.C. season|following season]] and in June 2004, Ternent's six years as manager came to an end, narrowly avoiding relegation in his last season. [[Steve Cotterill]] was then appointed as manager of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/03/newsstory.burnley|title=Cotterill lands Burnley job|last=Association|first=Press|date=3 June 2004|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotterill's first year in charge produced two notable cup runs, knocking out [[Premier League]] clubs [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and a 13th-place finish in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. He was not able to improve on this the following season, as Burnley finished 17th.

Burnley made a good start to the [[2006–07 Burnley F.C. season|2006–07]] campaign, but their form tailed away badly shortly before Christmas, leaving them threatened by relegation. The squad set a club record for consecutive league games without a win, with their game against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] being the 18th one of the season (19 including a cup game), meaning they had gone one fixture further than the 17 league game streak of the 1889–90 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/burnley_fc/news/11306817.Ade_Akinbiyi__Coyle_was_able_to_lift_everyone_when_he_took_the_Clarets_up/|title=Ade Akinbiyi: Coyle was able to lift everyone when he took the Clarets up|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of draws and losses was finally broken in April, as Burnley beat [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] 4–0 at Turf Moor. After that, a short run of good form in the final weeks of the competition saw Burnley finish comfortably above the relegation places, ensuring that they remained in the Championship.

The following season Burnley's poor early-season results led to the departure of manager Steve Cotterill in November 2007. His replacement was [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] manager [[Owen Coyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/22/newsstory.burnley|title=Burnley announce appointment of Owen Coyle as their new manager|last=|first=|date=22 November 2007|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coyle subsequently led the team to a total of 62 points for the [[2007–08 Burnley F.C. season|2007–08]] season, their largest total for eight years. Coyle's [[2008–09 Burnley F.C. season|first full season]] in charge ended with ''the Clarets''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' highest league finish since 1976, fifth in the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportige.com/wolves-birmingham-burnley/|title=Wolves, Birmingham and Burnley – Club Profiles {{!}} Sportige|website=sportige.com|language=en-US|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was enough to qualify the club for the Championship play-offs. Burnley beat [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 3–0 on aggregate in the semi-final, and the team went on to beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1–0 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium]], promoting Burnley to the [[Premier League]], a return to the top flight after 33 years. [[Wade Elliott]] scored the vital goal in a match known as "''The £50,000,000 final''", due to the increased revenues available to Premiership clubs after the agreement of substantially higher TV rights payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8060970.stm|title=Burnley 1–0 Sheff Utd |date=25 September 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Burnley reached the semi-final of the League Cup for the first time in over 25 years, after beating local clubs [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and London-based clubs [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/03/burnley-arsenal-premier-league|title=Carling Cup: Arsene Wenger fumes as Burnley turf out Arsenal|last=Cross|first=Jeremy|date=3 December 2008|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-finals they faced another London club and an old foe, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and Burnley lost the first leg 4–1.

[[File:Sean Dyche.jpg|thumb|175px|Manager Sean Dyche, who was appointed in October 2012.]]
Before the start of the [[2013–14 Burnley F.C. season|2013–14]] season, Burnley were tipped as one of the relegation candidates, as Dyche had to work with a tight budget and a small squad, and they had lost top goal scorer [[Charlie Austin]] to Championship rivals [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11708/11098322/sean-dyches-five-years-at-burnley|title=Sean Dyche's five years at Burnley|last=|first=|date=|work=Sky Sports|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They finished, however, second and were automatically promoted back to the Premier League in Dyche's first full season in charge, as the new strike partnership of [[Danny Ings]] (who also won the [[EFL Awards|''Championship Player of the Year'' award]]) and [[Sam Vokes]] had 41 league goals between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/sport/football/clarets/danny-ings-agrees-move-to-liverpool-1-7298163|title=Danny Ings agrees move to Liverpool|last=|first=|date=|work=Burnley Express|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dyche only used 23 players throughout the season, which was the joint-lowest in the division, and he only paid a transfer fee for one player since his appointment — £400,000 on striker [[Ashley Barnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/27016258|title=Burnley 2–0 Wigan Athletic|last=|first=|date=21 April 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; But yet again, their stay in the Premier League only lasted a single season as they finished [[2014–15 Burnley F.C. season|19th out of 20]] clubs and were subsequently relegated. Burnley went yet one better than their previous time in the Championship and won the division in [[2015–16 Burnley F.C. season|2015–16]], equaling their club record of 93 points of 2013–14, ending the season with a run of 23 league games undefeated.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Orient to the Emirates: The Plucky Rise of Burnley FC|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9781785313127|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyche used just 25 players during the season this time, and new signing [[Andre Gray]] finished as the league's [[EFL Championship#Top scorers|top goal scorer]] with 25 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5159769/Burnley-Sean-Dyche-praises-Watford-striker-Andre-Gray.html|title=Sean Dyche praises Andre Gray ahead of Turf Moor return|work=Mail Online|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a combination of excellent home form with poor away results, Burnley finished the [[2016–17 Burnley F.C. season|2016–17]] season in 16th place, six points above the relegation zone, and were thus ensured to play consecutive seasons in the top flight for the first time since [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/15285311.Burnley__39_s_safety_is_confirmed_as_Hull_City_lose_at_Crystal_Palace/|title=Burnley's safety is confirmed as Hull City lose at Crystal Palace|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2017–18 Burnley F.C. season|following season]] started off with an away win to defending champions Chelsea (3–2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40835426|title=Chelsea 2–3 Burnley|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC Sport|access-date=|publication-date=12 August 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a start signal for a reversed away form, as Burnley finished the season with more points collected on the road than at home. Moreover, Burnley's home form continued to be strong too, drawing against eventual inexpugnable league champions and record breakers [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (1–1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42842351|title=Burnley 1–1 Manchester City|last=|first=|date=3 February 2018|work=BBC Sport|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley ultimately secured an unexpected 7th place at the end of the season, their highest league finish since [[1973–74 Football League|1973–74]], and thus qualified for the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League]], meaning they qualified for a competitive European competition for the first time in 51 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44018738|title=Burnley secure European football for first time in 51 years|date=5 May 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their European tour, however, already ended in August, as they crashed out in the play-offs against Greek side [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], after they had eliminated Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Turkish side [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.|İstanbul Başakşehir]] in the previous rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45350947|title=Burnley 1–1 Olympiakos (2–4 on agg)|last=|first=|date=30 August 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=31 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairman Mike Garlick holds 49.24% of outstanding shares of Burnley F.C. and Member of the [[Board of Directors]] John Banaszkiewicz another 28.2%. The other five Members of the Board hold, between them, a total of 16.36%. The total holding of shares by all Board members amounts to 93.8%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/club/contact/ Board of Directors], Burnley FC&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley is one of the few clubs in the top two tiers who are British-owned. Every director at the club is locally born, a ''Claret'' supporter and none of them are getting paid. As of 2018–19, the club is debt-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4975022/Brendan-Flood-reveals-secrets-Burnley-s-success.html|title=Burnley's secret and a choppy helicopter ride with Neville and Giggs|last=|first=|date=|work=Mail Online|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Kits, colours and crest ==

=== Kits and colours ===
In the early years, various designs and colours were used by Burnley. Throughout their first eight years these were various permutations of blue and white. After three years of claret and amber stripes with black shorts, for much of the 1890s a combination of black with amber stripes was used, although the club wore a shirt with pink and white stripes during the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95]] season. Between 1897 and 1900 the club used a plain red shirt and from 1900 until 1910 the club changed to an all green shirt with white shorts. In 1910 the club changed their colours to claret and sky blue, the colours that they have now had for the majority of their history, save for a spell in white shirts and black shorts during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The adoption of the claret and sky blue colour combination were a homage to league champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], who wore those colours. The Burnley committee and manager [[John Haworth]] believed it might bring a change of fortune.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Burnley's away kit for the [[2006–07 Burnley F.C. season|2006–07]] season, a yellow shirt with claret bar, yellow shorts and yellow socks, won the ''Best Kit Design'' award at the [[EFL Awards|Football League Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/1238010.Clarets_win_kit_award/|title=Clarets win kit award|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2007–08 Burnley F.C. season|following season]], a new home kit was released, echoing the 1950s shirt; all claret with a blue v-neck and rims on the end of the arms which sport the word '''Burnley''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. It featured gold trim and a new gold logo for the club's 125th anniversary. For the Championship match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 24 November 2007, Burnley wore a commemorative 125th anniversary shirt based on their first kit; blue and white stripes with black trim/shorts and white socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2007-2008/championship.html|title=The Championship 2007–2008 – Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2009–10 Burnley F.C. season|2009–10]] season, the club wore a kit similar to the kit worn when Burnley won the old First Division title (i.e. what is now the Premier League title) in [[1959–60 Burnley F.C. season|1959–60]], to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that achievement.

Since 2010, Burnley's kits have been manufactured by [[Puma (brand)|Puma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/business/4864368.Burnley_sign_new_Puma_kit_deal/|title=Burnley sign new Puma kit deal|last=|first=|date=21 January 2010|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous manufacturers include [[Umbro]] (1975–81), Spall (1981–87, 1988–89), En-s (1987–88), Ellgren (1989–91), Ribero (1991–93), [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] (1993–96), [[Adidas]] (1996–99), Super League (1999–2002), TFG Sports (2002–05), and [[Erreà]] (2005–10).&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The clubs shirts are currently sponsored by LaBa360.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soccerex.com/insight/articles/2018/burnley-announce-record-breaking-shirt-sponsor-deal|title=Burnley announce ‘record-breaking’ shirt sponsor deal|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=24 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous shirt sponsors include POCO (1982–83), [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB]] (1983–84), [[Multipart Solutions|Multipart]] (1984–88), [[Endsleigh Insurance|Endsleigh]] (1988–98), P3 Computers (1998–2000), Lanway (2001–04), Hunters (2004–07), [[Holland's Pies|Holland's]] (2007–09), Cooke (2009–10), Fun88 (2010–12, 2014–15), Premier Range (2012–14), [[Oak Furniture Land]] (2015–16), and [[Dafabet]] (2016–18).&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt;

=== Crest ===
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|The Royal Arms]]
''The Clarets''' first recorded usage of a crest was on 17 December 1887, when they wore the [[Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales' coat of arms]] on their shirt.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The Prince of Wales visited Turf Moor a year before when Burnley was playing Bolton Wanderers, which was the first ever visit by a member of the [[British royal family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Fiszman, Marc; Peters, Mark (2005). Kick Off Championship 2005–06. Sidan Press. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Burnley were presented a set of white jerseys featuring a blue sash and embellished with the Prince of Wales' coat of arms to commemorate the visit, making ''the Clarets'' the first ever club to have the right to wear it on their shirts.&lt;ref name=claretsmad.co.uk&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed93/ask_clarets_mad_answers_7_108144/index.shtml|title=Ask Clarets Mad Answers 7 – Clarets Mad|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club would regularly wear the royal crest until the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95]] season. Twenty years later, when Burnley played the [[1914 FA Cup Final]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was in attendance, the Royal Arms featured once again on the ''claret and blue'' shirts.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; 

A forerunner of the club's current badge was first recorded in 1935. 25 years later, when Burnley won the league title for a second time, they were allowed to wear the town's crest of the period on their shirts.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed93/ask_clarets_mad_answers_7_108144/index.shtml|title=Ask Clarets Mad Answers 7 – Clarets Mad|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town's crest was worn until the [[1969–70 Football League|1969–70]] season, when it was replaced with a simple "''BFC''". Six years later, the initials were lettered with gold. Four seasons after that, the club used a new designed badge based on the town's crest, before returning to a horizontal version of the "''BFC''" initials in 1983, which were lettered in white this time.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; In the [[1987–88 Burnley F.C. season|1987–88]] season they returned to their former, new designed crest.

The latest major change to the club crest came in the [[2009–10 Burnley F.C. season|2009–10]] season. To mark Burnley's first ever season in the [[Premier League]], since the rebranding of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1992, and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club's 1959–60 First Division league title win, Burnley decided to return to the crest used in that title winning season.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; [[2010–11 Burnley F.C. season|The following season]], the town's Latin motto "''Pretiumque Et Causa Laboris''" (English translation: "''The prize and the cause of our labour''") was replaced with the inscription "''Burnley Football Club''".&lt;ref name=sbnation&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/1/16/7557207/burnley-badge-premier-league|title=Burnley's badge is the best in the Premier League|work=SBNation.com|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley's current badge is based on the town's crest and many components of the badge — depicting cotton, history, industry, royalty — have their origins in the history of the club, the town [[Burnley]] and surrounding areas and the components thus refer to them.&lt;ref name=sbnation /&gt;

==Club mascot==
The club's mascot is ''Bertie Bee''. Dressed in a bee suit, he wears the Burnley home kit with shirt number 1882 and is popular with the Burnley fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10209230.Video__Film_shows_day_in_the_life_of_Clarets_mascot_Bertie_Bee/|title=Video: Film shows day in the life of Clarets mascot Bertie Bee|last=|first=|date=|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known nationwide for rugby tackling a streaker on the pitch at Turf Moor who had evaded the stewards during a match against local rivals Preston in 2002, and appeared on the BBC Television sporting panel show [[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|''They Think It's All Over'']] after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/news/offbeat/video-bertie-bee-how-rugby-tackling-a-streaker-changed-my-career-1-3180956|title=VIDEO: Bertie Bee – how rugby tackling a streaker changed my career|website=www.burnleyexpress.net|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006–07 season, he was joined by [[Holland's Pies]] mascot ''Stan the Pie Man'', due to a sponsorship deal.&lt;ref name=BurnleyFCMiscellany2014&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burnley FC Miscellany: Everything you ever needed to know about The Clarets|last=Clayton|first=David|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781445642239|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, he again hit the headlines, this time after a top of the table clash against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]], when he was sent off and 'jailed' after he jokingly offered the assistant referee a pair of glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/burnley-mascot-sent-jailed-after-2644050|title=Burnley mascot sent off and 'jailed' after offering official his glasses|last=Richards|first=Alex|date=26 October 2013|work=mirror|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1886, Turf Moor welcomed the first-ever visit by a member of the [[Royal family|Royal Family]] to a first-class association football match at a senior ground, when [[Queen Victoria]]'s grandson, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], was in attendance for a match between Burnley and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/december/the-story-of-the-dr-dean-trophy/|title=The Story Of The Dr Dean Trophy|last=Simpson|first=Ray|date=5 December 2017|work=Burnley Football Club|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, the first Football League match at Turf Moor was an encounter against the same opposition, Bolton, with Burnley emerging as 4–1 winners, [[Fred Poland]] scoring the first competitive league goal at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Football League: The First Season 1888/89|last=Metcalf|first=Mark|publisher=Amberley Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1445618814|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1921–22 FA Cup|1922]], the ground hosted its only [[FA Cup semi-finals|FA Cup semi-final]] to date, between [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], and five years later it hosted its only senior international match, between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] for the [[British Home Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=158|title=England 1–2 Wales, British Home Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=englandstats.com|language=en-UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turf Moor site was first used for sport in 1833, when [[Burnley Cricket Club]] was established. Fifty years later, they invited Burnley Football Club to move from their original premises at ''Calder Vale'' to a pitch adjacent to the cricket field.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burden |first1=Brian |last2=Morse |first2=Blair |title=The Sports Tourists' Guide to the English Premier League |publisher=BookBaby |year=2018 |isbn=978-1543919554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885.&lt;ref name=footballstadiumsweb&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.football-stadiums.co.uk/grounds/england/turf-moor/|title=Turf Moor|date=|work=Football Stadiums|access-date=16 June 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now consists of 4 stands, the James Hargreaves Stand (''The Longside''), the [[Jimmy McIlroy]] Stand (''Bee Hole End''), the Bob Lord Stand and the Ladbrokes Stand (''The Cricket Field Stand'') for home and away fans. The current capacity is 21,944 all-seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/43/Burnley/stadium|title=Turf Moor Burnley FC, Info &amp; Map {{!}} Premier League|website=www.premierleague.com|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-World War I crowds in the stadium averaged in the 30,000–40,000 range with the record attendance set in 1924 against Huddersfield Town in a FA Cup match when 54,755 attended the match.&lt;ref name=BurnleypremiumTV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10413~1031447,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309101845/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10413~1031447,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 March 2008|title=The Turf Moor Story {{!}} Burnley {{!}} Club {{!}} History {{!}} History|date=9 March 2008|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 23 February 1960, in a fifth round FA Cup replay against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], there was an official reported attendance of 52,850 at the Turf. Some of the gates were, however, broken down and many uncounted fans poured into the ground. Many supporters were also locked out, and the road from Bradford over the Moss at [[Colne]] had to be closed to traffic.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st112457.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1974, ''The Turf'' had a slight slope in the field, when chairman Bob Lord made a resolution to relay the pitch and to remove the slope.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when ''The Longside'' and ''Bee Hole End'' terraces were replaced by all-seater stands as a result of the [[Taylor Report]], reducing the capacity in the process.&lt;ref name=footballstadiumsweb /&gt;

In 2008, plans were made to extend the stadium to a capacity of around 28,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/burnley/5386898/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-Burnley.html|title=10 things you probably didn't know about Burnley|last=Smith|first=Rory|date=26 May 2009|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity increase would include a second tier attached to the Bob Lord stand, along with a complete re-development of the stand. In addition, a new stand was planned to replace the Cricket Field Stand, which would also hold a cricket pavilion and hotel. In late 2008, these plans were put on hold as general economic conditions worsened in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pitchcare.com/news-media/a-drop-of-claret.html|title=A Drop of Claret {{!}} Pitchcare|website=www.pitchcare.com|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of 2017, Burnley finalised plans to develop two corners of the stadium (between the Jimmy McIlroy stand and both the James Hargreaves and Bob Lord stands) to provide better facilities for disabled supporters to meet the ''Accessible Stadium Guide'' (ASG) regulations.&lt;ref name=December2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/december/disabled-to-get-new-facilities-in-turf-moor-facelift/|title=Burnley Football Club Disabled Fans To Get New Facilities In Turf Moor Facelift|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans took the spending on infrastructure at the club to around £20m in two years, including a bigger club shop and ticket office at the stadium, and a major uplift to their training centre.

At the same time, however, the club concluded that "there will be no other ground developments to increase the overall capacity of Turf Moor in the short-term, unless an increase in demand for seats forces a re-think."&lt;ref name=December2017 /&gt;

When falling down to the lower leagues and the simultaneously growing presence of [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|hooliganism in English football]] in the 1980s, a [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firm]] linked to Burnley was established, called the "''[[Suicide Squad (hooligan firm)|Suicide Squad]]"'', which became infamous for violently clashing with many other firms and fans in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suicide Squad: The Inside Story of a Football Firm|last=Porter|first=Andrew|publisher=Milo Books|year=2005|isbn=9781903854464|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also featured in the television documentary series ''[[The Real Football Factories]]'' presented by [[Danny Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/318191/thugs-jailed-over-football-gang-fight/|title=Thugs jailed over football gang fight|date=19 January 2011|work=The Sun|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squad officially disbanded in 2009 after a high-profile incident with supporters of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], in which afterwards twelve members of the ''Suicide Squad'' were sentenced to jail for a total of 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/8797259.Burnley__Suicide_Squad__hooligans_jailed_for_32_years/|title=Burnley 'Suicide Squad' hooligans jailed for 32 years|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivalries ===
{{Main|East Lancashire derby}}
In an unofficial ''Football Rivalry Survey'' from 2012–13, Burnley were listed 7th out of a list of 92 respective Football League clubs with the most rivals, with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] considering Burnley to be their main rival and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] considering them their second main rival.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/2012-football-rivalry-census-results/|title=2012–13 Football Rivalry Survey Results|date=28 August 2012|work=The Chris Whiting Show|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocally, Burnley considers their biggest rivalry to be with Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/more-game-blackburn-vs-burnley|title=More Than A Game: Blackburn vs Burnley|date=1 May 2005|work=FourFourTwo|access-date=23 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thedailycutter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedaisycutter.co.uk/2012/09/football-rivalries-the-survey/|title=Football Rivalries: The Survey – The Daisy Cutter|date=14 September 2012|work=The Daisy Cutter|access-date=23 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games between them are known as the ''[[East Lancashire derby|East Lancashire Derby]]'', named after the region both clubs hail from, and it is known as one of the longest standing derbies in world football, as both clubs are founder members of the [[English Football League|Football League]] and have won the [[List of English football champions|First Division]] and the [[FA Cup]]. 

The two clubs are separated by fourteen miles (22.5 kilometres) and besides the geographical proximity, the clubs have a long-standing history of fierce rivalry too; their first competitive clash being a Football League match in 1888, in the [[1888–89 Football League|inaugural season]] of the competition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Blackburn%20Rovers/|title=Burnley football club: record v Blackburn Rovers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.11v11.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years earlier, however, they had met for the first time, although in an alleged ''pre-league friendly'', with considerable pride at stake.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/4668181.History_of_the_Blackburn_Rovers_v_Burnley_derby__part_one/|title=History of the Blackburn Rovers v Burnley derby: part one|last=|first=|date=|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the ''pre-league friendlies'', there have been 113 matches played between both, with Burnley having the slightly better head-to-head record of the two teams, ''the Clarets'' winning 48 games and Blackburn 45.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Burnley's closest geographic rival is actually [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] but, as they have never competed at the same level (although defunct club [[Accrington F.C.|Accrington]] did), there is no rivalry between both. 

Other rivalries exist with local clubs [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref name="wordpress.com" /&gt; Burnley have regularly played them in the league and cup competitions and the encounter between Burnley and Preston is, as of 2018–19, the most frequently played match in both club's histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Preston%20North%20End/|title=Burnley football club: record v Preston North End|last=|first=|date=|website=www.11v11.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Clarets'' also contested heated matches with [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the 1990s, when they were playing in the lower leagues, although feelings of animosity were mainly one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 February 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203154108/http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2004|dead-url=yes|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley will be the only club from the ceremonial county of [[Lancashire]] in the top flight during the [[2018–19 Burnley F.C. season|2018–19]] season, as they were in the previous two seasons. Their most local rivals will be West Yorkshire side [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], who are based 25 miles (40 kilometres) away from Turf Moor.
