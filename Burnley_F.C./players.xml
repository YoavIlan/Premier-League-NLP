'''Thomas David Heaton''' (born 15 April 1986) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

He began his professional career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] but was unable to break into the first team and spent time on loan with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], before joining Cardiff permanently after his release by Manchester United in July 2010. He then joined [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on a one-year deal with an option of a second year but turned it down in May 2013 in favour of a move to Burnley, whom he has represented in the Premier League, and captained for since 2015.

Formerly an international from under-16 to under-21 level, Heaton has been involved in senior [[England national football team|England]] squads since 2015, finally making his senior debut against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] on 27 May 2016 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] warm-up fixture.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Born in [[Chester]], Cheshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Heaton began his football career with [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], for whom he played both in goal and in midfield, but, after making 20 appearances for the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Under-17 team in the previous two seasons, he signed for United as a trainee on 8 July 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He became a regular in the Under-17 team during the 2002–03 season, and picked up an [[FA Youth Cup]] winner's medal despite playing second fiddle to [[Luke Steele (footballer)|Luke Steele]] throughout the entire competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He made his first appearance in the reserve team the following season, starting in a 3–1 home win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Premier Reserve League on 2 October 2003.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} At the end of the 2003–04 season, Heaton was named on the bench for the final of the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and won a winner's medal despite not taking the field.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By the 2004–05 season, Heaton had become the first-choice goalkeeper for the Manchester United reserve team, and was named on the bench for [[Stan Ternent]]'s testimonial on 17 August 2004, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Luke Steele after Steele had earlier come on for [[Tim Howard]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} With Heaton in goal for 17 of the 28 [[Premier Reserve League]] North matches and 12 of the 22 [[Central League (football)|Central League]] matches, the team went on to win both league titles by nine and five points respectively.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Heaton's form for the reserves resulted in him being loaned out to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] at the start of the [[2005–06 Swindon Town F.C. season|2005–06]], initially until 1 January 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} During his time at Swindon, he played over 20 matches, saving a penalty on his debut, and was described as "one for the future" by manager [[Iffy Onuora]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He returned to Manchester United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2006|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, after the recall of [[Ritchie Jones]] from [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], Heaton was sent there for the rest of the season after United rebuffed an approach from [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Heaton spent the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season|2007–08 season]] with the first team-squad at Manchester United, appearing on the bench when [[Edwin van der Sar]] was out due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2007|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cardiff City (loan)====
At the end of the 2007–08 season, Heaton agreed to move to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the duration of the [[2008–09 Cardiff City F.C. season|2008–09 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff sign Man Utd goalkeeper |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7407805.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2008 |accessdate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen as the club's first choice goalkeeper, above [[Peter Enckelman]], for the start of the season by manager [[Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)|Dave Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Phillips |title=Heaton wins Bluebirds keeper battle for Saints start |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/heaton-wins-bluebirds-keeper-battle-2157149 |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in every match until late November, with the exception of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] third round tie against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], when he was replaced by Enckelman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swansea 1–0 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7626773.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, late on in Cardiff's 2–1 away defeat to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on 22 November 2008, Heaton picked up an injury and was forced off.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The injury would go on to cost Heaton his place in the team as the club went unbeaten with Enckelman in goal for over two months.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In February, Enckelman was forced to undergo knee surgery which saw Heaton return in goal on 16 February 2009, when he picked up the [[man of the match]] award in a 4–0 defeat at the hands of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, he tore his thigh muscle during the match, ruling him out for up to five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff rocked by keeper injury |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7895288.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, Heaton found himself on the bench behind loanee [[Stuart Taylor (footballer, born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] but, following a 6–0 defeat against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], he replaced Taylor for the final three matches of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2008|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to keep Cardiff in the play-off places and he returned to Manchester United at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Terry (16 May 2009).

====Queens Park Rangers (loan)====
On 15 August 2009, Heaton was signed by [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on an emergency three-month loan deal, the terms of which allowed him to compete in the [[2009–10 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive: United keeper pens loan |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10373~1754286,00.html |publisher=Queens Park Rangers F.C. |date=15 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306033024/http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10373~1754286%2C00.html |archivedate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton's loan spell ended on 8 November 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He made one first-team appearance during his loan, in the 1–0 defeat at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the League Cup on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt;

====Rochdale (loan)====
After returning from QPR, Heaton joined [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] on 13 November 2009 until the end of December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heaton makes Dale switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_5692918,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 3–2 loss against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] on 14 November 2009.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; The loan was then extended until 23 January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeping Heaton on |url=http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10441~1917247,00.html |publisher=Rochdale A.F.C. |date=28 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723062351/http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10441~1917247%2C00.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; before a further extension pushed the end date back to 31 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeper extends loan |url=http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10441~1944299,00.html |publisher=Rochdale A.F.C. |date=25 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128102446/http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10441~1944299%2C00.html |archivedate=28 January 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 12 appearances for Rochdale, Heaton conceded only ten goals – including four clean sheets – and finished on the losing team just once.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt;

====Wycombe Wanderers (loan)====
Heaton spent less than two weeks back at Manchester United before going back out on loan to [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 12 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wycombe sign keeper Tom Heaton from Manchester United |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/8512842.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went straight into the Wycombe starting line-up for their away match against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] the following day, which they drew 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brentford 1–1 Wycombe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8494099.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton made his second appearance for the Chairboys in their 0–0 draw against Southampton on Tuesday 23 February 2010.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; He made a great save from a volley to keep the Chairboys on even terms with the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8497013.stm|title = Wycombe 0–0 Southampton|date = 23 February 2010|accessdate = 4 June 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Cardiff City===
[[File:Tom Heaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Heaton playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2011]]

Meeting with Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] on his future at the club amidst an expiring contract, Heaton declined an offer to stay at [[Old Trafford]], deciding instead to leave on free transfer in pursuit of regular playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/tom-heaton-burnley-england-alex-ferguson |title=Burnley's Tom Heaton: 'It got heated for a minute or two with Alex Ferguson' |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Hytner |date=19 August 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release by United, Heaton agreed a deal on 15 June 2010 to return to Cardiff City on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd goalkeeper Tom Heaton returns to Cardiff City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8742377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second debut in 4–1 win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] in the League Cup on 11 August.&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt; After first-choice goalkeeper [[David Marshall (footballer)|David Marshall]] suffered an elbow injury, Heaton established himself as Cardiff's new number starter.&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt; In late February, however, he suffered a groin injury, so [[Jason Brown (footballer)|Jason Brown]] and [[Stephen Bywater]] were brought in as cover on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn keeper Jason Brown completes Cardiff loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/9412224.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Heaton went into the team against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], where they won 4–1, their first win in four matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goalkeeper Tom Heaton fitness boost for Cardiff City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/9430040.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton's performances during the 2010–11 season earned him the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Morris |title=Player of the Year awards.

Under new manager, [[Malky Mackay]], Heaton found himself as cover for David Marshall, but he played a key part in the club's [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] run in which they reached the final thanks to two saves from Heaton in a semi-final [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He suffered an ankle injury just before the final, but he overcame the injury to start at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; Heaton followed his penalty heroics against Crystal Palace when he started the penalty shoot-out by pushing [[Steven Gerrard]]'s effort onto the bar, but he ultimately ended up on the losing team as Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–2.&lt;ref name=leaguecup2012&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Cardiff 2–2 Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17093419 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successful cup run, Heaton still found himself second string to Marshall and was released at the end of the season after rejecting a new contract in the Welsh capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Heaton, Lee Naylor and Paul Quinn leave Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18052140 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Heaton held talks with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] over a potential move; however, Watford's new owners decided to pull out of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hornets drop Heaton deal |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7870887/Hornets-drop-Heaton-deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Heaton went on trial with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] during their pre-season training camp in Spain and they opened contract talks soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City in Heaton talks |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7928823/ |publisher=Sky Sports |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, Heaton signed a one-year deal with the club, with the option for a further 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol City sign ex-Cardiff City goalkeeper Tom Heaton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19013441 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 18 August 2012, in a 1–0 defeat away to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221320 "Nott'm Forest 1–0 Bristol City"].

Heaton joined Burnley in May 2013, after turning down a further one-year deal at Bristol City.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} His decision was to stay in the Championship, and Burnley offered Heaton a two-year contract attaching him to the club until June 2015, with an option of a third year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22569957 |title=Burnley: Bristol City keeper Tom Heaton to join Clarets |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A target of manager [[Sean Dyche]] while at Watford, Dyche's first Burnley signing was described as a "good technician" with a "great pedigree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/dyche-delight-at-heaton-signing-170513-826442.aspx |title=Dyche delight at Heaton signing |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton immediately became first-choice goalkeeper for Burnley following the departures of [[Lee Grant (footballer, born 1983)|Lee Grant]] and [[Brian Jensen (footballer, born 1975)|Brian Jensen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He made his Burnley debut against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 3 August 2013.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} On 24 August, he was the recipient of a rare technical caution (his second of the match) for handling the ball after releasing it whilst playing against Brighton, a match they lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23736888 |title=Brighton 2–0 Burnley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton was a part of Burnley's defence that allowed only 37 goals, the fewest in the league, as Burnley returned to the [[Premier League]] for the first time since 2009–10.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Heaton also picked up 19 clean sheets, the most by any keeper in the regular season.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Playing career==

===Sheffield United===
[[File:Matt Lowton SUFC jrs1967 Owned Image.png|thumb|left|Lowton playing for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 2011]]

Lowton was born in [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; He joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] aged fifteen after a spell with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and progressed through [[Sheffield United F.C. Academy|Sheffield United's youth set up]] to reserve level, converting from a full-back to a central defensive role in the process.&lt;ref name="blades profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew Lowton&amp;nbsp;– Sheffield United Profile|publisher=Sheffield United F.C.|date=2 January 2008|url=http://origin-www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/AcademyProfiles/0,,10418~1080223,00.html|accessdate=14 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228194146/http://origin-www.sufc.co.uk/page/AcademyProfiles/0,,10418~1080223,00.html|archivedate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending a spell on [[loan (sports)|loan]] at [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield FC]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="blades debut"/&gt; in January 2009, Lowton went out on loan to Sheffield United's Hungarian sister club [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencváros]], along with fellow reserve player [[Sam Wedgbury]], to get first-team experience. He made his debut in the [[Hungarian Cup|Hungarian League Cup]] the next month,&lt;ref name="fradi debut"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kecskemet 0–0 Ferencvaros&amp;nbsp;– match report|url= http://origin-www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/FerencvarosDetail/0,,10418~1551671,00.html|publisher=Sheffield United F.C.|date= 10 February 2009|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making eighteen appearances before returning to United towards the end of the season.

Back in the Championship, Lowton found himself on the fringes of the first team and duly made his Blades debut in a 1–1 draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at the end of March 2010,&lt;ref name="blades debut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowton Makes Debut|publisher=Sheffield F.C.|date=25 March 2010|url=http://www.sheffieldfc.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=1383%3Alowton-makes-debut&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=60|accessdate= 25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming on as a late substitute, before making his full debut for the club in the final match of the season.

The following season, Lowton started Sheffield United's opening day fixture, away to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], but was issued with a straight red card. Despite this setback, he returned to the first-team picture and was rewarded with a new contract at the end of September.&lt;ref name="new contract"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lowton re-signs|url=http://origin-www.sufc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~2169121,00.html|publisher=Sheffield United F.C.|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001900/http://origin-www.sufc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~2169121,00.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowton continued a run of substitute appearances and rewarded United's faith by scoring his first senior goal in mid-October, netting in a 3–3 home draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="debut goal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheer elation for Matt|url=http://www.sheffieldunited-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/sheer_elation_for_matt_570468/index.shtml|publisher=Sheffield United Mad|date=17 October 2010|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowton played regularly for the remainder of the season, scoring four goals in all, but couldn't prevent the club from slipping to relegation.

With the Blades in [[Football League One|League One]] at the time, Lowton remained a key player and was rewarded with an extended contract in August 2011,&lt;ref name="new deal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lowton sets his sights on top-flight after signing deal|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-united/lowton_sets_his_sights_on_top_flight_after_signing_deal_1_3672601|publisher=The Sheffield Star|date=12 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making 55 appearances in total for the Blades during the following season and scoring six goals.&lt;ref name="last blades stats"&gt;{{Soccerbase season|53439|2011|name=Matthew Lowton|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===
Lowton completed a move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in July 2012 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £3&amp;nbsp;million, becoming [[Paul Lambert]]'s second signing as Villa manager,&lt;ref name="villa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lowton Signs for Aston Villa|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2169653/Matthew-Lowton-signs-Aston-Villa.html|work=Daily Mail|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut on 18 August 2012, in the [[Premier League]] against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="villa debut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19221467|title=West Ham 1–0 Aston Villa|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September, Lowton scored his first league goal for Villa in a 2–0 home win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref name="villa goal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19528067|title=Aston Villa 2–0 Swansea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2012|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2013, Lowton signed a new four-year deal to keep him at Aston Villa until the summer of 2017.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Burnley===

Tarkowski began his first season at Championship level as an ever-present in the Bees' league matches.&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt; He suffered a dip in form in September and early October, stepping up to take his first [[Penalty (association football)|penalty]] for the club in a league match versus [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 27 September and hammering the ball over the bar.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289510|title=Brentford 2–0 Leeds United|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was spared his blushes, with [[Jota (footballer)|Jota]] and [[Alan McCormack]] on target in the eventual 2–0 win.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Tarkowski gave away a penalty in a 2–1 defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 30 September and received his fourth [[Yellow card (association football)|yellow card]] of the season (his third in four matches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29320618|title=Watford 2–1 Brentford|author=Osborne, Chris|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another yellow card in a 0–0 draw with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 18 October saw him incur a suspension and he failed to appear again until 28 December,&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt; scoring what proved to be [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]' winner with an own goal in a 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30566334|title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–1 Brentford|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the blunder, Tarkowski held onto his starting place and scored his first goal of the season against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 25 April 2015, making sure of the points with the second in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/155226/james-tarkowski?season=2014|title=James Tarkowski|publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski had the opportunity to convert a late penalty to make it two goals in two games in the following match against Wigan Athletic, but his miss made little difference with the Bees already 3–0 ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32460049|title=Brentford 3–0 Wigan Athletic|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in both legs of Brentford's 5–1 [[2015 Football League play-offs#Championship|playoff semi-final]] aggregate defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and finished the [[2014–15 Brentford F.C. season|2014–15]] season with 38 appearances and one goal.&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt;

===Burnley===
[[File:James Tarkowski TomHeaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Tarkowski (centre) playing for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 2017]]

On 1 February 2016, Tarkowski signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Championship club Burnley for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Clarets Sign James Tarkowski |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/clarets-sign-james-tarkowski-2932970.aspx |publisher=Burnley FC |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski made his club debut on 20 February against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], entering as a substitute in the first half for [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]], who was forced off with a head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/14293941.Defender_James_Tarkowski_believes_there_s_more_to_come_from_Burnley_side/ |title=Defender James Tarkowski believes there's more to come from Burnley side |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Suzanne |last=Geldard |date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski deputised for Keane for the next two games, with Burnley victorious against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14339170.Clarets_defender_Keane_praises_Tarkowski__but_is_happy_to_be_back_in_the_side/ |title=Clarets defender Keane praises Tarkowski, but is happy to be back in the side |newspaper=News Shopper |first=Suzanne |last=Geldard |date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Keane was preferred by manager [[Sean Dyche]] at right [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]] upon his return to fitness as Tarkowski was limited to one substitution appearance the rest of the season. In third position in the table at the time of Tarkowski's signing, Burnley went unbeaten the rest of the season as they won their third ever second-tier title and direct promotion to the [[2016–17 Premier League|Premier League]] on their first attempt.

Tarkowski was handed the [[Captain (association football)|captain's armband]] for Burnley's 1–0 extra-time defeat to fourth-tier [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] in the [[2016–17 EFL Cup#Second round|EFL Cup]] on 24 August, after Dyche had made 10 changes to the team that upset Liverpool four days prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37103144 |title=Accrington Stanley 1–0 Burnley (AET) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski made his Premier League debut on 27 August at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], coming on as a substitute and receiving a booking for a foul in the run-up to Chelsea's final goal in the 3–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uptheclarets.com/no-answer-to-chelsea |title=No answer to Chelsea |website=UpTheClarets |first=Tony |last=Scholes |date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to crack the preferred centre-back partnership of Keane and [[Ben Mee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/15020080._It___s_not_been_easy____Burnley_defender_James_Tarkowski_admits_life_on_bench_can_be_tough/ |title='It's not been easy' – Burnley defender James Tarkowski admits life on bench can be tough |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski received scant playing time, despite being an ever-present on the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/april/tarkowski-no-loss-of-momentum/ |title=Tarkowski: No Loss Of Momentum |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a halftime substitution on 23 April 2017 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for Mee, who left with a shin injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/burnley/379/blog/post/3110996/burnley-fall-to-deserved-defeat-vs-man-united-as-joey-barton-struggles |title=Burnley fall to deserved defeat vs Man United as Joey Barton struggles |publisher=ESPN FC |first=Jamie |last=Smith |date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening the door for his first Premier League start on 29 April against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Tarkowski endured being hit by an object thrown by a Palace fan during celebrations of [[Ashley Barnes]]' opening goal, as well as keeping [[Christian Benteke]] in his back pocket en route to a clean sheet. Manager Dyche lauded his performance as "outstanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/15259045.Sean_Dyche_hails__outstanding__James_Tarkowski_as_battle_for_places_in_Burnley_side_hots_up/ |title=Sean Dyche hails 'outstanding' James Tarkowski as battle for places in Burnley side hots up |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/burnley/379/blog/post/3118567/james-tarkowski-capable-of-filling-the-void-left-by-michael-keane-at-burnley |title=James Tarkowski capable of filling the void left by Michael Keane at Burnley |publisher=ESPN FC |first=Jamie |last=Smith |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski would retain his place in the team for Burnley's final four fixtures, during which Burnley ensured their participation in the [[2017–18 Premier League|next edition]].

During the summer transfer window, teammate Michael Keane departed for Everton, allowing Tarkowski to line up with Mee in the center of Burnley's defense on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/burnley-not-planning-replace-michael-10992919 |title=Burnley not planning to replace Michael Keane – because they have a ready-made successor in the building |newspaper=Daily Mirror |first=David |last=Anderson |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/10935840/michael-keane-joins-everton-from-burnley |title=Michael Keane joins Everton from Burnley |publisher=Sky Sports |first=Dev |last=Trahan |date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned the shirt number 26 initially, Tarkowski assumed the number 5 shirt vacated by Keane ahead of the season. Tarkowski's performance against Crystal Palace on 10 September was deemed Man of the Match worthy by [[Sky Sports]], as Tarkowski held Benteke and Palace without a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/15529718.Sean_Dyche_backs_defensive_work_of_James_Tarkowski_as_he_cements_Burnley_place/ |title=Sean Dyche backs defensive work of James Tarkowski as he cements Burnley place |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 17 clearances in the match were the most by anyone in the Premier League that season, besting a mark previously held by himself in Burnley's surprise opening day victory over Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11708/11054419/is-defending-a-dying-art-burnleys-james-tarkowski-bucks-the-trend |title=Is defending a dying art?

==International career==
Tarkowski was eligible to play for Poland through his grandfather but preferred to play for England, stating "I've always seen myself as an English person so to play for Poland would be difficult,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/11298525/england-new-boy-james-tarkowski-admits-playing-for-poland-would-have-been-difficult|title=England new-boy James Tarkowski admits playing for Poland would have been 'difficult'|first=|last=|date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/football-notebook-burnley-star-holding-out-for-england-lgf9fkbjb |title=Football Notebook: Burnley star holding out for England |first=Matt |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-bee-good-enough-play-13738531|title=Former Bee good enough to play for England – and we get more money if he does – says Brentford owner|first=Tim|last=Street|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2018, he was named in the [[England national football team|England]] squad for pre-[[2018 FIFA World Cup]] friendlies against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England call-ups for uncapped quartet as Jack Wilshere earns recall |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43344416 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2018 |accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 27 March when starting in the 1–1 draw with Italy at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 1–1 Italy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43466395 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Thomas Mee''' (born 21 September 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

He has made over 200 appearances for them since then. He has also featured for the England youth teams from U19 to U21 level.

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
Mee was born in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], Greater Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|24539|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first came to prominence for Manchester City as the captain of the City [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy#Academy|Academy]] squad which won the 2008 [[FA Youth Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2297541/FA-Youth-Cup-Manchester-City-crush-Chelsea.html |title=FA Youth Cup: Manchester City crush Chelsea |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mee recalls Youth Cup win |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Academy-news/Archive/2009/March/Mee-recalls-Youth-Cup-win |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a two-year contract that would keep him at City until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mee signs new City contract |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Club-news/Archive/2009/February/Mee-signs-new-City-contract |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mee was given his first real test of first-team experience when he was taken on City's US tour in the summer of 2010, with club manager [[Roberto Mancini]] expressing that he wanted to blood his youth players and have a chance to see what they could do at a higher level than reserve fixtures. Mee made up two appearances, against [[Portland Timbers]] and [[New York Red Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Tour: Red Bulls 2–1 City |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/American-Pre-season-tour/2010/July/US-Tour-City-v-Red-Bull |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being given number 41 shirt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City squad numbers revealed |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/Archive/2010/July/Adebayor-snaps-up-No9-shirt |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901194615/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/Archive/2010/July/Adebayor-snaps-up-No9-shirt |archivedate=1 September 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mee followed up his tour appearances with a starting line-up appearance in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 22 September 2010 in a 2–1 away loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/9010120.stm |title=West Brom – Manchester City |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Mee making his debut, [[Javan Vidal]] and [[John Guidetti]] were given their first competitive appearances for the club in a match where three of the four players in the defensive line were young [[Manchester City F.C.

==Club career==
===Early career and Plymouth Argyle===
As a child, Barnes played on a team called Bath Arsenal, where his teammates included fellow future professional [[Scott Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; He began his senior career as a prolific goalscorer with local club [[Paulton Rovers F.C.|Paulton Rovers]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. He had an extended trial with Championship club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in March 2007, and sufficiently impressed to be awarded with an eighteen-month contract by the club, having scored several goals for the reserve team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paulton striker impresses Argyle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/6347653.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Plymouth debut in the first round of the [[2007–08 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in August 2007 against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], coming on as a substitute for first-team regular [[Sylvan Ebanks-Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plymouth 2–1 Wycombe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6941834.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently found first-team opportunities hard to come by, and was sent on loan to [[Football Conference|Conference]] side [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in November 2007 to gain some experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oxford sign deadline day strikers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oxford_utd/7107832.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes featured five times for Oxford United, including two [[FA Cup]] ties against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], before returning to Plymouth. He was sent out on loan again in March 2008 to another Conference club, this time to [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salisbury bring in Barnes on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/salisbury/7285607.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in five league matches for the club but did not find the back of the net.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===

Barnes subsequently joined [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 March 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/8587183.stm |title=Brighton make double loan signing |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/8587183.stm |archivedate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his debut against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] two days later, having been introduced as a substitute ten minutes earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 March 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8568156.stm |title=Brighton 3–0 Tranmere |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401054052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8568156.stm |archivedate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2010, Barnes signed a two-year contract with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion after transferring for an undisclosed fee from Plymouth Argyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~2086784,00.html |title=Barnes is back |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710184325/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~2086784%2C00.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2011, he scored the decisive goal in a 4–3 win at home against [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]], which confirmed their promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Paul |title=Brighton 4–3 Dag &amp; Red |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/12968187.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=11 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413033537/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/12968187.stm |archivedate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes finished the season as Brighton's second-top goalscorer behind [[Glenn Murray]], with 20 goals in 49 appearances.

In the [[2011-12 Football League Championship|2011–12 season]] Barnes remained a first-choice striker for Brighton's return to the Championship. He finished the season as Brighton's leading goalscorer with 14 goals in all competitions, 11 in the league.

On 9 March 2013, Barnes received a red card in stoppage time against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for attempting to trip up the referee. He was subsequently handed a seven-match suspension by [[the Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21804556 |title=Ashley Barnes: FA extends striker's ban to seven games |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans and manager [[Gus Poyet]] were critical of Barnes for this action as it left the club with only one senior striker available to play, as [[Craig Mackail-Smith]] and [[Will Hoskins]] were already injured for the rest of the season. On his return from the ban on 20 April, Barnes scored two goals in a 6–1 win over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and was named man of the match.

===Burnley===
On 10 January 2014, Barnes joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burnley sign Barnes from Brighton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25681552 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November, he scored the only goal at [[Turf Moor]] to defeat [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and gain Burnley's first win of the [[Premier League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abraham |first1=Timothy |title=Burnley 1–0 Hull |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29860234 |accessdate=8 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a second goal on 13 December, the sole goal in a home victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to take Burnley out of the relegation zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanghera |first1=Mandeep |title=Burnley 1–0 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30357668 |accessdate=14 December 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Barnes performed a high tackle on [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea's]] [[Nemanja Matić]], who was sent off for pushing him in retaliation. Barnes did not receive a booking for the challenge, and [[The FA]] confirmed that they would not take retrospective action as that was not normal procedure for attempted tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashley Barnes escapes FA disciplinary action over horror tackle on Nemanja Matic |url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/ashley-barnes-escapes-fa-disciplinary-action-over-horror-tackle-on-nemanja-matic-31014780.html |accessdate=24 February 2019 |work=Irish Independent |date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes was publicly criticised by Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], and said of the criticism "I found that hilarious".&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunter |first1=Andy |title=Ashley Barnes: ‘I got a text saying Mourinho had gone on TV to criticise me.

On 24 May 2015, as relegated Burnley finished the season with a win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], Barnes was taken off with knee cruciate ligament injuries, which would rule him out for the majority of [[2015–16 Football League Championship|the following campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashley Barnes: Burnley striker to miss most of next season |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32908544 |accessdate=28 May 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2018, he wrote himself into the history books, scoring his 16th goal in the Premier League to secure a 2–1 victory for Burnley against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. His 16th goal, and his 6th of the season, made him Burnley's leading scorer in the [[Premier League]] since it was formed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43178518 |title=Burnley 2–1 Everton |date=3 March 2018 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/33386/History/Ashley-Barnes |title=Ashley Barnes – History |website=www.whoscored.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes said in April 2015 that he had had no further contact with the [[Austrian Football Association]], and stated that he was open to representing either England or Austria at senior level if given the opportunity.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; In March 2017, whilst playing in the [[Premier League]] for Burnley, he expressed his desire to represent the [[Austria national football team|national senior side]].&lt;ref name="Austria"/&gt; His form in the 2017–18 season led to calls in Austria for him to receive a national team call-up, and manager [[Franco Foda]] confirmed in March 2018 that he was monitoring Barnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/austria/story/3403243/burnley-striker-ashley-barnes-being-monitored-by-austria-franco-foda |title=Austria coach monitoring Burnley's Barnes |date=2 March 2018 |website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Brady''' (born 14 January 1992) is an Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] and a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Brady began his career in the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United academy]]. However, after featuring just once for United's first team, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] initially on loan and then permanently in 2013. He made 124 appearances for the ''Tigers'', helping them reach the [[2014 FA Cup Final]]. In July 2015, he joined Norwich City for £7&amp;nbsp;million where he suffered relegation to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] with the club in 2016. He returned to the Premier League where he became Burnley's record signing in January 2017 when he completed a transfer for a fee reported to be around £13&amp;nbsp;million.

Brady has represented Ireland at all youth levels. After becoming their highest under-21 scorer of all time with seven goals, Brady made his senior international debut against [[Oman national football team|Oman]] in 2012, scoring and setting up two more goals in a 4–1 victory. He has earned over 30 caps for his country and represented them at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], scoring two goals during the tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Baldoyle]], Dublin, Brady attended [[Pobalscoil Neasáin]] and was part of their under-16 All-Ireland Championship winning team. He was spotted by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] scouts while playing for St. Kevin's Boys, and joined the club's academy shortly after his 16th birthday in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/who-robbie-brady-everything-you-8159139|title=Who is Robbie Brady?

In July 2008, Brady signed on as an academy scholar, and cemented his place in the under-18s throughout the following two seasons, as well as playing for the reserves. In the 2010–11 season, Brady graduated to the reserve team on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="goal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/slideshow/3712/1/the-five-best-young-irish-players|title=The five best young Irish players – Robbie Brady|publisher=Goal.com|date=28 May 2013|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as an unused substitute for the first team's [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] Fourth Round win at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 26 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/9059505.stm|title=Man Utd 3–2 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Jonathan|last=Stevenson|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his only appearance for Manchester United on 26 September 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for [[Alexander Büttner]] in a 2–1 victory over Newcastle United in the third round of the League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19645229|title=Man Utd 2–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Alistair|last=Magowan|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/brady-forced-to-bide-time-despite-making-competitive-united-debut-3242046.html|title=Brady forced to bide time despite making competitive United debut|work=Irish Independent|first=Daniel|last=McDonnell|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2011, Manchester United [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] Brady to Championship club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Jul/brady-joins-hull.aspx|title=Brady joins Tigers on loan|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|first=Adam|last=Marshall|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first match of the season on 5 August 2011 at the [[KCOM Stadium|KC Stadium]] in a 1–0 defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14337494|title=Hull 0–1 Blackpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal for the ''Tigers'' in a 1–0 win against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the KC Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~2434153,00.html |title=Tigers Net First Home Win |publisher=Hull City A.F.C. |date=27 August 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830122057/http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10338~2434153%2C00.html |archivedate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was extended until the end of the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12]] season on 5 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16431262|title=Manchester United's Robbie Brady to stay at Hull City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January, Brady scored in a 1–0 win against Reading at the [[Madejski Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16559464|title=Reading 0–1 Hull|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2012|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2012, Manchester United loaned Brady to Hull until 2 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Dec/michael-keane-and-jesse-lingard-rejoin-leicester.aspx|title=Reds trio extend loan deals|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|first=Adam|last=Marshall|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench the following day against Wolverhampton Wanderers as a replacement for [[Liam Rosenior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20134322|title=Hull City 2–1 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brady scored his first goal since returning to Hull on 8 December 2012 against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]; he scored with a 25-yard [[Direct free kick|free kick]] that went in off the crossbar, making it 2–0 to Hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20564877|title=Watford 1–2 Hull City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 December 2012|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady scored a first-half [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in Hull's opening home [[Premier League]] match on 24 August 2013, giving them a 1–0 win against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23736895|title=Hull 1–0 Norwich|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2013|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score two more goals in the Premier League the following month. He then underwent two separate groin operations which made him miss most of the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2575934/Robbie-Brady-injured-season-groin-operation.html|title=Hull midfielder Brady ruled out for the season after second groin operation|newspaper=Daily Mail|first=Colin|last=Young|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Patrick Hendrick''' (born 31 January 1992) is an Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Hendrick spent his early years with boyhood club St. Kevin's Boys in his native [[Dublin]]. He had a number of unsuccessful trials in England before joining [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s youth academy in 2008. Hendrick made his professional debut in April 2011 after impressive performances with the reserve team led manager [[Nigel Clough]] to include him in the senior setup. He quickly became a regular starter and appeared in the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final|2014 Championship play-off final]] where Derby missed out on promotion with a 1–0 loss to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Hendrick amassed a total of 214 appearances for Derby over seven seasons. He joined newly promoted Premier League side Burnley in August 2016, signing a three-year deal.

Hendrick has represented Ireland at all youth levels. Since his senior international debut in 2013, he has made over 40 appearances for Ireland and represented them at [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Derby County===
====Early years====
Hendrick joined Derby County as a youth player in 2008 from St Kevin's Boys in Dublin, having overcome [[Osgood-Schlatter disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/european-championships/hendrick-my-gaa-career-never-took-off-i-was-always-a-soccer-boy-31293997.html|title=Hendrick: My GAA career never took off, I was always a soccer boy|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|first=David|last=Kelly|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played regularly for the club's academy side before breaking into the reserve team during the 2009–10 campaign. He made [[2009–10 Derby County F.C. season#Player statistics|one start and seven substitute appearances]] as the club's reserve side successfully captured the [[The Central League#2008.E2.80.93present|2009–10 Central League Central Section title]]. At the end of the season his first involvement with the Derby County first team came on 2 May 2010 as he was an unused substitute in a 2–0 victory over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the final match of the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8644971.stm|title=Derby 2–0 Cardiff|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, on 8 July 2010, he signed his first professional contract, alongside four other Derby County academy graduates, including fellow Republic of Ireland Youth international [[Ryan Connolly]] and future [[League of Ireland]] player [[Graham Kelly (footballer, born 1991)|Graham Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2087069,00.html|title=Academy Five sign professional deals |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710134346/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2087069%2C00.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick played a more significant role in Derby's reserve side during the 2010–11 season, making [[2010–11 Derby County F.C. season#Player statistics|17 starts in all competitions and scoring 9 goals]], including a [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] in a 14–1 victory over [[Shirebrook Town F.C.|Shirebrook Town]] in the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/rams-rack-goals-cruise-victory-senior-cup-encounter/story-11604375-detail/story.html|title=Rams rack up the goals as they cruise to victory in Senior Cup encounter|newspaper=[[Derby Telegraph]]|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612171921/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-rack-goals-cruise-victory-Senior-Cup-encounter/story-11604375-detail/story.html|archivedate=12 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in a 5–0 win over [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]] in the final of the same competition.&lt;ref name="seniorcup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2343232,00.html|title=Rams lift the Senior Cup |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423011817/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2343232%2C00.html |archivedate=23 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the campaign, Hendrick impressed enough to earn a contract extension at Derby, which he signed in January 2011 to take him through until Summer 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/hendrick-and-connolly-agree-new-derby-deals|title=Hendrick and Connolly agree new Derby deals|publisher=[[Football Association of Ireland]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–2013====
Approaching the end of the 2010–11 campaign, Derby manager [[Nigel Clough]] stated his desire to give Hendrick a run in the first team, stating "(He's) progressed and done well this season...we would love to see him in the team for three or four games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/clough-keen-duo-chance-rams/story-11605160-detail/story.html|title=Nigel Clough is keen to give young duo a chance for Rams before season ends|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108193648/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Clough-keen-duo-chance-Rams/story-11605160-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick made his debut in the following match on 23 April 2011, as an 80th-minute replacement for [[Robbie Savage]] in a 4–2 home defeat to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~52424,00.html |title=Derby County 2 – 4 Burnley |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425233456/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10270~52424%2C00.html |archivedate=25 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2011–12 Derby County F.C. season|2011–12 season]], manager Nigel Clough stated that Hendrick would feature in the Derby County first team squad more often.&lt;ref name="11/12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/hendrick-future-knocks-door-rams/story-12905468-detail/story.html|title=Hendrick one for future as he knocks on door at Rams|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108190426/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Hendrick-future-knocks-door-Rams/story-12905468-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allocated the squad number of 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2396288,00.html |title=Squad Numbers Confirmed |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111707/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2396288%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite missing the majority of Derby's pre-season due to his call-up to the [[2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|European under-19 tournament]],&lt;ref name="11/12" /&gt; Hendrick was involved in first team duty from the start of the campaign, making substitute appearances in the season's opening two matches, against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He then claimed a place in the starting line-up from the third match (a 1–0 win at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]) onward. He scored his first professional goal in his fifth start of the season, claiming the winner in a 2–1 victory at [[Derby County F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|local rivals]] [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/14864055.stm|title=Nott'm Forest 1–2 Derby County|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 September 2011|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2456295,00.html |title=Hero Jeff named in Team of the Week |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924182056/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2456295%2C00.html |archivedate=24 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his rich vein of form followed into the next match, a 3–0 thumping of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], in which Hendrick grabbed his first goal at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] and secured a second consecutive Team of the Week place.&lt;ref name="millwallhometotw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2465381,00.html|title=Trio rewarded with Team of the Week spots|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=28 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820185118/http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2465381,00.html#|archive-date=20 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick's form saw him linked with switches to Premier League duo [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref name="premierlinks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/aston-villa-west-bromwich-albion-3314957|title=Derby midfielder a target for Prem clubs|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=8 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speculation saw Derby enter into contract talks with the midfielder over a new four-year deal.&lt;ref name="premierlinks" /&gt; However, his form tailed off badly (as did Derby's) over the subsequent six weeks, culminating in his substitution in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 19 November 2011, the first time in his young career he had been removed from a match early after being in the starting eleven, with Clough suggesting that the contract talks and Hendrick getting "[[Sports agent#Role|people]]" had had a negative effect on his game.&lt;ref name="peoplenow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/boss-blames-contract-talks-hendrick-dip-form/story-13909785-detail/story.html|title=Boss blames contract talks for Hendrick dip in form|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=29 July 2016}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the Dublin native signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract, extending his stay at the Pride Park club until the summer of 2015.&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2538477,00.html|title=Hendrick Pens New Rams Deal|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=10 December 2011|accessdate=12 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820175821/http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2538477,00.html#|archive-date=20 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick started the [[2012–13 Derby County F.C. season|2012–13 season]] in the starting eleven but after poor performances and scoring only once in his first 17 matches, he was dropped for [[Michael Jacobs (footballer)|Michael Jacobs]]. However, he regained his place shortly after due to an injury picked up by [[Craig Bryson]] after admitting his poor performances in mid-December.&lt;ref name="poorform"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20682693|title=Jeff Hendrick admits Derby County struggles|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 December 2012|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick's form improved&lt;ref name="poorform"/&gt; and he scored his second goal of the season in a 2–0 win at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 15 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/soccer/hendrick-strikes-for-derby-578006.html|title=Hendrick strikes for Derby|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|date=15 December 2012|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick started 2013 in good form, scoring three goals in the opening three matches,&lt;ref name="3goals2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/sport/soccer/jeff-ramming-trap-door-28965152.html|title=Jeff Ram-ming Trap door|newspaper=[[The Herald (Ireland)|The Herald]]|first=Aidan|last=Fitzmaurice|date=16 January 2013|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in a 3–1 home win which was later named Derby's ''Goal of the Season''.&lt;ref name="goaloftheseason13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/keogh-named-club-player-of-the-year-803602.aspx|title=Keogh Named Club Player of the Year|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=2 May 2013|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Derby teammate [[Kevin Kilbane]] stated that Hendrick had the ability to play in the Premier League.&lt;ref name="3goals2013"/&gt; He scored again on 9 February 2013, in a 2–2 draw against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21311544|title=Sheffield Wed 2–2 Derby|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 February 2013|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned further praise for his performance in Derby's 3–0 win at home to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 29 March, where he scored the opening goal.&lt;ref name="briscpraise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/garner-hails-hendrick-bryson-derby-county-beat/story-18563527-detail/story.html|title=Garner hails Hendrick and Bryson after Derby beat Bristol City|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|first=Steve|last=Nicholson|date=30 March 2013|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923230831/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Garner-hails-Hendrick-Bryson-Derby-County-beat/story-18563527-detail/story.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick finished the season runner-up for the Derby County Player of the Season Award and named the 58th best player in the [[2012–13 Football League Championship]] by the Actim Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/derbys-six-of-the-best-826899.aspx|title=Derby's Six of the Best|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick is known for being very hard-working, tactically aware and for his ability to pass the ball successfully.&lt;ref name="F365"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football365.com/news/forensically-watching-ordinary-player-jeff-hendrick|title=Forensically watching an ordinary player: Jeff Hendrick|publisher=Football365|first=Peter|last=Goldstein|date=30 March 2018|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is capable of playing as a central midfielder or an attacking midfielder behind the striker.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt; His big strength is winning second balls from aerial duels and keeping the attack going in advanced positions.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt; Owing to his lack of proficiency in scoring goals, Hendrick's most frequent task is recycling possession high up the pitch to create chances for his teammates.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt;

The [[2013–14 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2013–14 season]] saw Gibson become more involved in the first team squad for Middlesbrough; the team did not perform well, and manager [[Tony Mowbray]] was sacked in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024081843/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |archivedate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aitor Karanka]] replaced him, and they finished twelfth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3535212,00.html |title=Aitor Named Head Coach |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113125628/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3535212,00.html| archive-date=13 November 2013| dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014–15 Middlesbrough F.C. season|following season]] saw the club finish fourth, qualifying for the [[2015 Football League play-offs|promotion play-offs]]. They reached the final at [[Wembley Stadium]], having won 5–1 on aggregate against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], but were defeated 2–0 by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough 0–2 Norwich City – BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32776552 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2015–16 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2015–16 season]], Gibson helped Middlesbrough secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], having finished as runners-up, behind champions [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 1–1 Brighton: Boro promoted to Premier League – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-v-brighton-championship-promotion-decider-live-boro-albion |accessdate=29 August 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson still remained as a crucial part of Middlesbrough's squad in their [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17 Premier League campaign]], though they did not record positive results; they dropped into relegation zone in March 2017, with Karanka being sacked later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-city-vs-middlesbrough-live-12688922 |title=Stoke City 2–0 Middlesbrough RECAP: Desperately disappointing afternoon as Boro drop into relegation zone |publisher=Gazette Live |date=4 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017 |last=Shaw |first=Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39291081 |title=Aitor Karanka: Middlesbrough sack manager after three and a half years |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11680/10804567/middlesbrough-chairman-steve-gibson-says-tired-aitor-karanka-sacrificed-himself |title=Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson says tired Aitor Karanka 'sacrificed himself' |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=17 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relegation back down to the Championship was confirmed in May 2017, after a 3–0 defeat to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], with the club having only been in the English top flight for one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/39854503 |title=Bye Boro!

===Burnley===
Gibson signed for Premier League club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 5 August 2018 on a four-year contract for a joint club-record fee of £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45076206 |title=Ben Gibson: Burnley sign Middlesbrough centre-back for joint club record fee |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2018 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Gibson has competed for the [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17s]], the [[England national under-18 football team|under-18s]], the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] and the [[England national under-21 football team|under-21s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ben Gibson |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/G/Ben%20Gibson |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the under-17 teams that won the 2009 Nordic Cup, where he scored in the final against [[Scotland national under-17 football team|Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland U17s defeated in Nordic Cup final |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/scotland-u17s-defeated-in-nordic-cup-1032775#XXGOhvtxt1FVPhHg.97 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref name="Ben Gibson Middlesbrough"/&gt;

Gibson made his debut for England under-21s in the first leg of the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs]] against [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000413/match=2015235/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Under-21 2015 - History - England-Croatia – UEFA.com |first= |last=uefa.com |date=10 October 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the back of an impressive campaign for Middlesbrough. His performances made him a key member of the under-21 set up and he formed an effective partnership with [[John Stones]]. Gibson scored his first goal for the under-21s in England's final friendly before the European Championships against [[Belarus national under-21 football team|Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/under-21/2015/jun/belarus-report-110615 |title=Ben Gibson helps England secure Euro send-off victory |first=The Football |last=Association |website=www.thefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play 90 minutes in all of England's three group stage matches in the tournament although could not stop their disappointing early departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000408/match=2015368/index.html |title=Under-21 2015 - History - England-Portugal – UEFA.com |first= |last=uefa.com |date=18 June 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000408/match=2015374/index.html |title=Under-21 2015 - History - Sweden-England – UEFA.com |first= |last=uefa.com |date=21 June 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000408/match=2015378/index.html |title=Under-21 2015 - History - England-Italy – UEFA.com |first= |last=uefa.com |date=24 June 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson received his first call-up to the [[England national football team|English national team]] on 24 March 2017, replacing the injured [[Chris Smalling]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ben Gibson: Middlesbrough defender gets England call-up |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39382626 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was capped 42 times by the [[England national football team|England national team]] between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country in that time, and appearing at two World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/aug/01/peter-crouch-tottenham-expensive-english-striker|title=Are we addicted to Peter Crouch? |first=Barnay |last=Ronay |date=1 August 2009|accessdate=1 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch is one of 28 [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals]], holding the record for the most headed goals in [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41553916 |title=Peter Crouch: Stoke striker holds Premier League record for most headers |date=9 October 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch began his career as a trainee with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] and Swedish club [[IFK Hässleholm]] he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] acquired him on a transfer deal worth £1.5&amp;nbsp;million. He had a strong first season at [[Fratton Park]], and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in March 2002 for £5&amp;nbsp;million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2003 before making a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield]] in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]].

After scoring 42 goals in three seasons at [[Anfield]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] re-acquired Crouch for £11&amp;nbsp;million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international [[Jermain Defoe]]. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and [[Harry Redknapp]]. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] which earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010–11, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2011, for a club record fee of £10&amp;nbsp;million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's [[Stoke City F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] award. He scored eight in [[2012–13 Stoke City F.C. season|2012–13]] and then hit ten in both the [[2013–14 Stoke City F.C. season|2013–14]] and [[2014–15 Stoke City F.C. season|2014–15 seasons]]. Crouch spent seven-and-a-half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019.

==Early life==
Crouch was born in [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; but his family moved to Singapore when he was one year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Sam|title=Peter Crouch: The tall guy (and his dad) |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/peter-crouch-the-tall-guy-and-his-dad-396148.html |accessdate=4 August 2015 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 October 2007 |quote=Bruce and Jayne were 21 when Peter was born and within two years the young family moved to Singapore for Bruce's work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family's move to Singapore came about when his father Bruce, originally from [[Fulham]], took up a job offer to work at a Singaporean advertising agency.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; The Crouch family spent three years living in the Far East, and moved back to England after Bruce rejected the chance to work in Australia.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; They then spent time living at a [[YMCA]] in [[Tottenham]] before settling in [[Harrow on the Hill]]. Crouch attended Roxeth Primary and [[North Ealing Primary School|North Ealing Primary]] and began to play football with Northolt Hotspurs. He was then invited to join the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] Centre of Excellence in 1991 and he also played for the boys club West Middlesex Colts whilst attending [[Drayton Manor High School]].&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; Crouch turned down contract offers from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and instead joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the summer of 1994.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; He did not stay at QPR for long, however, for in November 1994, the coaching staff at [[Loftus Road]] moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], including its youth team manager [[Des Bulpin]], who offered Crouch a contract at Spurs.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt;

Crouch's family were Chelsea supporters and he became a [[ball boy]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17173591&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=62484&amp;headline=my-pete-s-no-freak-name_page.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212001904/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D17173591%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D62484%26headline%3Dmy-pete-s-no-freak-name_page.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |location=London |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=My Pete's No Freak |date=4 June 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he attended some Chelsea matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6541005.stm|title=Benitez expects test from Chelsea|publisher=BBC |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he told the Liverpool official website that despite this, he and his friends at the time were fans of QPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155602070413-1422.htm|title=Crouch: I Love it at Liverpool |first=Steve |last=Hunter |publisher=Liverpool F.C.|date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415045541/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155602070413-1422.htm |archivedate = 15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth team.&lt;ref name="England website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersC/BioCrouchP.html |title=Peter Crouch |work=England Football Online |publisher=Glen Isherwood &amp; Peter Young |date=24 May 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division and, in the summer of 2000, [[IFK Hässleholm]] in Sweden, where he played in the local fourth-highest division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1799614,00.html|title=Mellberg says Crouch is biggest threat|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Michael |last=Walker| date=17 June 2006|accessdate=18 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His move to Sweden came about when IFK Hässleholm sold [[Jon Jönsson]] to Tottenham for £70,000 and also agreed two loan deals for the Swedish club, that of Crouch and [[Alton Thelwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Crouch: Former Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke City man in Sweden |url=http://lesrosbifs.org/peter-crouch-former-tottenham-hotspur-and-stoke-city-man-in-sweden/ |work=Les Rosbifs |accessdate=7 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610070025/http://lesrosbifs.org/peter-crouch-former-tottenham-hotspur-and-stoke-city-man-in-sweden/ |archivedate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QPR and Portsmouth===
On 28 July 2000, Tottenham sold Crouch to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Queens Park Rangers for £60,000.&lt;ref name="England website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Francis grabs Grieves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/863684.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=2 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an immediate impression with QPR, scoring ten league goals in the [[2000–01 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2000–01 season]], but it was not enough to prevent the team's relegation to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huddersfield 2–1 QPR|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1285987.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] bought Crouch for £1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portsmouth sign £1.5m Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1421884.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=4 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch scored 18 [[2001–02 Football League|league]] goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth during the [[2001–02 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001–02 season]] and was tipped by manager [[Graham Rix]] to have a big future in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch tipped for the top|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1650237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=11 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===
In March 2002, [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] made a successful £5&amp;nbsp;million bid for Crouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch seals Villa move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1894063.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=27 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his home debut for Villa, the equalising goal against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and went on to score twice in seven appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle held by Villa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1901022.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=2 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch, however, failed to hold down a regular place in the Aston Villa team in the following [[2002–03 Aston Villa F.C. season|2002–03 season]] making 18 appearances without scoring.&lt;ref name=sb0203/&gt; Looking for first team football, he was loaned to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] from September to December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canaries sign Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/3080160.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch played 15 times for the Canaries in [[2003–04 Norwich City F.C. season|2003–04]], scoring four goals helping the team gain promotion.&lt;ref name=sb0304/&gt; Crouch was sent off for retaliation during Norwich's 3–1 win at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], but nonetheless his spell at Norwich renewed interest in his abilities from other clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch eyes Canaries stay|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/3253998.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the three-month loan, he returned to Aston Villa, and scored a brace against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], a late winner at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and the opener at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name=sb0304/&gt; Villa sold Crouch in July 2004 to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for a fee of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch joins Saints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/3876589.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
Despite initially being back-up to first choice strikers [[James Beattie (footballer)|James Beattie]] and [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]], Crouch became the main attacking focus of the Southampton team upon the arrival of [[Harry Redknapp]] and the sale of Beattie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beattie to complete £6.5m Everton switch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2353206/Beattie-to-complete-6.5m-Everton-switch.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=30 May 2017|date=3 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored many key goals in Southampton's relegation battle, including memorable goals against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a 2–0 home win, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a 1–1 home draw and two away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middlesbrough 1–3 Southampton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4343227.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and [[South Coast derby|Saints' arch-rival]] Portsmouth out of the [[2004–05 FA Cup|FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 2–1 Portsmouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4197721.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=29 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first [[England national football team|England]] call-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup Scouting – Peter Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4750849.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the [[2004–05 Southampton F.C. season|2004–05 season]], his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 1–2 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4525113.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7&amp;nbsp;million to Liverpool on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch completes Liverpool move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4677639.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
[[File:Peter Crouch 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Crouch with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2006]]

Crouch underwent intense media scrutiny because of a goal drought during his first months at Liverpool. For 19 matches—the span of four months—he was unable to score. Crouch was praised for other facets of his game, such as his touch on the ball, but his first goal for the club evaded him. The fact that Crouch possessed "good touch for a big man" became something of a media [[cliché]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,1588933,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Barry|last=Glendenning|title=The Crouch-a-saurus|date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=4 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his Liverpool career, the supporters composed a new chant: "He's big, he's red, his feet stick out the bed, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The long and the short of it|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2042066,00.html|first=Simon|last=Garfield |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drought finally ended on 3 December 2005 when he scored against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Although this first goal was originally given as an [[own goal]], it was later awarded to Crouch on appeal; he went on to score a second goal in the same match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4473084.stm|title=Liverpool 3–0 Wigan |date=3 December 2005 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these goals, Crouch had played over 24 hours of football for Liverpool without scoring. In addition to this, he also had to deal with unpleasant taunts from crowds at matches, as he had throughout his footballing career, who often chanted "[[freak]]" at him due to his unusual height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1782536,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London | first=Daniel| last=Taylor| title=Crouch rises above the jibes to feel at home among the elite|date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score several goals that season, including the only goal in the fifth round of the [[FA Cup]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], Liverpool's first victory over them in the FA Cup post-Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4720494.stm|title=Liverpool 1–0 Man Utd |date=18 February 2006 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, he helped Liverpool to win the [[2006 FA Cup Final]] against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], providing an assist for [[Steven Gerrard]] to score the second Liverpool goal.&lt;ref name=2006FAC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4756045.stm |title=Liverpool 3–3 West Ham (aet) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Crouch.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Crouch warming up for Liverpool in 2007]]

Three months later, in the curtain-raiser to the [[2006–07 Liverpool F.C. season|2006–07 season]], he headed the winning goal for Liverpool in the club's 2–1 victory over Chelsea in the [[FA Community Shield]].&lt;ref name=2006FACS&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4780739.stm |title=Chelsea 1–2 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League]] campaign, he scored his first goals in European club competition against [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maccabi H 1–1 Liverpool (agg 2–3)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5266050.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch sustained a [[nasal fracture|broken nose]] when playing against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6394923.stm|title=Liverpool star Crouch breaks nose|publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2007|accessdate=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he played in some subsequent matches, on 9 March 2007, it was announced that he would undergo surgery on the injury that would keep him out of football for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Broken nose for Crouch|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/2406576/broken-nose-for-crouch|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March, he returned to action after the operation and scored the first [[hat-trick]] of his club career, coming against Arsenal in a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6491075.stm|title=Liverpool 4–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 March 2007|accessdate=31 March 2007|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also a so-called "[[Hat-trick#Association football|perfect hat-trick]]," consisting of goals scored from his right foot, left foot and head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.setanta.com/portal/article/motorsports?open&amp;articleid=4295990dcaecea6b802572ae005ec839 |title=Crouch hat-trick sees off poor Arsenal|publisher=Setanta Sports|date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=31 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155156/http://au.setanta.com/portal/article/motorsports?open&amp;articleid=4295990dcaecea6b802572ae005ec839 |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later participated in the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]], coming on as a substitute for [[Javier Mascherano]] as Liverpool were defeated by [[A.C.

At the start of the [[2007–08 Liverpool F.C. season|2007–08 season]], he had restricted opportunities to play for Liverpool due to the arrival of other strikers, including [[Fernando Torres]], but nonetheless scored against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] in a [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualifying win in August, his eighth goal in his past ten appearances in that competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,2158021,00.html|title=Frustrated Crouch helps Liverpool cruise through|first=Andy|last=Hunter|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 August 2007|accessdate=1 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then also scoring the first and last goals of an 8–0 win over [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] in the first round of the Champions League in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7076592.stm|title= Liverpool 8–0 Besiktas |date=6 November 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 July 2009|first=Mandeep|last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December, Crouch was sent off in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, receiving a straight red card for a foul on Chelsea's [[John Obi Mikel]] as Liverpool exited the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanghera|first=Mandeep|title=Chelsea 2–0 Liverpool|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7145789.stm|accessdate=30 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he scored a vital goal in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, helping Liverpool secure fourth spot ahead of [[Merseyside derby|local rivals]] [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenal 1–1 Liverpool|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7320164.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Portsmouth===

After his displays in England's friendlies, Crouch partnered with [[Michael Owen]] in attack for England's opening 2006 World Cup match against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 10 June 2006. England won the match 1–0 and Crouch kept his place in the starting line-up for the following match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], against whom he scored his first competitive international goal. The goal provoked some controversy as replays showed Crouch to be pulling on [[Brent Sancho]]'s long hair, holding the defender down, to gain an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/football.cfm?id=888922006|newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |title=Sancho angry as TV shows Crouch pulled hair to climb |first=Colin |last=Stewart |date=17 June 2006 |accessdate=17 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch was rested for England's third group match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] as Rooney returned from injury to join the starting line-up.

===Euro 2008 qualifying===
Crouch remained a part of the England set-up under Eriksson's successor as manager, [[Steve McClaren]], and started McClaren's first match in charge, a friendly against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in August 2006. He scored twice in England's 4–0 victory. Two further goals followed in England's next match, a 5–0 win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in their opening qualifying match for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] on 2 September 2006.

Crouch was named in Capello's final 23-man squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and was given the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 2010: England announce squad numbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8720235.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as a substitute for [[Emile Heskey]] in England's opening match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and also came off the bench for [[Gareth Barry]] in the following match against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 1–1 USA|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_05|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 0–0 Algeria|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_23|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch did not take part in the final group stage match with Slovenia or the 4–1 loss to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs England|last-16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia 0–1 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_37|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 4–1 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_51|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-2010 World Cup===
Crouch came on as a substitute in the home friendly against France for the injured Steven Gerrard on 17 November 2010. He scored quickly from an [[Ashley Young]] corner to make the score 1–2 with an angled side-footed volley. It was his second touch of the ball.&lt;ref name=France/&gt; After not making an appearance for England for almost a year, Crouch stated in October 2011 that he "does not carry much hope" of receiving a call-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stoke City's Peter Crouch fears for England future|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15275354.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 October 2011|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a run of good form in September 2017, Crouch said in a television interview that he was not officially retired from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafez|first1=Shamoon|title=Premier League stats: Harry Kane, Man Utd, Man City, Arsene Wenger, Roy Hodgson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41456051|accessdate=2 October 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality as a footballer==
===Nicknames===
Although generally known as "Crouchy," other nicknames he has been given by fans and the media in England have included "RoboCrouch"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcup.itv.com/News/Story_Page/0,15843,8607_1277794,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029235019/http://worldcup.itv.com/News/Story_Page/0%2C15843%2C8607_1277794%2C00.html |archivedate=29 October 2006 |title=RoboCrouch out of operation? |publisher=ITV |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Crouchinho" (an ironic use of the "-[[inho]]" suffix, meaning "little" in Portuguese and used by many Brazilian footballers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/columnists/story/0,,1881581,00.html|title=Crouch on the couch |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been also referred to as "[[Mr. Roboto]]" by [[Univision]]'s commentators and as "Pantera Rosa" ("[[The Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]]") by [[Fox Sports en Español]] commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/Nick_Webster/2006/09/03/Pantera_RosaEnglands_not_so_secret_weapon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415175323/http://community.foxsports.com/Nick_Webster/blog/2006/09/03/Pantera_RosaEnglands_not_so_secret_weapon|archivedate=15 April 2012|title='Pantera Rosa'...

===Robotic dancing===
In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing [[goal celebration]].&lt;ref name="Robot"/&gt; A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate [[David Beckham]]'s house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May. He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper wrote that the dance was inspired by the lyrics to the [[Arctic Monkeys]]' hit single "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17164877&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=one-bets-one-looks-good-on-the-dancefloor--name_page.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509143121/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D17164877%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D115875%26headline%3Done-bets-one-looks-good-on-the-dancefloor--name_page.html |archivedate= 9 May 2011 |first1=Martin |last1=Lipton |first2=Paul |last2=Byrne |title=World Cup Willie |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=2 June 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, Crouch announced he would perform his robotic dance again only if England were to win the World Cup, saying, "It's not about robotic dancing. It is about scoring goals and winning matches. It's an important time for everyone now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5072314.stm|title=Crouch halts robotic celebrations|publisher=BBC |date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=13 June 2006|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, he was quoted in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper as saying that, "It was funny at the time, but I didn't want to carry on doing it until it became unfunny. I've stopped doing it for the time being, but if I ever score a really big goal you never know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1863698,00.html|title=Confident Crouch happy to be plan B |first=Paul |last=Wilson |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=3 September 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2007, Crouch said he would never use the robot dance again unless he scored in the UEFA Champions League Final, but he partially reprised it on 1 April 2009 after scoring during England's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine after a Comic Relief sketch.&lt;ref name="Robot"&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/5094114/Peter-Crouchs-robot-dance-and-the-10-funniest-goal-celebrations.html |title=Peter Crouch's robot dance and the 10 funniest goal celebrations|last=Wilson|first=Steve|date=2 April 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2017, Crouch gave the dance a final outing to celebrate his 100th Premier League goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38835628|title=Peter Crouch: Stoke striker 'emotional' to reach 100-goal Premier League milestone |date=2 February 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Steven Arnold Defour''' (born 15 April 1988) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

In his senior career he played for [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]], [[Standard Liège]], [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and Burnley, winning nine honours with the second and third teams combined.

Defour earned his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 2006, and represented the nation in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Racing Genk===
Born in [[Mechelen]], Defour played youth football with local [[KV Mechelen]], moving to [[K.R.C. Genk]] in 2004 due to the club's financial difficulties. He made his [[Belgian Pro League|Pro League]] debut during the [[2004–05 Belgian First Division|2004–05 season]] and, at just 17, became first-choice, finishing the [[2005–06 Belgian First Division|2005–06 campaign]] with 26 games and one goal to help his team to the fifth position.

When Genk failed to qualify for [[UEFA|European competition]], Defour tried to move to [[AFC Ajax]] in the summer of 2006. Genk, enraged by earlier reports that the Dutch team had approached the player to broker a deal without their consent, did not accept the proposed transfer fee and after protracted negotiations Ajax pulled out of the deal. Defour tried to force a transfer by threatening to leave, using a Belgian law that allowed professional athletes on fixed-term contracts to leave their employers before the end of the stipulated term, but Ajax did not express a renewed interest in his services and he ended up signing for [[Standard Liège]] for a much-reduced transfer fee, effectively breaking a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between Belgian sides not to sign under-contract players using the aforementioned law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/cnt/gi8rr5fv|title=Defour 'slachtoffer' van 33 jaar oude vete|trans-title=Defour 'victim' of 33-year-old feud|newspaper=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|language=Dutch|date=5 May 2006|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/transfer-defour-naar-ajax-van-de-baan.htm|title=Transfer Defour naar Ajax van de baan|trans-title=Defour's transfer to Ajax not happening|publisher=[[Voetbal International]]|language=Dutch|date=7 June 2006|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/steven-defour-verbreekt-contract-bij-genk.aspx?artikel=cc86655b-7696-4656-8654-9124b6ad9238|title=Steven Defour verbreekt contract bij Genk|trans-title=Steven Defour breaks contract with Genk|newspaper=[[Het Belang van Limburg]]|language=Dutch|date=16 June 2006|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Liège===
Defour joined Standard on a five-year deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voetbalbelgie.be/nl/article.php?id=4766|title=Standard neemt Steven Defour over|trans-title=Standard signs Steven Defour|publisher=Voetbal België|language=Dutch|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being appointed [[Captain (association football)|team captain]] at the start of [[2007–08 Belgian First Division|his second year]] after taking over from Portugal's [[Sérgio Conceição]] – he was just 19 years old. He received the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] at the end of the season in the process, leading the ''Reds'' to their first league title in 25 years.

In late 2009, shortly after scoring four goals in 31 games to help Standard [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|renew its domestic supremacy]], Defour broke his right foot. During his period of recovery he received a letter from [[Alex Ferguson]], manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], wishing him all the best in his recovery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=836270&amp;sec=transfers&amp;cc=4716 Defour ready to make next step]; [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]], 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and this led to persistent rumours of a switch to the English club, but he refuted these by saying "I do know that Manchester United are monitoring me – if everything goes well and I continue playing as I am, there is a better chance of me leaving than there was at the start of the season";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/transfer-rumours/2079/5/defour-ready-make-manchester-united-move Defour ready to make Manchester United move]; [[Talksport]], 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, nothing came of it.

On 18 September 2012, Defour netted Porto's second goal against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb]], in [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|the season]]'s [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage (2–0 away win).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000347/match=2009496/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Porto extend Dinamo losing streak|publisher=UEFA|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March of the following year, for the same competition but in the [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]], he was [[Penalty card#Yellow card|booked]] twice and subsequently [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] in the 49th minute of the second leg of the tie at [[Málaga CF]], as the [[Porto|northerners]] lost 0–2 at [[La Rosaleda Stadium]] and 1–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000348/match=2009593/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Santa Cruz sends Málaga into last eight|publisher=UEFA|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anderlecht===
On 13 August 2014, Defour signed a five-year deal with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]], for €6&amp;nbsp;million. On 25 January of the following year, when playing at Standard Liège, he was sent off for deliberately kicking the ball at home fans who had unfurled a banner depicting his severed head under the slogan "Red or Dead". His ejection caused the visiting supporters to rip out their seats and throw them onto the pitch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/25/anderlecht-steven-defour-standard-liege-banner|title=Anderlecht's Steven Defour sees red over Standard Liège fans' banner|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the banner received criticism from both the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] and the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30975769|title=Standard Liege: Steven Defour sent off after fans' horror banner|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Ronald Walters''' (born 20 September 1983) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Walters started his career at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] but failed to break into the first team and joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Again he failed to establish himself and went out on loan to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] before joining Hull permanently. He then went on to play for [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] and [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] before finally finding regular football at [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. Walters spent three years at [[Portman Road]] before joining [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for £2.75 million in August 2010. He helped Stoke reach the [[2011 FA Cup Final]] after scoring twice in the semi-final against Bolton Wanderers as Stoke won 5–0. Walters played 54 matches during the [[2011–12 Stoke City F.C. season|2011–12]] season and then played in [[UEFA Euro 2012]] with the Republic of Ireland. Walters remained a regular at Stoke under [[Tony Pulis]] and [[Mark Hughes]], scoring 62 goals in 271 appearances before joining Burnley in July 2017.

Walters scored five times for the Republic of Ireland in 2015 during their successful [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, and was acknowledged with that year's FAI Senior International Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/we-were-written-off-in-the-qualifiers-and-im-sure-it-will-be-the-same-at-the-euros-jon-walters-scoops-international-player-of-the-year-award-34557004.html|title='We were written off in the qualifiers and I’m sure it will be the same at the Euros' – Jon Walters scoops international Player of the Year award|date=20 March 2016|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==
=== Blackburn Rovers ===
Walters was born in [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]], Merseyside&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|20442|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started his career at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] having been spotted by playing for Shaftesbury under 16s in the Eastham &amp; District Junior League by Rovers' scout for Wirral and Wales, Mike O'Brien who moved quickly to sign him.

{{Quote|"He was at Shaftesbury under-16s when I first decided he had something. I had been watching him for the previous two years but his physique wasn't what it should be. But once he got to 16 you could see him developing. He was always quick. He played against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and scored three for Merseyside Schools, so I made the decision to bring him in and he scored two against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the Saturday and we signed him on the Monday. If a player is a bit special you need to make a quick decision. And it paid off because the gaffer ([[Graeme Souness]]) thinks a lot of him. But I'll never predict what he can do or if he is close to making the first team. All I will say is the lad is scoring goals for the reserves and if he continues to do that he's got a chance."|Blackburn Rovers scout Mike O'Brien on why he signed 16-year-old Jonathan Walters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wirral's footballing Rovers; Exclusive report: Youngsters from Peninsula snapped up by Blackburn's youth Academy to train as stars of future.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wirral's+footballing+Rovers%3b+Exclusive+report%3a+Youngsters+from...-a080334344|work=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He played for Blackburn's youth and reserve teams where he scored prolifically, helping the club reach the [[FA Youth Cup]] final in 2001, losing 6–3 on aggregate to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seconds for young Guns; Blackburn 3 Arsenal 1 (Agg: 3–6).|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3a+Seconds+for+young+Guns%3b+Blackburn+3+Arsenal+1+(Agg%3a+3-6).-a074910692|work=The Mirror|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his promising career with Rovers was ended due to a 'serious breach of club discipline' which was described as 'totally out of character' and saw him suspended by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackburn suspend Irish star in new club scandal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+Blackburn+suspend+Irish+star+in+new+club+scandal.-a084286468|work=The People|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played in four Premier League games for Bolton making his professional debut as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], before signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on loan in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2858585.stm|title=Hull keep Walters|accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport | date=21 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his debut for Hull Walters scored twice in a 5–1 win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2789929.stm|title=Carlisle 1–5 Hull |accessdate=31 October 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his loan spell at Hull, Walters returned to Bolton, where he again went out on loan, this time to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.crewealex.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10414~409455,00.html |title=Walters keen to show what he can do |accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=crewealex.net }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however he failed to make an appearance for Crewe due to a tooth infection. In the [[2003–04 Barnsley F.C. season|2003–04 season]] he joined [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on loan and played eight league games for the "Tykes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3264815.stm|title=Walters joins Tykes |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Joseph John Hart''' (born 19 April 1987) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Burnley}} club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]]. With over 100 Premier League clean sheets, Hart holds the joint record for the most [[Premier League Golden Glove]] awards (four) and has amassed 75 international caps since his debut in 2008.

He began his career at his hometown club [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the [[Football Conference]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]]. In 2006, he moved to top-flight Manchester City, having attracted the attention of several Premier League teams. He spent time on loan at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in his first season, before spending the 2009–10 season at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Hart was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] and was voted as the [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)#Premier League|Premier League goalkeeper of the 2009–10 season]] in recognition of his performances at Birmingham. He returned to Manchester City for the 2010–11 season and won the Golden Glove for keeping the most [[clean sheets]] throughout the Premier League season. Hart replicated this feat in the 2011–12 season and was a key player during City's [[2011–12 Premier League|title-winning campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2012/May/Hart-QPR-preview |title=Hart wins Golden Glove award for Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– Manchester City FC |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Golden Glove for the third year in a row in the [[2012–13 Premier League|following season]], and earned a second Premier League title in 2014. In 2015, Hart once again won the Golden Glove award for the fourth time in five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/may/250515-sergio-aguero-and-joe-hart-seal-golden-awards-double-for-manchester-city.html |title=Aguero and Hart seal Golden Awards double for Man City |publisher=Premier League |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526024954/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/may/250515-sergio-aguero-and-joe-hart-seal-golden-awards-double-for-manchester-city.html |archivedate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of [[Pep Guardiola]] in 2016, Hart was dropped for selection by the new manager and made only one appearance in the Champions League before moving on loan to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in successive seasons. He then signed a permanent transfer to Burnley after having being told he had no first team future with City.
 
A former regular for England at [[England national under-21 football team|Under-21 level]], Hart made his senior international debut in June 2008, and was recognised as England's first-choice goalkeeper from 2010 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City keeper Joe Hart could be England's most capped player ever, says David James |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/8511486/Manchester-City-keeper-Joe-Hart-could-be-Englands-most-capped-player-ever-says-David-James.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has gained over 70 caps and was selected in England's squads for two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and as many [[UEFA European Championship]]s.

==Early life==
Hart was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, to Charles Hart, who sold gym equipment, and his wife Louise, a nursery school teacher.&lt;ref name=Telegraphbio&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/9792712/Manchester-City-and-England-in-safe-hands-with-Joe-Hart-between-the-posts.html |title=Manchester City and England in safe hands with Joe Hart between the posts |first=Mark |last=Bailey |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Oxon Primary School, followed by [[Meole Brace School]] in Shrewsbury, where he was [[Head Boy]] in his final year.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Hart 'would love' to play for Manchester City again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/28/joe-hart-birmingham-manchester-city |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 August 2009 |location=London |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a schoolboy, he was an equally competent [[cricket]]er and briefly played for [[Shrewsbury Cricket Club|Shrewsbury CC]] in the [[Birmingham and District Premier League]] and also spent two years in [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]'s youth squads, playing alongside [[England national cricket team|England]] cricketer [[Steven Davies]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

While still a 15-year-old schoolboy, Hart travelled with the [[first-team]] squad of his hometown club, [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 1 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/exeter-city-v-shrewsbury-town-01-february-2003-15331 |title=Exeter City v Shrewsbury Town, 01 February 2003 |work=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=1 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a non-playing substitute on that occasion and fulfilled that role again versus [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] at [[Gay Meadow]] on 1 March 2003, still some six weeks short of his 16th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/shrewsbury-town-v-rochdale-01-march-2003-15545 |title=Shrewsbury Town v Rochdale, 01 March 2003 |work=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match yielded Shrewsbury's final victory in a season that culminated in relegation to the [[Football Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shrewsburytown-mad.co.uk/results_fixtures/2002_2003/shrewsbury_town/index.shtml |title=Shrewsbury Town's results from season 2002/2003 |work=Shrewsbury Town Mad |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the one season that Shrewsbury spent in the Conference, Hart made his senior debut on 20 April 2004, a day after his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name=debut&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14440757 |title=Goalkeeper Joe Hart signs new 5-year deal at Man City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the full 90 minutes in the match against [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend &amp; Northfleet]].&lt;ref name="Joe Hart debut"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/shrewsbury-town-fc/2016/04/20/on-this-day-joe-hart-debuts-for-shrewsbury-town/shrewsbury-town-v-gravesend-northfleet-20-4-04-debutant-goalkeeper-joe-hart |title=On this day: Joe Hart debuts at Shrewsbury |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=20 April 2016 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he conceded three at [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/morecambe-vs-shrewsbury/48559 |title=Morecambe 3–3 Shrewsbury Town |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=24 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart did not play again until April of the following year, as [[Scott Howie]] dominated goalkeeping duties. With Shrewsbury back in [[the Football League]] (the newly renamed [[EFL League Two|League Two]]) and struggling, Hart played six matches, conceding four goals.&lt;ref name=Telegraph130111/&gt;

From the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], Hart made the step up into the first team, and became the club's first-choice goalkeeper.

===Manchester City===
Hart's move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] was completed as soon as Hart returned from England under-19 duty in Belgium, where a defeat to [[Serbia national under-19 football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] in the [[UEFA U-19 Championship 2006 (Elite Round)|elite round]] meant England failed to qualify for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/archived/mens-u19s/news/2006/u19s_vserbiamontenegro |title=England fail to qualify |publisher=The Football Association |date=22 May 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time that City were to pay an initial £600,000 fee for Hart, rising to £1.5&amp;nbsp;million if undisclosed clauses were achieved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goalkeeper Hart to join Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/5006544.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 May 2006 |date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but John Wardle, then City chairman, revealed in 2012 that the transfer fee was actually £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Why Manchester City fans have former Blues chief to thank for the signing of hero Joe Hart |last=Spencer |first=Peter |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/why-manchester-city-fans-have-former-blues-799798 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=6 October 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was recommended to City hierarchy by the club's goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers who believed he had great potential.&lt;ref name="Joe Hart debut"/&gt; Hart made his debut for City on 14 October 2006 after injuries ruled out [[Andreas Isaksson]] and [[Nicky Weaver]] for the [[Premier League]] match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref name="Hart Man City profile"/&gt; He kept a [[Shutout|clean sheet]] in the match, which finished goalless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Stuart |title=Easy for Warnock to make point |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/15/match.manchestercity |accessdate=12 August 2014 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart made his first international appearance in September 2005 in an [[England national under-19 football team|England under-19]] friendly match against [[Belgium national under-19 football team|Belgium]] at [[The Darlington Arena|Darlington]]; replacing starting goalkeeper Ben Alnwick at half-time, he was unable to save the penalty that made the score 3–2, but with three minutes left made a "terrific one on one save" from an unmarked attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~709746,00.html |title=England under 19's claim 3–2 win over Belgium |first=Garry |last=Mann |publisher=Darlington F.C. |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=4 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625035212/http://www.darlington-fc.net.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~709746,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFO19/&gt; He played in five more matches for the under-19s, his last a 1–0 defeat away to Serbia and Montenegro on 22 May 2006.&lt;ref name=EFO19&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/MatchRslTmU19pg1.html |title=England's matches: The under-19s 1991–2010 |work=England Football Online |publisher=Chris Goodwin, Glen Isherwood &amp; Peter Young |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAProfile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/all-teams/players/h/joe-hart |title=Joe Hart |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior team===
[[File:Joe Hart 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Hart playing for [[England national football team|England]] at [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]

Having been a regular in the England under-21 squad, Hart was called up by [[Fabio Capello]] to the senior England team for the friendly matches against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and Trinidad and Tobago. An unused substitute against the United States, he made his debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008 at the [[Hasely Crawford Stadium]], [[Port of Spain]]. He came on at half time for [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]] with England 2–0 up, eventually running out 3–0 winners.&lt;ref name="Hart England debut"/&gt; However, Hart's senior England debut did not earn Shrewsbury Town the expected bonus of £500,000 from Manchester City, as negotiated as part of his transfer in 2006, because it was not a competitive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Town in Wait For Extra Hart Money |newspaper=Shropshire Star |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2008/07/01/town-in-wait-for-extra-hart-money/ |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart kept his place in the squad for a friendly against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in August, but remained unused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/17/englandfootballteam |title=Capello names Heskey in favour of Young, Crouch and Bent |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=17 August 2008 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Blackburn Rovers goalkeeper [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] withdrew from the squad for [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group 6|World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in October 2009, Hart took his place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/hart-and-cahill-receive-england-call-1798499.html |title=Hart and Cahill receive England call |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November, he was called up for a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darren Bent called up to England squad for friendly against Brazil |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/08/darren-bent-england-brazil |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 November 2009 |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not appear in either match.&lt;ref name=englandstats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englandstats.com/players.php?pid=1156 |title=Charles Joseph Hart |work=Englandstats.com |publisher=Davey Naylor |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart did not feature in the World Cup but started England's next match, a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], to earn his fourth cap.&lt;ref name=englandstats/&gt; He conceded his first England goal in dubious circumstances when the ball appeared not to have crossed the line from a deflection from [[Phil Jagielka]], and made a vital late save from [[Zoltán Gera]] as England won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8902576.stm |title=England 2–1 Hungary |first=Paul |last=Gerrard |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was given his first competitive cap in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier, a 4–0 win against Bulgaria at [[Wembley Stadium]]; he made three crucial saves, one of which he palmed away to begin the counterattack that led to an England goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/defoe-hat-trick-helps-batter-bulgaria |title=Defoe hat-trick helps batter Bulgaria |magazine=FourFourTwo |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won another two caps November 2011 in friendlies against world champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in each case keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 England victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15693231.stm |title=International friendly: England 1–0 Spain |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15709627.stm |title=International friendly: England 1–0 Sweden |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2013, Hart saved a penalty kick and the subsequent follow-up shot from [[Ronaldinho]] in a friendly match against Brazil at Wembley Stadium.

'''Anders Rozenkrantz Lindegaard''' ({{IPA-da|ɑnɐs ˈlenəɡɒːˀ|lang}}; born 13 April 1984) is a Danish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He began his career with his hometown club, [[Odense Boldklub]], but a lack of first-team opportunities led to a move to Norwegian club [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]] in 2009, with whom he won the [[Norwegian Football Cup]]. After winning the Goalkeeper of the Year award in both Denmark and Norway in 2010, Lindegaard was signed by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he played for five years as a back-up to [[Edwin van der Sar]] and [[David de Gea]]. He moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 2015, but was unable to break into the team and joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in January 2016, initially on loan. He joined Burnley in September 2017.

Lindegaard represented Denmark at [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] level before making his [[Denmark national football team|senior]] debut on 7 September 2010 against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. He went on to win 5 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for his country.

On 16 May, Lindegaard played in the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] final for the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United Reserves]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C. Reserves and Academy|Bolton Wanderers Reserves]], which United went on to win 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First Team: Anders Lindegaard |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Anders-Lindegaard.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |accessdate=16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
On 14 September, Lindegaard made his first [[UEFA Champions League]] start for United against Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with Lindegaard winning critical acclaim for his performance. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, still decided to continue with first-choice keeper [[David de Gea]] for the next match in the Premier League against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Asked about challenging for the first-team spot, Lindegaard said, "What answer do you expect to that question? I've said a thousand times before I'm not here to pick my nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ferguson-snaps-over-stupid-query-about-de-gea-omission-2354958.html |title=Ferguson snaps over 'stupid' query about De Gea omission |first=Ian |last=Herbert |date=15 September 2011 |work=Independent.co.uk |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, Lindegaard was handed his second Champions League start for United. He played against [[FC Oțelul Galați|Oțelul Galați]], with the match ending in a 2–0 win for United, earning them their first Champions League Group stage victory.

On 1 October 2011, Lindegaard made his Premier League debut for United against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in a 2–0 win at Old Trafford. He continued his run of clean sheets in his next four appearances in the Premier League, which included a 1–0 home win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 5 November, a 1–0 away win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 3 December, a 5–0 away win at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 21 December and a 5–0 home win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in United's Boxing day fixture. His run of clean sheets in the league finally ended on 4 January away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] when he was beaten three times in a game that United lost 3–0. A week later, on 8 January, Lindegaard played his biggest game for Manchester United so far, a 3–2 win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the FA Cup. He was chosen again for the starting line-up the following week when United beat [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/nu-er-lindegaard-nummer-1 |title=Nu er Lindegaard nummer 1 |first=Michael |last=Qureshi |date=14 January 2012 |work=Sporten.dk |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2012, he damaged ankle ligaments in training, forcing him to miss the game against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the next day, along with the unwell first-choice David de Gea, meaning youngster [[Ben Amos]] played goal. Later in the week, Sir Alex Ferguson revealed Lindegaard would miss the next four-to-five weeks and would not be expected back until the home game with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

On 3 August 2012, Lindegaard signed a new four-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United's Anders Lindegaard signs new four-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19109604 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took the number 13 jersey made vacant by the departure of [[Park Ji-sung]], who had left the club for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Reds reveal shirt numbers |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Aug/manchester-united-squad-numbers-for-2012-2013-season.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=17 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Since the match against Norwich on 17 November 2012, first-choice goalkeeper David de Gea was sidelined with wisdom teeth problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=McDonnell |title=Hottest tin roof: Spanish cat De Gea says there's no pressure like United pressure |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-goalkeeper-david-de-1461004 |work=mirror.co.uk |publisher=Mirror Online |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindegaard was kept in goal for United's next five games until De Gea was recalled for the Champions League match against [[CFR Cluj]]. Lindegaard returned to the first team on 1 December 2012, against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in a match which ended 4–3. After the match, he came in for criticism by former United goalkeeper [[Alex Stepney]], who said that he lacks "authority at the back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Sir Alex Ferguson needs to figure out that two into one won't go |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/08/sir-alex-ferguson-manchester-united |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian Online |date=8 December 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period on the bench as an understudy to De Gea, and with United having already secured the Premier League title a month earlier, Lindegaard started in goal for Sir Alex Ferguson's final game as United manager against West Brom at [[The Hawthorns]]; the match finished 5–5. That appearance was Lindegaard's tenth of the season, thus qualifying him to receive a Premier League winner's medal.

====2013–14 season====
In [[2013–14 Manchester United F.C. season|2013–14]], Lindegaard made just three appearances for the Manchester United first team – against Norwich in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in the FA Cup and Newcastle in the Premier League– keeping clean sheets against Norwich and Newcastle.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 31 August 2015, Lindegaard joined West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lindegaard signs for Albion |url=http://www.wba.co.uk/news/article/wba-albion-lindegaard-manchester-united-2659187.aspx |website=wba.co.uk |publisher=West Bromwich Albion FC |date=30 August 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preston North End===
On 23 January 2016, Lindegaard joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on loan for the remainder of the [[2015–16 Preston North End F.C. season|2015–16 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anders Lindegaard Signs For The Season From West Bromwich Albion |url=http://www.pnefc.net/news/article/anders-lindegaard-signs-for-the-season-from-west-bromwich-albion-2916966.aspx?platform=hootsuite |publisher=Preston North End F.C. |date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 2 February where he kept a clean sheet against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35406635|title=Derby County 0–0 Preston North End|date=2 February 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted Man of the Match on his home debut, against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35447308|title=Preston North End 2–1 Huddersfield Town|date=6 February 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2016, Lindegaard signed a one-year permanent deal with Preston North End after the mutual termination of his West Brom contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anders Lindegaard Completes Permanent Move To Deepdale |url=http://www.pnefc.net/news/article/2016-17/anders-lindegaard-in-permanent-move-to-preston-north-end-3165250.aspx|publisher=Preston North End F.C. |date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnley===
On 21 September 2017, Lindegaard joined [[Premier League]] side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on a free transfer. He made his Burnley debut as a substitute for the injured [[Nick Pope (footballer)|Nick Pope]] during the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] second qualifying round on 26 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44938522|title=Aberdeen 1–1 Burnley|publisher=BBC SPort|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lindegaard has represented Denmark at [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[Denmark national football team|senior]] level. He made his debut for the U-19s in September 2002, and played a [[2003 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]] qualification 1–0 win over [[Switzerland national under-19 football team|Switzerland]] on 13 October 2002.&lt;ref name="UEFA" /&gt; He played a total six youth international games until September 2003.

Lindegaard made his senior international debut in a [[UEFA Euro 2012]] qualifier against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 7 September 2010, which Denmark won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=830052&amp;sec=transfers&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;cc=4716 |title=Man Utd eye Lindegaard as Van der Sar successor |date=4 October 2010 |work=ESPN soccernet |accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season=2012/round=15171/match=2002304/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Last-gasp Kahlenberg crushes Iceland |first=Peter |last=Bruun |date=7 September 2010 |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October 2010, Denmark faced [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in another Euro 2012 qualifier. Early on in the game, with Denmark trailing 2–0, an injury sustained by starting goalkeeper [[Thomas Sørensen]] brought Lindegaard into action. He made many saves to keep his team in the game, but conceded a goal in the 85th minute to [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] with the match finishing 3–1 in Portugal's favour. Lindegaard started the following Euro 2012 qualifier against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], in which he kept a [[clean sheet]] as Denmark won 2–0. He was expected to feature for Denmark at the Euro 2012 finals but due to injuries while playing for his club and lack of proper game time post-recovery, his national teammate [[Stephan Andersen]] took over after normal second-choice goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen was injured in a pre-tournament friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

===LGBT activism===
Lindegaard is one of the few footballers to have spoken out against the intolerance of [[Homosexuality in association football|homosexuality in football]] and the absence of openly gay players from the professional game. In a 2012 blog entry, he wrote, {{quote|As a footballer I think first and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/football-needs-gay-hero-says-manchester-united-goalkeeper-575849.html|title=Football needs gay hero, says Manchester United goalkeeper|publisher=Breaking News|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Stephen Thomas Ward''' (19 October 1912 – 3 August 1963) was an English [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 [[Profumo affair]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] political scandal which brought about the resignation of [[John Profumo]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], and contributed to the defeat of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government a year later.

In 1945 Ward began practising [[osteopathy]] in London, and rapidly became successful and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time he also studied at the [[Slade School]], and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Among these was [[William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor|Lord Astor]], at whose country house, [[Cliveden]], in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, [[Christine Keeler]]. Profumo, who was married to the actress [[Valerie Hobson]], embarked on a brief affair with Keeler, most of their assignations taking place in Ward's home in Wimpole Mews.

Ward's friendship with the Russian military attaché [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]], known by [[MI5]] to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended the relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], but a few weeks later admitted his affair. He resigned his ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership of the [[Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom|Privy Council]]. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963 he was charged with immorality offences and committed to trial.

In the trial that followed, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off immoral earnings. However, before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014 the trial verdict was put under review by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Lemsford]], [[Hertfordshire]], Stephen Ward was the second son of Arthur Evelyn Ward, Vicar of Lemsford, and Eileen Esmée, daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors. The Ward family had a military and clerical background;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemsfordchurch.org.uk/PMpdfs/Parish%20Mag%20Feb%20March%202018%20no%20ads.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Vigors family were of distinguished Anglo-Irish stock. The explorer [[Wilfred Thesiger]] was a cousin- his father, Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger, son of [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford]], married Eileen's elder sister, Kathleen.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Thesiger: The Life of the Great Explorer, Alexander Maitland, Harper Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen's siblings were John (b. 1911), Raymond (b. 1916), and twins Bridget and Eileen (b. 1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemsfordchurch.org.uk/PMpdfs/Parish%20Mag%20Feb%20March%202018%20no%20ads.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the family moved to Twickenham, where Arthur Ward served as vicar of Holy Trinity Church, then in 1922 to [[Torquay]] in [[Devon]], when he became Vicar of St. Matthias.&lt;ref&gt;Crockford's Clerical Directory, Oxford University Press, 1930, pg 1355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= odnbW&gt;{{cite web|last= Davenport-Hines|first= Richard|title= Ward, Stephen Thomas|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40839|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|accessdate= 31 January 2014}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Ward later became a Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and, in 1934, a Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ward: Scapegoat, Douglas Thompson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secrets and Lies, Christine Keeler, Douglas Thompson, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Ward was educated at [[Canford School]], in the village of [[Canford Magna]] (near the [[market town]] of [[Wimborne Minster]]) in [[Dorset]], as a boarder, where he was punished for an assault on a fellow-pupil after refusing to name the real culprit. This experience left a longstanding mark. Somewhat lazy and a regular underachiever, he had few realistic career choices when he left Canford in 1929. In his early twenties, he studied at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery, now known as the [[A.T. Still University|A.T. Still University of Health Sciences (ATSU)]] in [[Missouri]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Missouri&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ward moved to London, where he worked for a few months as a carpet salesman in Houndsditch before an uncle found him a job in [[Hamburg]] as a translator in the German branch of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Dorril, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, he left the Hamburg job for Paris and registered for a course at the [[Sorbonne]], while eking out a living as a tour guide. He returned briefly to Torquay in 1932 before moving again to London where he worked as a tea salesman. 

In 1934, he was persuaded by his mother to seek qualification as an [[osteopath]], by studying at the [[A. T. Still University|Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery]] in [[Missouri]], USA.&lt;ref name=Missouri/&gt; He spent four years there, completing a demanding course that qualified him as a general medical practitioner in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; Ward was greatly impressed by the United States. He later commented: "I loved America and Americans, a warm-hearted, open and dynamic people. Their kindness and hospitality made me feel ashamed of the standoffish way the British treat people."&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Second World War===
On his return from the United States, Ward set up as an osteopath in [[Torquay]]. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, he volunteered for service in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC) but was rejected because his American qualifications were not recognised. In 1941, he was conscripted as a [[private (rank)|private]] into the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], based at [[Bovington]]. His osteopathic skills became known; and, for much of his time at Bovington, he was relieved from general duties and permitted to practise his profession. This arrangement offended the RAMC; and, after an inquiry, Ward's activities were stopped. However, in view of his evident talents, he was recommended for a commission in the RAMC within the new category of "stretcher-bearer".&lt;ref name= KK16&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1943, he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the non-medical section of the RAMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36107|date=23 July 1943 |page=3376 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1944, Ward was posted to India. The army still found it difficult to accommodate him; and he spent much time canvassing for the proper recognition of osteopathy, while being officially assigned to non-medical duties. However, he found opportunities to practise his skills; among those whom he treated was [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who impressed Ward: "Although much of his policy was opposed to that of my own country. I knew that when I was with him I was in the presence of greatness, and my encounter with him was certainly the most important meeting of my life".&lt;ref name= KK16/&gt; Following a nervous collapse that led to a period in a psychiatric hospital, Ward returned to England in October 1945 and was discharged from the army "on grounds of disability".&lt;ref name= KK16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Dorril, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society osteopath===
After the Second World War, Ward worked for the Osteopathic Association Clinic in Dorset Square, London. While there he had opportunities to treat well-known public figures, the first of whom was the American ambassador, [[W. Averell Harriman]]. Later he treated [[Duncan Sandys]], the son-in-law of [[Winston Churchill]]; Sandys recommended Ward to Churchill himself. Ward now had sufficient status and recommendations to set up his own private practice, in [[Cavendish Square]] just off [[Harley Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon attracted a clientele from the worlds of politics, society and show business, and his social life became absorbed into this milieu; Ward's polished manners and conversational skills assured him of social success. He befriended the cartoonist and socialite [[Arthur Ferrier]], whose parties he attended regularly and where he mixed with, among others, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece]], later the Duke of Edinburgh but then a junior officer in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; His own parties were noted for their social mix: "a barrister, a barrow-boy, a writer, a motor salesman, a peer, and always, for some reason, a steady stream of pretty girls".&lt;ref name= KK27&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but his libido was low and his relationships were often platonic.&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; His preference was for the type he called "alley-cats" – city girls that he could impress and dominate.&lt;ref name= DH99&gt;Davenport-Hines, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He generally enjoyed discussing and watching sexual activity rather than participating,&lt;ref name= KK27/&gt; a factor which may have contributed to the failure of his marriage, on 27 July 1949, to an actress, Patricia Mary Baines, who came from a prosperous middle-class background.&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt;&lt;ref name= DH99/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s Ward's practice grew. Among his new patients was [[William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor|Lord Astor]] who  became a close friend and who helped Ward to cement his place in London society. In return, Ward introduced the shy Astor to his own world of night-clubs, parties and girls.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, for a nominal rent, Astor gave Ward the use of a riverside cottage in his grounds of the Astor family estate at [[Cliveden]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Many of Ward's assorted friends from all walks of life joined him for weekends at the cottage, where from time to time they would be joined by Astor and his guests from the main house. Sometimes Ward and his party would mingle with the gatherings at the main house.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his spare time Ward had attended art classes at the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade school]],&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; and subsequently he developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 he was commissioned by ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the Royal family, among them [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward hoped to visit the [[Soviet Union]] to draw portraits of Soviet leaders; to help him, one of his patients, the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' editor [[Colin Coote|Sir Colin Coote]], arranged an introduction to [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]], listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; British Intelligence ([[MI5]]) knew from the Soviet double-agent [[Oleg Penkovsky]] that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Russian [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]].&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, and sometimes joined Ward's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.&lt;ref name= Denning8&gt;Denning, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

MI5 considered Ivanov a possible defector, and sought Ward's help to this end, allocating him to a case officer known as "Woods".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Dorril, pp. 24 and 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a [[Track II diplomacy|backchannel]], through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 105–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profumo affair==
{{main|Profumo affair}}

In 1959 Ward met [[Christine Keeler]], a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, [[Soho]]. Captivated by his charm, she agreed to move in with him, although their relationship was not sexual. She stayed with him, on and off, for the next several years, and often spent time at the riverside cottage. During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests at the cottage with Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Irving et al, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; At the main house, among a large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts, was [[John Profumo]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], and his wife, the actress [[Valerie Hobson]]. 

On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward introduced Keeler to Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her,&lt;ref&gt;Profumo, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; and promised to be in touch. Ward later reported to MI5 that Profumo and Ivanov had met, and that Profumo had shown considerable interest in Keeler. This information was an unwelcome complication in MI5's plans to use her in a honeytrap operation against Ivanov, that might secure his defection.&lt;ref name= Knightley87/&gt;

Keeler and Profumo embarked on a brief affair; some suggest that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961.&lt;ref name= Knightley87/&gt;&lt;ref name= DH250&gt;Davenport-Hines, pp. 250–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= P165&gt;Profumo, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple usually met at Ward's house in Wimpole Mews; Profumo did not pay Keeler for her services, apart from a few small presents and once, a sum of £20 as a gift for her mother.&lt;ref name= DH250/&gt; On 9 August 1961 Profumo was warned by [[Norman Brook, 1st Baron Normanbrook|Sir Norman Brook]], the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]],&lt;ref name= P165/&gt;  of the dangers of mixing with Ward's group, since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward's dependability.&lt;ref name= DH250/&gt; That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning "Darling...", cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association;&lt;ref name= Knightley87&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 86–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeler insists that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, p. 89; Keeler, pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Press and public remained largely ignorant of the Keeler-Profumo liaison until early in 1963, when Keeler became a focus of newspaper attention as the "missing witness" in a case involving one of her former lovers, [[Johnny Edgecombe]]. At that point Keeler began talking indiscriminately, and attempted to sell her story to newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, pp. 258–263.&lt;/ref&gt; None at this stage dared print it, but rumours of the affair were widespread, and there was much speculation. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: "Mr James Montesi", "Miss Gaye Funloving", "Dr Spook" and "Vladimir Bolokhov". 

In a statement to the House of Commons on 22 March 1963, Profumo denied any impropriety with Keeler.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward, who knew the truth, at first supported Profumo;&lt;ref&gt;Irving, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; however, when  he found himself the target of an aggressive police investigation, and facing immorality charges, he revealed his knowledge to Profumo's political masters and to the press.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, pp. 282–288&lt;/ref&gt; Profumo found the burden of sustaining his lie too much, confessed his guilt and resigned from government and parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the resignation, amid growing rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, Ward was arrested and charged with several counts of living off immoral earnings and of procuring.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and death==
Ward's committal proceedings began on 28 June, at Marylebone magistrates' court, where the Crown's evidence was fully reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 55–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was committed for trial at the [[Old Bailey]], but was released on bail pending trial.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Dorril, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; In his account of the trial, which began on 22 July, Richard Davenport-Hines describes it as an act of political revenge: "The exorcism of scandal in high places required the façade of [Ward's] conviction on vice charges".&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; While living with Ward, Keeler and her fellow-model [[Mandy Rice-Davies]] had made small contributions to household expenses, and had repaid money lent to them by Ward. The thrust of the prosecution's case, in which Keeler and Rice-Davies were their principal witnesses, was that these payments indicated that Ward was living off their immoral earnings. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution's case looked weak; however, Ward's perceived image had been heavily tarnished in the committal proceeding. None of his well-known friends offered to speak on his behalf, and MI5 did not reveal the uses they had made of Ward as a channel of communication to the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecuting counsel, [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]], portrayed Ward as representing "the very depths of lechery and depravity",&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; while the judge, [[Archibald Pellow Marshall|Sir Archie Marshall]], adopted a similarly hostile attitude. 

Ward was represented by [[James Burge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/27/mandy-rice-davies-quotation-no-correction&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the trial, information relating to another case, in which Keeler had been a leading witness, was revealed by the [[Court of Appeal]]. This indicated that Keeler's evidence in that earlier case had been false. Marshall did not reveal the salient fact to the Ward trial jury that the reliability of the prosecution's chief witness had been compromised, and effectively invited the jury to disregard the appeal court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 92–95 and 101.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July Marshall began his summing-up, in a speech that was so damning that Ward despaired. That evening, after writing numerous letters to friends and to the authorities, Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day Marshall completed his summing-up; the jury found Ward guilty ''in absentia'' on the charges of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and Rice-Davies, while acquitting him of several other counts. Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 243–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August, a coroner's jury ruled Ward's death a suicide by [[barbiturate]] poisoning. According to reports, Ward left several notes, one of which read, "I'm sorry to disappoint the vulture [...] I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19630804&amp;id=JxUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1JsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2962,801052|title=Ward Leaves Suicide Note Saying He's Sorry to Disappoint Vultures|date=4 August 1963|newspaper =Reading Eagle|page= 1|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the inquest, after a private memorial service at the chapel in St Stephen's Hospital, Ward's remains were cremated at [[Mortlake Crematorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In their accounts of the security aspects of the Profumo affair, Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril provide extra information concerning Ward's last hours, his movements and his visitors. They also quote from an interview with "a former MI6 operative", who asserted that Ward had been murdered by an agent working on behalf of MI6. The main motive for the killing was Ward's continuing ability to embarrass the government and the Royal family. The method, apparently, was to encourage Ward to continue to take barbiturates until a fatal dose had been ingested. The reporter [[Tom Mangold]], one of the last to see Ward alive, dismisses the murder theory, while allowing that there are unexplained circumstances relating to Ward's death.&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Dorril, pp. 316–323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Tweedie|first= Neil|title= The Profumo Affair: 'It was decided that Stephen Ward had to die’|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10488686/The-Profumo-Affair-It-was-decided-that-Stephen-Ward-had-to-die.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date= 2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The government appointed [[Lord Denning]], the [[Master of the Rolls]], to investigate the various rumours that had emanated from and around the Profumo affair. Denning's report, published on 26 September 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Denning Report (the Profumo Scandal), 26 September 1963|url= http://www.publicinquiries.org/inquiries/1963-1979/the_denning_report_the_profumo_scandal|publisher= PublicInquiries.org|accessdate= 23 January 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140123015737/http://www.publicinquiries.org/inquiries/1963-1979/the_denning_report_the_profumo_scandal|archivedate= 23 January 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that there had been no security leaks,&lt;ref&gt;Denning, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, pp. 107–110.&lt;/ref&gt; He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an "utterly immoral" man whose diplomatic activities were "misconceived and misdirected".&lt;ref&gt;Denning, pp. 7 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Profumo affair had damaged [[Harold Macmillan]]'s government; Macmillan resigned as prime minister in October 1963, citing health reasons. His successor was [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]], who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|October 1964 general election]] the Conservative government was narrowly defeated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and [[Harold Wilson]] became prime minister.&lt;ref name= KK257&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward's role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982, when the ''Sunday Times'' located his former contact, "Woods".&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Kennedy, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeler, in one of several accounts of her life, has denounced Ward as a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside [[Kim Philby|Philby]], [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]], but without direct supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, pp. 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators share Davenport-Hines's view that Ward was a scapegoat and that his trial was an "historical injustice".&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; The human rights lawyer [[Geoffrey Robertson]] has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up. Above all, the judge failed to disclose Keeler's perjury at an earlier trial, which made her a tainted witness.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, pp. 125–157.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 the case came under consideration by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], but in 2017 the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, one factor being the unavailability of a full transcript of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Quinn|first= Ben|title= Rice-Davies challenges minister on Profumo case|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 10 February 2014|date= 18 January 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/17/mandy-rice-davies-profumo-stephen-ward-trial|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Ruth|title=Case of Profumo affair's 'pimp' will not go to court of appeal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/09/case-of-profumo-affairs-pimp-will-not-go-to-court-of-appeal|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Guardian online|date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1989 film version of the Profumo affair, ''[[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]'', Ward is played by [[John Hurt]].&lt;ref name= odnbW/&gt; Ward was portrayed by [[Alexander Hanson (actor)|Alexander Hanson]] in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Stephen Ward the Musical]]'', which opened in the West End at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on 19 December 2013 and closed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/profumo-musical-set-for-west-end-29379638.html | title=Profumo musical set for West End | work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] | date=28 June 2013 | accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geoffrey Robertson, the script of the musical is "remarkably faithful to the facts".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aaron Justin Lennon''' (born 16 April 1987) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

He began his career at hometown club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], making his first-team debut in 2003 and becoming the youngest player to play in the Premier League at that time. In 2005, he moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for £1&amp;nbsp;million, where he made 364 appearances across all competitions and scored 30 goals. In 2008, Lennon won his first major honour, the Football League Cup, as Tottenham emerged victorious with a [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2–1 win]] over London rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. In September 2015, he joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for £4.5&amp;nbsp;million, after his successful spell with the club on [[Loan (sports)|loan]].

Lennon made his senior debut for the [[England national football team|English national team]] in 2006, and has been selected by England for two World Cups.

==Early life==
Born in [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Lennon has one older brother and a younger sister and brother and is of Irish and Jamaican heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/180771/Robert-Green-plays-golf-and-finds-a-ball-game-he-can-get-to-grips-with |title=Robert Green plays golf and finds a ball game he can get to grips with |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |first=David |last=Pilditch |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="englandplayers.netprofile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandplayers.net/football/aaronlennon/index.html |title=England Players Profiles – Aaron Lennon |publisher=EnglandPlayers.net |accessdate=26 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115235/http://www.englandplayers.net/football/aaronlennon/index.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended City of Leeds High School, but then attended [[Boston Spa School]] due to the fact that the school was closer to [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]] so it was easier for him to focus on both GCSEs and his football career.&lt;ref name="englandplayers.netprofile" /&gt; He was first spotted by scouts when he was eight years old; his older brother Anthony played for Manchester United's youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-391043/Englands-silent-hero.html |title=England's silent hero |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |first=James |last=Mills |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
In 2001, Lennon joined the [[Leeds United F.C. Reserves and Youth Team|Leeds United Academy]].&lt;ref name="football top-profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballtop.com/players/aaron-lennon |title=Aaron Lennon. Biography |publisher=Footballtop.com |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set a record as the youngest player ever to have his boots sponsored when he signed up with [[Adidas]] at the age of just 14.&lt;ref name="football top-profile" /&gt; Two years later, he began his professional career at Leeds United, where he became the youngest player to appear in the [[Premier League]] at the age of 16 years and 129 days, coming off the bench at [[White Hart Lane]] against Tottenham Hotspur in a 2–1 loss in August 2003.&lt;ref name="Leeds debut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3152277.stm |title=Kanoute grabs Spurs winner |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2003 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon scored his only goal for Leeds against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2004 during a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4107129.stm |title=Sunderland 2–3 Leeds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 December 2004 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon had been featuring from the bench up until that point, but he soon took his chance when [[John Oster]] was sacked for bad behaviour, becoming a regular starter from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/4128427.stm |title=Leeds sack Oster after incident |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb0405/&gt; His pace and skills on the wing excited Leeds fans, and he was one of the star performers in Leeds' first season in the Championship under the management of [[Kevin Blackwell]] with his performances earning rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-lennon-was-sold-on-the-cheap-deane-1-5340783 |title=Leeds United v Tottenham Hotspur: Lennon was sold on the cheap – Deane |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |location=Leeds |first=Leon |last=Wobschall |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last involvement at Leeds was playing and scoring in [[Lucas Radebe]]'s testimonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socceramworld.com/lucas-radebe-testimonial/4.html |title=The Lucas Radebe Testimonial |publisher=Soccer AM World |date=2 May 2005 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826233750/http://www.socceramworld.com/lucas-radebe-testimonial/4.html |archivedate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Leeds' financial problems, Lennon was sold to Spurs for a heavily reduced fee, with a sell-on clause inserted into the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/hull-city/tigers-target-former-leeds-teenager-lennon-to-join-relegation-battle-1-7064322 |title=Tigers target former Leeds teenager Lennon to join relegation battle |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
[[File:Aaron lennon25.jpg|thumb|upright|Lennon in 2008]]

With Leeds suffering financial difficulties, Lennon made a £1&amp;nbsp;million move to Tottenham Hotspur on 15 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2013-2014/aaron-lennon-poised-for-everton-switch_sto4587518/story.shtml |title=Everton sign Aaron Lennon on loan from Spurs |publisher=Eurosport |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Spurs debut came a couple of months later in a 2–0 home defeat against Chelsea on 27 August 2005.&lt;ref name="spurs-debut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4168856.stm |title=Tottenham 0–2 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2006, Lennon scored his first Premier League goal in Tottenham's 2–0 victory over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/report?id=185769&amp;cc=3436 |title=Birmingham 0–2 Tottenham |publisher=ESPN FC |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was nominated by fellow players for the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]] Young Player of the Year for both the [[2005–06 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2006–07]] seasons, but lost out to [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], respectively.&lt;ref name="pfa-2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4903072.stm |title=Chelsea head list of PFA nominees |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6582201.stm |title=Ronaldo secures PFA awards double |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with Tottenham on 8 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/6242677.stm |title=Lennon signs long-term Spurs deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2008, Lennon won his first major career honour as Tottenham came from a goal down to defeat Chelsea 2–1 after extra time at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008 League Cup Final]].&lt;ref name=2008LC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7256729.stm |title=Tottenham 2–1 Chelsea |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved deal was signed in March 2009 which contracted him to Spurs until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/mar/20/aaron-lennon-tottenham-contract |title=Lennon extends Spurs deal to 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon finished the 2008–09 season as the Tottenham Fans' Player of the Season, the club's Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season, and was nominated for a third successive year for PFA Young Player of the Year, this time losing out to Ashley Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8019726.stm |title=Giggs earns prestigious PFA award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 47 matches in all competitions and scored five goals, including a late equaliser in a memorable [[North London derby]] which ended 4–4 and was manager [[Harry Redknapp]]'s first match in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7684610.stm |title=Arsenal 4–4 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs finished eighth in the league and reached the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 League Cup Final]], which they lost on penalties to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a goalless draw at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref name=2009LC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7905889.stm |title=Man Utd 0–0 Tottenham (aet) |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His goals early in the [[2009–10 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2009–10 season]] – against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]], and Birmingham City – kept Tottenham at the top of the league table with four successive wins, their best start to a league season since the [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1960–61]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_5527728,00.html |title=Crouch – All up four grabs |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2009, Lennon was injured in a match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. Tottenham were consequently reduced to ten men as manager Harry Redknapp had used all three available substitutes and they would go on to lose the match 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8317280.stm |title=Tottenham 0–1 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Ian |last=Hughes |date=24 October 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on 22 November in a 9–1 victory against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and provided three assists and scored one goal. He was substituted in the 79th minute for [[David Bentley]], receiving a standing ovation from the fans at White Hart Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8365091.stm |title=Tottenham 9–1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon suffered a groin injury in December 2009 which kept him out of the team during the first months of 2010 and in the run up to the [[2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/8529463.stm |title=Aaron Lennon out for six weeks with injury – Redknapp |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return from injury in a 3–1 defeat against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] on 24 April 2010, appearing as a second-half substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-3-1-tottenham-report-3359272 |title=Manchester United 3–1 Tottenham: Two Giggs penalties and a Nani stunner keep Fergie's title hopes alive |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2010, he scored a last minute winner in a 2–1 victory against [[Liverpool]] at White Hart Lane after a [[Benoît Assou-Ekotto]] long ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/nov/28/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league |title=Aaron Lennon's late blast sees Tottenham sink Liverpool |newspaper=The Guardian |first=David |last=Hytner |location=London |date=28 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2011, Lennon went on a blistering run as Tottenham counter-attacked and then delivered a perfect pass to assist [[Peter Crouch]] in a 1–0 win over [[A.C.

On 1 September 2012, he signed a four-year deal keeping him at the club until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19448389 |title=Aaron Lennon signs a new four-year deal at Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, he was named captain for the first time for a [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match against [[S.S.

===Everton===
On 2 February 2015, Lennon was loaned to fellow Premier League club Everton for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aaron Lennon: Everton sign Tottenham winger on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31104228 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club as a substitute in the [[Merseyside derby]] against Liverpool on 7 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/02/08/lennon-buzzing-after-derby-debut |title=Lennon 'Buzzing' After Derby Debut |date=8 February 2015 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Everton in a 2–1 win against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at [[Loftus Road]] on 22 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/22/qpr-everton-premier-league-match-report |title=Everton sink relegation-bound QPR thanks to late Aaron Lennon goal |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Paul |last=Doyle |location=London |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Spurs briefly, for the beginning of the [[2015–16 Everton F.C. season|2015–16 season]], but was sent to train with the Under-21 squad and was not given a squad number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11756696/Aaron-Lennon-trains-with-youth-team-as-Tottenham-exit-draws-closer.html |title=Aaron Lennon trains with youth team as Tottenham exit draws closer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Matt |last=Law |location=London |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/squad-numbers-070815/ |title=2015–16 Premier League squad numbers announced |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |date=7 August 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2015, Lennon rejoined Everton permanently on a three-year deal for a reported fee of £4.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/09/01/lennon-returns |title=Lennon Returns |publisher=Everton F.C. |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2592716/aaron-lennon-joins-everton-from-tottenham-on-three-year-deal |title=Aaron Lennon joins Everton from Tottenham on three-year deal |publisher=ESPN FC |first=Mike |last=Whalley |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began 2016 in a rich vein of form, scoring in a 1–1 draw at home to former club Tottenham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3382783/Everton-1-1-Tottenham-Dele-Alli-cancels-Aaron-Lennon-s-opener-superb-volley-half-stoppage-time.html |title=Everton 1–1 Tottenham: Dele Alli cancels out Aaron Lennon's opener with superb volley in first-half stoppage time |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ladyman |date=3 January 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} and in three successive Everton wins in late January and early February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-vs-west-brom-preview-aaron-lennon-hoping-to-maintain-impressive-form-against-baggies-a6869891.html |title=Everton vs West Brom preview: Aaron Lennon hoping to maintain impressive form against Baggies |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |first=Benjamin |last=Youell |date=12 February 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon continued his scoring run in a 3–1 away win at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35637723 |title=Aston Villa 1–3 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Neil |last=Johnston |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also netted in a 3–2 home loss to West Ham United on 5 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35675847 |title=Everton 2–3 West Ham United |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Patrick |last=Jennings |date=5 March 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this form proved to be short-lived as results for the team worsened and a poor end to the season led to the sacking of manager [[Roberto Martínez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toffeeweb.com/players/profiles/Lennon.php |title=Aaron Lennon |publisher=ToffeeWeb |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[2016–17 Everton F.C. season|The new season]] had a more frustrating feel as Lennon found himself well down the pecking order when new boss [[Ronald Koeman]] took charge of the club. Lennon had played just 14 minutes of football during the first two months of Everton's league campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/time-evertons-aaron-lennon-come-12081522 |title=Is it time for Everton's Aaron Lennon to come in from the cold? |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |first=Glen |last=Williams |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his first league start coming on 19 November 2016 in a home match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-team-news-aaron-lennon-12201121 |title=Everton team news – Aaron Lennon and James McCarthy start against Swansea City |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |date=19 November 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnley===
On 23 January 2018, Lennon signed for Premier League club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42792135 |title=Lennon completes move to Burnley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 January 2018 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lennon was called up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21 team]] for the first time in October 2005 and on 8 May 2006, he was picked in [[England national football team|England]]'s [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] squad, despite being only 19 years of age and uncapped at senior level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/08/newsstory.sport7 |title=Eriksson gambles on Walcott |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 May 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |location=London |first=Sean |last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named [[man of the match]] in the [[England national football B team|England B]] encounter against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] on 25 May 2006 in England's World Cup warm-up match at the [[Madejski Stadium]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], which England B ultimately lost 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/commentary?gameId=198168 |title=England B vs. Belarus B – Football Match Commentary |publisher=ESPN FC |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full England debut as a second-half substitute in the 6–0 win over [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] on 3 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/players/player=69587/profile/index.html |title=Aaron Lennon |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon appeared as a second-half substitute for England in their 2006 World Cup group stage match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] (his first World Cup finals appearance). England scored twice following his and Wayne Rooney's arrival on the field, winning the match 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853008.stm |title=England 2–0 Trinidad &amp; Tobago |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon then played in the quarter-final match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], coming on as a substitute for the injured [[David Beckham]]. Lennon was then himself substituted for [[Jamie Carragher]] immediately prior to a penalty shootout, in which England lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991618.stm |title=England 0–0 Portugal (Portugal win 3–1 on penalties) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon also came on as a substitute during a 5–0 [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Euro 2008 qualifying]] victory over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] on 2 September 2006 and made an instant impact by assisting Peter Crouch's second goal after receiving the ball for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5289630.stm |title=England 5–0 Andorra |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start for England in a Euro 2008 qualifier against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in March 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-458774/Lennon-undergoes-surgery.html |title=Lennon undergoes surgery |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} and was also selected in the first XI for the following match against Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6497817.stm |title=Andorra 0–3 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be Lennon's last appearance for exactly two years as it wasn't until 28 March 2009 that he was selected again by England, starting in a friendly match with [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/5062756/Aaron-Lennon-hits-his-stride-at-just-the-right-time-to-give-England-cutting-edge.html |title=Aaron Lennon hits his stride at just the right time to give England cutting edge |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Alan |last=Smith |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7967094.stm |title=England 4–0 Slovakia |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon started again for England when they played [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] on 1 April 2009 at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7973880.stm |title=England 2–1 Ukraine |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called up for the friendly against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|World Cup qualifier]] versus [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], following his fine form for Tottenham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8229098.stm |title=Capello recalls Crouch and Lennon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named man of the match in the 5–1 win over Croatia, their biggest defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1212480/Aaron-Lennon-booked-World-Cup-place-Croatia-display-says-England-captain-John-Terry.html |title=Aaron Lennon has booked his World Cup place with Croatia display, says England captain John Terry |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}

'''Phillip Anthony Bardsley''' (born 28 June 1985) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. Although born in England, Bardsley qualifies for Scotland through his [[Glasgow]]-born father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/rangers/201311-phil-bardsley-called-into-scotland-squad-for-euro-2012-games/ Phil Bardsley called into Scotland squad for Euro 2012 games]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardsley began his career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].

He joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in January 2008 for an initial fee of £850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the [[Stadium of Light]] under [[Steve Bruce]] and [[Martin O'Neill]] and he won the player of the year award in [[2010–11 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2010–11]]. He lost his place in the team in [[2012–13 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2012–13]] after a falling-out with manager [[Paolo Di Canio]], before returning to the first team under [[Gus Poyet]]. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in [[2013–14 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2013–14]] and reach the [[2014 Football League Cup Final]], in which they lost 3–1 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

After his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on a free transfer. He spent three seasons with the club before joining [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in July 2017.

==Early life==
Bardsley attended [[Hope High School (Salford)|Hope High School]] in his hometown, Salford, along with former United teammates [[Mark Redshaw]] and [[Mark Howard (defender)|Mark Howard]]. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United.&lt;ref name="Sport Vibe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Redshaw – FC Oss |url=http://www.sportsvibe.co.uk/features/football/brits-abroad-11265/mark-redshaw-fc-oss-12492/ |work=Sports Vibe |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407012507/http://www.sportsvibe.co.uk/features/football/brits-abroad-11265/mark-redshaw-fc-oss-12492/ |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up near Manchester United's old training ground, [[The Cliff (training ground)|The Cliff]], and would often go there on his school holidays to see the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.&lt;ref name="Sport Vibe"/&gt;

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
After coming through the club's youth system, Bardsley was a regular in Manchester United's under-17 team from the 2000–01 season, before progressing to the under-19s from the 2002–03 season. He continued in the under-19s in [[2003–04 Manchester United F.C. season|2003–04]], but appeared more frequently in the reserves before making his first-team debut in a 2–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 3 December 2003 in the fourth round of the [[2003–04 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baggies bounce Man Utd out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3246994.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=3 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a second appearance for the first team in the 3–0 [[FA Cup]] fourth round win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on 25 January 2004, before going on a four-month loan to Manchester United's Belgian feeder club, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northampton 0–3 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3403761.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=25 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made six appearances for Royal Antwerp, including a 4–0 defeat to [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on 8 February 2004, in which he was sent off for two bookable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Club Brugge K.V. 4–0 R. Antwerp F.C. |url=http://www.rafcmuseum.be/wedstrijdarchief/wedstrijdfiche.php?matchid=1730 |publisher=R.A.F.C.-Museum (Royal Antwerp FC) |accessdate=23 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Manchester United at the end of 2003–04, Bardsley made three appearances on the club's [[2004–05 Manchester United F.C. season|2004–05]] pre-season tour of the United States, playing against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. He made another promising start to the [[2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season|2005–06]] season, and an injury to [[Gary Neville]] gave him plenty of opportunities to play between August and November 2005. He was regularly named as a substitute for much of the rest of the season, before going on loan to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 16 March 2006. He played six matches and scored an own goal in the first minute of a 1–1 draw at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burnley 1–1 Southampton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4842462.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Rangers====
Bardsley again made a significant contribution to Manchester United's pre-season programme in [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]], but on 16 August, he was sent out on loan again, this time to [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rangers sign up Bardsley on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4799891.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 2006, he scored his only goal for Rangers against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] with a terrific long-range free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/5325254.stm |title=Rangers 4–0 Falkirk |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hibernians 2–1 Rangers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5345670.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2006 |accessdate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore missed the [[Old Firm]] match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. On 17 October, it was reported that Bardsley was involved in a training ground disagreement with manager [[Paul Le Guen]] and his future at Rangers appeared to be in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bardsley axed after boss bust-up |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6061000.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Bardsley never played for Rangers again and returned to Manchester United in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Trafford duo make Ibrox exit |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6216885.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Aston Villa====
On 8 January 2007, Bardsley joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on loan until the end of the season and played his first [[Premier League]] match against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tactical Formation |work=Football-Lineups.com |url=http://www.football-lineups.com/wiki/_match3473.php |accessdate=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 1 May that Bardsley would be returning to Manchester United when his loan deal with Villa ran out as manager [[Martin O'Neill]] did not want to make the move permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phil's United Return |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1019107,00.html |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |date=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006014134/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1019107,00.html |archivedate=6 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Sheffield United====
After playing what would turn out to be his last match for the Manchester United first team against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the League Cup on 26 September 2007, it was confirmed on 15 October Bardsley would join [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on loan until January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd's Bardsley in Blades loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/7044929.stm |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full debut for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 draw with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at Bramall Lane. Despite Sheffield United agreeing a deal with Manchester United to sign him permanently,&lt;ref name="Bardsley loan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bardsley Deal Fear |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-united/Bardsley-deal-fear.3645259.jp |work=Sheffield Star |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley left at the end of his loan deal in January 2008 after playing 16 matches.

===Sunderland===
[[File:Phil Bardsley 2.jpg|thumb|Bardsley for Sunderland in a pre-season friendly against [[York City F.C.|York City]]]]
On 22 January 2008, Bardsley joined Sunderland on a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth an initial £850,000, potentially rising to £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunderland complete Bardsley signing |url=http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=14043 |work=safc.com |publisher=Sunderland AFC |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124045034/http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=14043 |archivedate=24 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bardsley makes Sunderland switch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7203422.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 2–0 win against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Premier League on 29 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunderland 2–0 Birmingham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7210578.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley played 11 times under [[Roy Keane]] in [[2007–08 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2007–08]] as Sunderland successfully avoided relegation by three points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keane brings out best in Bardsley|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7340689.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Keane prepares to wield axe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7381027.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2008 Bardsley scored his first goal in English football in a 2–1 victory against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottm Forest 1–2 Sunderland (aet) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7576515.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley lost out to [[Pascal Chimbonda]] during the first half of the [[2008–09 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2008–09]] campaign before regaining his place in the team in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bardsley determined to keep place|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7742062.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his place under [[Ricky Sbragia]], playing in total 33 times in 2008–09 as Sunderland survived relegation on the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanghera|first=Mandeep|title=Sunderland 2–3 Chelsea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048317.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008/09"/&gt;

He was in fine form, and netted another goal in his next start against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] on 2 February 2013. The match eventually finished 2–1 to Watford, with Vydra assisting [[Almen Abdi]]'s winning goal. After three matches without a goal, Vydra netted his 20th goal of the campaign in a 2–1 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 23 February 2013.

'''Adam Richard Legzdins''' (born 28 November 1986) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

Legzdins began his career with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], from where he spent time on loan at several lower-division clubs but never played first-team football for his parent club. In 2008, he joined [[Crewe Alexandra]], with whom he made his debut in [[the Football League]], but played only infrequently. He spent the 2010–11 season as [[Football League Two]] club [[Burton Albion]]'s first-choice goalkeeper, earning himself a move to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] of the [[Football League Championship]]. He played 35 matches over three seasons with Derby, mainly in 2012–13, and after a year with [[Leyton Orient]], he rejoined Birmingham City in 2015. After two seasons and 21 appearances, he signed for Burnley.

He qualifies to play international football for [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] via his paternal grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/local/Saturday-Spotlight--Adam39s-here.1261084.jp |title=Saturday Spotlight – Adam's here to learn |newspaper=Halifax Courier |date=19 November 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Legzdins was born in [[Penkridge]], Staffordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hugman |editor1-first=Barry J. |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2007–08 |publisher=Mainstream |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |page=245 |isbn=978-1-84596-246-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came through [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'s [[Birmingham City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Academy]] system and played his first competitive football in October 2005 on [[loan (association football)|loan]] at [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]] in the [[Conference North]], four games which included a [[man of the match]] performance away at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alfretontownfc.com/herefordunited221005report.htm |title=2005/06 season match No.14 |author=Foster, Gordon |publisher=Alfreton Town F.C. |date=23 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115233421/http://www.alfretontownfc.com/herefordunited221005report.htm |archivedate=15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] of the [[Conference National]] on a work experience basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/4417624.stm |title=Shaymen seal swoop for Legzdins |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played 11 games before Birmingham recalled him, concerned that regular [[first-team]] football for Halifax combined with playing for Birmingham's [[reserve team]] was too much for the 19-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/4642604.stm |title=Shaymen lose City keeper Legzdins |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamLegzdins cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Warming up before a [[Football League Championship|Championship]] match at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], August 2006]]Legzdins signed his first one-year professional contract in the summer of 2006. Early in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] he was given a Birmingham squad number because of an injury to first choice keeper [[Maik Taylor]], and was an unused [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in their [[Football League Championship|Championship]] match at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10412~35971,00.html |title=Adam Legzdins |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514131236/http://www.blues.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0%2C%2C10412~35971%2C00.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 he joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on loan where he acted as backup to [[Les Pogliacomi]], making one substitute appearance in the [[Football League Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oldham_athletic/6181952.stm |title=Oldham extend Legzdins' loan deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 November 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] on loan and was expected to go straight into the starting eleven due to injury and suspension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/macclesfield_town/s/233062_preview_barnet_v_macclesfield |title=Preview: Barnet v Macclesfield |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |author=Carter, Simon |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but manager [[Paul Ince]] chose goalkeeping coach [[David Rouse]] instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10393~33003,00.html |title=Barnet 1 Macclesfield 0 |last=Brooks |first=Nick |publisher=Macclesfield Town F.C. |date=13 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326170152/http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10393~33003%2C00.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Legzdins completed his month's loan without appearing for the club.

It was a very important save."&lt;ref name="briscgame"/&gt; Legzdins' run of 30 consecutive first-team starts ended in March 2013 when Clough felt the need for Fielding's greater experience ahead of Derby's 2–1 win against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Centre-halves-won-Leicester-game-says-Derby/story-18449567-detail/story.html |title=Centre-halves 'won us the Leicester game,' says Derby County's Nigel Clough |newspaper=Derby Telegraph |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526021548/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Centre-halves-won-Leicester-game-says-Derby/story-18449567-detail/story.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five weeks later, Legzdins returned to first-team action after Fielding was sent off for a professional foul against Peterborough United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133302 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Derby 3–1 Peterborough |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he started the final two games of the season, ending the season with 33 first-team appearances. After Derby signed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]'s [[Lee Grant (footballer born 1983)|Lee Grant]] in May, Legzdins was made available for transfer with a year left on his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-listen-offers-Fielding-Legzdins/story-18914541-detail/story.html |newspaper=Derby Telegraph |first=Steve |last=Nicholson |title=Rams will listen to offers for Fielding and Legzdins |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002512/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-listen-offers-Fielding-Legzdins/story-18914541-detail/story.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legzdins was originally not given a squad number for the [[2013–14 Derby County F.C. season|2013–14 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/2013-14-squad-numbers-announced-915805.aspx |publisher=Derby County F.C. |title=2013–14 squad numbers announced|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after featuring in first-team pre-season friendlies he was assigned the squad number 26 in late July and went into the season as second choice to Grant.

===Leyton Orient===
Legzdins signed for [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on 13 June 2014. He signed a two-year contract with the East London club after being released by Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Legzdins: Leyton Orient sign Derby County goalkeeper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27835791 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the club by mutual consent on 1 June 2015 after his appearances during the 2014–15 season were restricted by injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32962766 |title=Adam Legzdins: Leyton Orient terminate keeper's contract |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first league appearance of the [[2016–17 Birmingham City F.C. season|2016–17 season]] when Kuszczak succumbed to a pre-existing injury during the warm-up before Birmingham's match away to Reading on 13 September; he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-11883348 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett on Adam Legzdins' first team prospects after surprise chance |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place for the next seven matches, even after Kuszczak's return to fitness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-12059078 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett gives his thoughts on Adam Legzdins |first=Joseph |last=Chapman |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but manager [[Gary Rowett]] brought Kuszczak back into the side for the [[Second City derby|local derby]] against [[Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-12103526 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett discusses decision to drop Adam Legzdins |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=31 October 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four more appearances in the second half of the season: two in the FA Cup,&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; and two in the league, on both occasions as a half-time substitute for the injured Kuszczak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-gianfranco-zola-head-12487264 |title=Birmingham City: Gianfranco Zola on the head injury to Tomasz Kuszczak |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=21 January 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/report?gameId=452702 |title=Birmingham City 0–2 Burton Albion |publisher=ESPN |agency=PA Sport |date=17 April 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Birmingham took up their option to extend his contract for a further year, Legzdins said he was "absolutely delighted" to accept, in preference to offers from elsewhere, "because everybody who knows me knows how much the club means to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-legzdins-happy-pick-birmingham-13099396 |title=Adam Legzdins happy to pick Birmingham City over other offers |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=27 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnley===
The arrival of [[David Stockdale]] left Legzdins third in Birmingham's pecking order for 2017–18, and [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] were in need of a goalkeeper after [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]]'s retirement left them without sufficient backup for [[Tom Heaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ex-burton-albion-goalkeeper-adam-297582 |title=Ex-Burton Albion goalkeeper Adam Legzdins linked with Premier League move away from Birmingham City |first=Josh |last=Murray |newspaper=Burton Mail |date=8 August 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2017, Legzdins signed a three-year contract with Burnley; the fee was undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/august/clarets-sign-legzdins/ |title=Clarets sign Legzdins |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=8 August 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Dunne''' (3 September 1905&amp;nbsp;– 14 November 1949) was an Irish [[association football|footballer]] who played for, among others, [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. Dunne was also a [[dual Irish international footballers|dual internationalist]] and played for both Ireland teams: the [[Irish Free State national football team|FAI XI]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. Dunne holds the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football.

Dunne was the first Irishman to figure prominently in the [[Football League|English League]] scoring records. In the [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]] season he scored 41 league goals for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. This became a club record and remains the most league goals scored by an Irishman during a single English League season.

In the [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32]] season, he scored in 12 consecutive matches. This is the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football. Dunne also scored 30 or more [[Football League First Division|First Division]] goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. He excelled at either centre forward or inside forward and was outstanding with his head. On 27 September 1930 he scored a [[hat-trick]] of headers against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. He was a fringe member of the great [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] side of the 1930s before finishing his career at [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].

Dunne died suddenly from a heart attack, at the age of 44, on 14 November 1949. His two sons, [[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1932)|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dunne (footballer born 1935)|Jimmy]], also played in the [[League of Ireland]] for [[St. Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St. Patrick's Athletic]]. Tommy also played for [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. His nephew, [[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1927)|another Tommy Dunne]], also played for Rovers and another nephew [[Christy Doyle]], played for [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

==Club career==

===Early years===
Dunne initially played junior football. However his career was put on hold during the [[Irish Civil War]] when he was interned by the [[Irish Free State]] authorities for alleged [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] sympathies. His brother, Christy, was an active Republican. He subsequently joined [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and played a number of games for the club's senior team. A scout recommended him to [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]], then playing in the [[Football League Third Division North|English Third Division North]]. Dunne joined New Brighton in November 1925 and made an instant impact, scoring six goals in eight league games.&lt;ref name="The FAI International Story 1997"&gt;''The Boys in Green – The FAI International Story'' (1997): Sean Ryan ({{ISBN|978-1-85158-939-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NIF"&gt;[http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/11/jimmy-dunne.html Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheffield United===
Dunne soon attracted the interest of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] who signed him in February 1926 for £800. However this marked the start of another apprenticeship in the reserves. He made his first team debut in a 4–0 home win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 4 September 1926 but he struggled to hold a regular place and in his first three seasons played just eleven league games. His first goal came against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 15 October 1927. Dunne had to wait three years before he became an established member of the United team and at one stage they put him on the transfer list. It was not until the [[1929–30 in English football#First Division|1929–30]] season that Dunne became a goalscoring sensation. His first hat-trick against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in a 3–3 draw on 7 September 1929 was followed by successive four-goal hauls against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on New Year's Day (4–2) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (7–1) three days later. He scored another hat-trick against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 March. He finished the season as the club's top goalscorer with 36 goals in 39 games and his goals helped United avoid relegation on goal average.

Dunne was subsequently top goalscorer at United for four consecutive seasons between 1929 and 1933. This included scoring over 30 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. His best season was [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]], when he scored 41 league goals plus a further nine in other competitions; his 41-goal haul remains the record tally in the English League by an Irishman. Dunne holds the all-time record of goals scored in consecutive matches at the elite level of English football: between 24 October 1931 and 1 January 1932, he scored in 12 games in succession.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jamie Vardy to Cristiano Ronaldo: Weird &amp; wonderful goal records|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34402082|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
Dunne's goalscoring form with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] soon attracted the interest of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. In early 1932 they offered United £10,000 for Dunne but were turned down. However, in September 1933, after United hit financial trouble, they accepted a reduced fee of £8,250. Dunne made his debut for Arsenal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 30 September 1933 in a 6–0 win, and went on to score 9 goals in 23 league games during the [[1933–34 in English football#First Division|1933–34]] season, helping Arsenal win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. However, the arrival of [[Ted Drake]] in the summer of 1934 saw Dunne lose his place in the Arsenal first team, and he would only play another 8 games over the next two seasons. Dunne was dubbed "the most expensive reserve player in English football" in the press, although his Arsenal colleagues clearly recognised his talents, with [[Cliff Bastin]] remarking he was "one of the best five centre forwards I had ever seen".&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;

===Southampton===
In July 1936 Dunne signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] where he was nicknamed "Snowy" by the fans because of his fair hair.&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alphabet of the Saints|last= Holley |first= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary|publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-9514862-3-3|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "dangerous in the air (with) a short striding run which enabled him to retain his balance in quick moves near the goal",&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt; he was the Saints' leading scorer during the [[1936–37 in English football#Second Division|1936–37]] season, scoring 14 league goals in 36 games, helping Southampton to avoid relegation to the Third Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|last2=Holley|first2= Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books|year=1987|isbn= 0-907969-22-4|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, Dunne turned down the opportunity to renew his contract at Southampton and opted to return to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt; Eighteen months after leaving the club, Dunne was given a rousing salute by Southampton dockers as he passed through the port with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] team.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt;

===Shamrock Rovers===
In 1937 Dunne returned to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] as player-manager and was the inspiration behind Rovers winning [[League of Ireland]] titles in 1938 and 1939. He won 9 caps during this spell at Milltown. He also helped Rovers win the [[FAI Cup]] in 1940. The reserves had won the Leinster Senior League Division 1 title that season and they were coached by Dunne whose first medal with Rovers was the Leinster Senior League Division 1.

On 31 August 1942 Rovers played [[Belfast Celtic]] in a testimonial for Dunne which ended in a 2–2 draw. Dunne went on to coach [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] between 1942 and 1947 before returning to Rovers once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/history.php www.shamrockrovers.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801163442/http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/history.php |date= 1 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish international==
When Dunne began his international career in 1928 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the [[Northern Ireland]] – based [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and the [[Irish Free State]] – based [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Dunne, played for both teams.

===IFA XI===
Between [[1928 British Home Championship|1928]] and 1932 Dunne made 7 appearances and scored 4 goals for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. Dunne made his debut for the IFA XI on 2 February 1928 in a 2–1 defeat against [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. He won his second cap for the IFA XI on 20 October [[1931 British Home Championship|1930]] against [[England national football team|England]] and scored in a 5–1 defeat. During 1931 he scored a further three goals for the IFA XI and as a result scored 4 goals in four consecutive appearances.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;

===FAI XI===
Between 1930 and 1939 Dunne also made 15 appearances and scored 13 goals for the [[Irish Free State national football team|FAI XI]]. He made his debut for the FAI XI on 11 May 1930 in an away game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Dunne marked his debut with a brilliant all round performance, scoring twice in a 3–1 win. He also scored on his home debut for the FAI XI on 17 March 1936 in a 1–0 win against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. In May 1936, during a European tour, he scored five goals for the FAI XI. On 3 May he scored twice in a 3–3 draw with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. On 3 May he also scored in a 4–1 defeat to a Rhineland XI and then on 9 May scored twice in a 5–1 win against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. On 10 October 1937 Dunne scored for the FAI XI in a [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup]] qualifier against [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Norway, who won the game 3–2, later complained that Dunne was ineligible, having played for the IFA XI, who were not members of [[FIFA]]. The complaint was subsequently withdraw and on 7 November, Dunne scored in the return which finished as a 3–3 draw. He scored his last goal for the FAI XI in a 3–2 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 13 November 1938 and made his final appearance against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 23 May 1939.&lt;ref name="The FAI International Story 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=246 Ireland (FAI) stats]&lt;/ref&gt;
