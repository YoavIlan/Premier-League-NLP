'''Hugo Hadrien Dominique Lloris''' ({{IPA-fr|yɡo joʁis}}; born 26 December 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and is the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of both English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[France national football team|French national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2012-02-28/hugo-lloris-named-as-frances-euro-2012-captain |title=Hugo Lloris named as France's Euro 2012 captain |work=[[Sporting News]] |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711223900/http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2012-02-28/hugo-lloris-named-as-frances-euro-2012-captain |archivedate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris is described as a goalkeeper who "boasts lightning reflexes and good decision-making" and is "a formidable opponent in one-on-one situations". Lloris also "commands his box well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/43372/hugo-lloris?cc=5901 |title=Hugo Lloris ESPN Profile |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His playing style, and in particular his speed when coming off his line to anticipate opponents and clear the ball, has led him to be described as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)#Sweeper-keeper|sweeper-keeper]] in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |title=Tottenham's Hugo Lloris is Premier League's supreme sweeper-keeper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/13/tottenham-hugo-lloris-premier-league-sweeper-keeper |accessdate=11 May 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a three-time winner of the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year]] award.

Lloris began his career with hometown club [[OGC Nice]], made his debut as a teenager in October 2005 and started in goal during the team's run to the [[2006 Coupe de la Ligue Final]]. After excelling at the club for three seasons, Lloris moved to seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions Olympique Lyonnais, amid interest from several other clubs, notably [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Lloris won several domestic awards in his first season with Lyon and, in his second season, earned award nominations at European level for his performances in the [[UEFA Champions League]], which saw Lyon reach the semi-finals for the first time.

Lloris is a [[France national football team|French international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]], and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. Prior to playing at senior level, he played on the under-19 team that won the [[2005 European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Lloris made his senior international debut in November 2008 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He helped France qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and was applauded by the media for his performance over two legs against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|qualifying playoffs]]. He captained the national team for the first time in 2010, and became first-choice captain on 28 February 2012, leading France into the quarter-finals of both [[Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], runners-up at [[Euro 2016]], and winners at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early and personal life==
Lloris was born on 26 December 1986 in the [[Southern France|Mediterranean]] city of [[Nice]] to an upper-class family. His mother was a lawyer and his father is a [[Monte Carlo]]-based banker of [[Pays Catalan|Catalan]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesechos.fr/22/06/2012/LesEchos/21211-189-ECH_hugo-lloris.htm |title=Hugo Lloris |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2015 |work=Les Échos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="hugo_lloris"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=673250&amp;cc=5901 |title=Champions League 2009–10, Group E |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philippebilger.com/blog/2010/04/hugo-lloris-un-dernier-rempart.html |title=Hugo Lloris: un dernier rempart |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=Philippe Bilger |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother, [[Gautier Lloris|Gautier]], who currently plays as a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]] for his older brother's former club [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/gautier-lloris-sur-les-traces-de-son-frere-08-03-2011-1348292.php |title=Gautier Lloris sur les traces de son frère |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cote-d-azur.france3.fr/info/nice-en-finale-de-la-coupe-gambardella-a-paris-73609914.html |title=Nice en finale de la Coupe Gambardella à Paris |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |work=France 3 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, while Lloris was playing for Nice, his mother died. Just two days after her death, he gained national respect for his refusal of a [[Grief|bereavement]] leave offer from manager [[Frédéric Antonetti]], instead opting to play in a league match for Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=773826&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;root=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5901 |title=Lloris the key for Lyon's hopes |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris performed admirably in the match despite the circumstances. As a youth, like his international and club teammate [[Yoann Gourcuff]], Lloris excelled at tennis and played the sport up until the age of 13. He was among the top players in his age group, ranking high in the country's national standings before opting to focus on football.&lt;ref name ="hugo_lloris" /&gt;

On 10 August 2010, Lloris was named, alongside international teammate [[Karim Benzema]], to appear on the cover of the French version of ''[[FIFA 11]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.info-utiles.fr/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4182 |title=EA-Sport signe Hugo LLoris pour FiFa 11 |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2010 |publisher=Info Utiles |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2010, he announced the birth of his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.olweb.fr/fr/Actualites-sportives/100005/En-bref/54197/Carnet-rose |title=Carnet rose |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010 |publisher=[[Olympique Lyonnais]] |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014409/http://www.olweb.fr/fr/Actualites-sportives/100005/En-bref/54197/Carnet-rose |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2018, Lloris was charged with [[Driving under the influence|drink-driving]] after being stopped by police in west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45297105 |title=Hugo Lloris: Tottenham goalkeeper charged with drink-driving |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2018 |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris later pleaded guilty at [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]] and admitted to being more than twice the drink-drive limit. He was fined £50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45482366 |title=Hugo Lloris admits drink-driving charge |date=2018-09-12 |work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-12 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lloris began his football career at age six playing at CEDAC (Centre de Diffusion et d'Action Culturelle), a local [[cultural center]] based in the neighborhood of [[Cimiez]], Nice.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=22&amp;id=AT2539 |title=Pouplin – Lloris : Deux garçons pleins d'avenir |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 |publisher=[[Stade Rennais F.C.]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |title=Présentation du CEDAC Cimiez |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=CEDAC Cimiez |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409081208/http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |archivedate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre offered a variety of activities, which included football. Lloris played a variety of positions at the centre, such as [[Striker (association football)|in the attack]], before switching to the goalkeeper position after coaches noticed that he possessed impressive goalkeeping qualities, such as ball-handling and catching skills.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons" /&gt; Lloris excelled at the position and caught the attention of former [[OGC Nice]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and French international [[Dominique Baratelli]], who recommended that the player join his former club. At the age of ten, Lloris joined Nice's youth academy.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons" /&gt; He spent several years in the club's youth academy and was the starting goalkeeper for the club's under-17 team that won the 2003–04 edition of the ''Championnat Nationaux des 18 ans'', a country-wide domestic league competition for players under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ogcnissa.com/fr.php?Rubrique=articles&amp;id_art=1916 |title=Bilan des 18 ans Nationaux |date=22 May 2004 |accessdate=22 March 2011 |publisher=OGC Nissa |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
[[File:Hugo Lloris.JPG|thumb|175px|left|Lloris in 2005 with [[OGC Nice|Nice]]]]
After success with the club's under-18 team, Lloris was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of French football, for the 2004–05 season. He alternated the starting goalkeeper spot with Hilaire Munoz as he appeared in 12 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stat2foot.com/nopclubs/nice20405.htm |title=O.G.C.

He was designated by manager [[Frédéric Antonetti]] as the team's starting goalkeeper for the club's [[Coupe de la Ligue]] campaign ahead of fan-favourite (and fellow Nice native) [[Damien Gregorini]], who was relied more upon in league play. Lloris made his professional debut on 25 October 2005, at the age of 18, recording a clean sheet in Nice's 2–0 Coupe de la Ligue win over [[LB Châteauroux|Châteauroux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120711075823/http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 11 July 2012 |title=Nice v. Châteauroux Match Report |date=25 October 2005 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded another clean sheet the following round against [[CS Sedan Ardennes|Sedan]] and helped Nice upset favorites [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and [[Derby de la Côte d'Azur]] rivals [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, meaning the club had reached its first-ever Coupe de la Ligue final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50479 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120710212447/http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50479 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 10 July 2012 |title=Nice v.

Nice Match Report |date=22 April 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloris made his league debut on 18 March 2006 against Nancy picking up a [[clean sheet]] in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120712074225/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 12 July 2012 |title=Nice v. Nancy Match Report |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four more league appearances that season. The [[2006–07 Ligue 1|following season]], Lloris was given the starting job permanently ahead of Gregorini, who subsequently departed the club for Nancy. Lloris appeared in all but one league match recording 13 clean sheets as Nice finished in 16th place. Despite the disappointing finish, the club was the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals. Only veterans [[Grégory Coupet]], [[Cédric Carrasso]] and [[Ulrich Ramé]] conceded fewer. For the early part of the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]], Lloris endured a recurring ligament injury in his left knee, which forced him to miss three weeks in September. He returned to the team on 6 October 2007 in a league match against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]], but was substituted out after 71 minutes after the injury relapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/ligue-1/2007-2008/lloris-le-bout-du-tunnel_sto1387435/story.shtml |title=Lloris le bout du tunnel |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Eurosport |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712112513/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Le Mans v. Nice Match Report |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris missed a further six weeks before returning on 24 November in the team's 2–1 victory over [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51400 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730080620/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51400 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Nice v. Paris SG Match Report |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared consistently with the team for the rest of the season as Nice finished in 8th place, the club's best finish in the league since finishing 6th in the [[1988–89 French Division 1|1988–89 season]]. Lloris conceded only 24 goals in his 30 appearances recording 13 clean sheets. He contributed to a defense that only conceded 30 overall during the season, tied for the league-best. Lloris' efforts that season led to him being approached by several big European clubs with hopes of signing him for the future.

===Lyon===
After another solid season with Nice, speculation arose as to where Lloris would play the following season. He was primarily linked to French club [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], who wanted him to replace the departing Grégory Coupet, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who wanted him to replace the Brazilian [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], who wanted Lloris to replace [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.soccernews.com/lyon-deny-coupet-rumours/2325/ |title=Lyon deny Coupet rumours |date=23 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Soccer News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eyefootball.com/news/5681/Hugo-Lloris-to-AC-Milan/ |title=Hugo Lloris to AC Milan |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Eye Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3622045,00.html |title=Lloris open to Spurs talks |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[Sky Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reportedly coming to personal terms with Milan, Lloris snubbed the Italian club for seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions Lyon.

====2008–09 season====
Lloris made his club debut in the team's opening league match of the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]] on 10 August 2008 against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. Lyon won the match 3–0 win giving the goalkeeper his first career clean sheet with the club.&lt;ref name="Lyon v.

Lloris was, subsequently, named the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|top goalkeeper]] and also named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football#2009|Team of the Year]].

====2009–10 season====
In the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]], Lloris remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper and opened the new campaign by recording four clean sheets in the club's first eight matches. For his performances in the month of September, he was awarded the [[UNFP Player of the Month]] becoming the first goalkeeper since [[Steve Mandanda]] in August 2008 to receive the award. Lloris earned media praise for his performances against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the first match, played at [[Anfield]], Lloris made four saves holding Liverpool to only one goal. Lyon won the match 2–1. In the second match at the [[Stade Gerland]], he produced stops from shots by [[Fernando Torres]], [[Dirk Kuyt]] and [[Andriy Voronin]] in the first half, then displayed reflexes to deny the Brazilian [[Lucas Leiva|Lucas]] midway through the second period. Though Lyon conceded late, the team drew the match 1–1 with a goal from [[Lisandro López]] in [[injury time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1128744.html |title=Lyon delight, Liverpool despair |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000028/match=2000413/index.html |title=Lyon through as Liverpool teeter |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2009, Lloris, alongside Marseille and France's number two goalkeeper [[Steve Mandanda]], each conceded five goals in a [[Choc des Olympiques#Notable matches|thrilling 5–5 draw]] between Lyon and Marseille, though most of the goals conceded were attributed to "slack defending" displayed by both clubs as described by the media and both managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/44961 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120713172345/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/44961 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 13 July 2012 |title=Lyon v.

Lloris remained consistent during the 2010 portion of the season conceding only two goals in the club's first four matches of the year with Lyon winning all of them and Lloris picking up two clean sheets. On 16 February, Lloris earned a clean sheet in Lyon's first leg of its [[UEFA Champions League]] knockout round match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Lloris made two saves in the team's 1–0 victory making a finger-tipping save from a deflected [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] shot in the 61st minute and producing a reflex save on a shot from [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] three minutes later to keep Lyon ahead on the scoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/16/lyon-real-madrid-latest-score |title=Lyon v Real Madrid – as it happened! |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Lutz |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-cup/news/news.aspx?id=4289941 |title=Rooney, United edge Milan; Lyon stuns Real |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Sports Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180806/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-cup%2Fnews%2Fnews.aspx%3Fid%3D4289941 |archivedate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon later achieved qualification to the quarterfinals in the competition after drawing 1–1 in [[Madrid]] with Lloris conceding the opening goal to Cristiano Ronaldo in the sixth minute. It was the goalkeeper's first goal conceded in over 620 minutes. On 2 May, Lloris provided the assist on the game-winning goal scored by [[Michel Bastos]] in Lyon's 1–0 win over [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/45019 |title=Montpellier v.

====2010–11 season====
Ahead of the [[2010–11 Ligue 1|2010–11 season]], Lloris was nominated for the UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year award at the [[UEFA Club Football Awards]], but lost out on the award to [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]]-winning keeper [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]] of [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=814888&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5901 |title=Inter Milan players lead UEFA award nominations |date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/inters-champions-beat-allcomers-at-uefa-club-awards-2063126.html |title=Inter's champions beat all-comers at Uefa club awards |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Gordon |last=Tynan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season, Lloris performed well, despite conceding a career-high 40 goals in the league as Lyon failed to win the league for the third consecutive season. The frustrating season for the club and Lloris himself reached its zenith on 3 April 2011 following the club's 2–2 away draw with Lloris' former club Nice. Despite being up 2–0 heading into injury time, Lyon conceded two goals within two minutes of each other, an [[Éric Mouloungui]] penalty and a goal at the death from [[Renato Civelli]], allowing Nice to leave the match with a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53938 |title=Nice v.

On 5 March 2019, in the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] last-16 away tie against [[Borussia Dortmund]], Lloris made a number of crucial saves to kept a clean sheet, which ensured a 4–0 win on aggregate and progress to the club's second quarterfinal in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham/tottenham-analysis-hugo-lloris-becomes-pochettinos-human-wall-as-defensive-masterclass-paves-way-for-a4083646.html |title=Tottenham analysis: Hugo Lloris becomes Pochettino's human wall as defensive masterclass paves way for victory |first=Dan |last=Kilpatrick |date=5 March 2019 |work=Evening Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is his 100th clean sheet with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/05/borussia-dortmund-tottenham-champions-league-match-report |title=Harry Kane’s deadly artistry fires Spurs past Dortmund and into last eight |first=David |last=Hytner |date= 5 March 2019 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Hugo Lloris Euro 2012 v2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Lloris playing for France at UEFA Euro 2012.]]
Lloris has been active on the international front with [[France national football team|France]], first appearing with the [[France national under-18 football team|under-18 team]] making his debut on 11 March 2004 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Germany national under-18 football team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/112954.shtml |title=Un bon résultat nul face à l'Allemagne (1–1) |date=11 March 2004 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[French Football Federation]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later played with the [[France national under-19 football team|under-19 team]] and was part of the winning team at the [[2005 European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Lloris appeared in all five matches the team played in the competition. He made only five appearances with the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]], primarily because of his commitments to the senior team. On 11 October 2008, with the under-21 squad attempting to qualify for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], coach [[Erick Mombaerts]] called up Lloris to the team for their important two-legged playoff against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]], despite him having been called up to the senior team and the player having last played for the team in August 2007. Lloris honored the call up and started the second leg. With France seconds away from a spot in the tournament, because of the team's 1–1 draw in the first leg, Germany got a late goal from [[Benedikt Höwedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/fiche_joueur_new/match.php?id_match=41 |title=France v. Germany Match Report |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[French Football Federation]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1–0 loss eliminated France from the competition and also ended Lloris's under-21 career.

Lloris received his first call-up to the senior national team for France's 6 February 2008 match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. However, he instead played for [[France B national football team|the B team]] in their friendly match against the [[Congo DR national football team|Congo DR]], held the day before the Spain friendly. After receiving several more call ups in 2008, he finally earned his first cap on 19 November 2008 in a 0–0 draw with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. On 9 September 2009, Lloris received his first international [[Penalty card|red card]], against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], following a foul on [[Nikola Žigić]] in the penalty box, despite replays showing otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten-man France rouse to deny Serbia |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=302415/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708044400/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=302415/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |work=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris returned to the team on 14 October playing the entire 90 minutes in the team's 3–1 win over [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

Lloris was applauded by the media and players, alike, for his performance over two legs against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] that saw France earn a spot in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] finals. Former national team goalkeeper Grégory Coupet credited his performance as "phenomenal", while the French media described him as "Saint Lloris", which is a play on the nickname of Real Madrid counterpart [[Iker Casillas]], who was considered one of the top goalkeepers in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coupet hails "phenomenal" Lloris |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=699655&amp;cc=5901 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Les Bleus avec Saint Lloris et sans Gourcuff |url=http://fr.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1136808.html |work=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121045207/http://fr.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1136808.html |archivedate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saint Lloris, Priez pour nous |url=http://www.football365.fr/france/equipe-de-france/article_362596_france-eire-la-performance-des-bleus-Saint-Lloris-priez-pour-nous-.shtml |work=Football 365 |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2010, Lloris was named in Domenech's 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 World Cup, later being named to the final 23-man team and installed as first-choice goalkeeper. On 11 June 2010, Lloris made his [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals debut in the team's opening group stage match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], earning a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uruguay 0–0 France |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_02/default.stm |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris appeared in both of France's other group stage matches, against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and hosts [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]]. Against South Africa, Lloris committed a goalkeeping error which resulted in the opening goal for the hosts. He redeemed himself later in the match, however, by producing several saves to limit the South Africans' chances of progressing to the knockout rounds. France lost the match 2–1, which resulted in the hosts' elimination from the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2010: France v South Africa – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/22/world-cup-2010-france-south-africa-live |work=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kieran John Trippier''' (born 19 September 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Trippier started his career in the youth system at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] but failed to make the breakthrough to the first team, having two loans at [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. In 2011, he signed for Championship club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on a season-long loan which was made permanent in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He was named in the Championship [[PFA Team of the Year]] for two consecutive seasons in 2012–13 and 2013–14. In 2014, he secured promotion with Burnley to the Premier League as the team finished runners-up in the Championship. A year later, he signed for Tottenham for a £3.5 million fee.

Trippier also represented England at all levels from under-18 to under-21, featuring in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]] and [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. He made his senior international debut in June 2017 and was part of the team that reached the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

Mainly a [[central defender]], he can also play as a [[right back (association football)|right back]].

Alderweireld began his professional career at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], where he won honours including three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles. In 2013, he moved to [[Atlético Madrid]], where he won [[La Liga]] and reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] final in his first season.

A full international since 2009, Alderweireld has earned over 80 caps for Belgium and represented the country at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]]. On 22 February 2007, he signed his first professional contract, tying him to the club until 30 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ajax sign Toby Alderweireld|url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=61844|publisher=AFC Ajax|date=22 February 2007|accessdate=19 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023213133/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154814/contentid%3D61844|archivedate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the first team for the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]], but only made his first team debut on 18 January, in the 4–2 victory over [[N.E.C.

[[File:TobyAlderweireld.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Alderweireld with Ajax.]]
During the early stages of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld established himself in the first team and starting XI. He became first choice centre-back along with fellow Belgian [[Jan Vertonghen]] following the departure of former captain [[Thomas Vermaelen]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Wij hebben de beste selctie van Nederland'|last=Zwartkruis|first=Simon|work=Association football|date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Ajax coach [[Martin Jol]] praised the two defenders and kept faith in the duo after a string of good performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-en-alderweireld-dat-ziet-iedereen.aspx|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen en Alderweireld, dat ziet iedereen'|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coerts|first=Stefan |title =Ajax Coach Martin Jol Praises Jan Vertonghen And Toby Alderweireld | url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2009/09/30/1532572/ajax-coach-martin-jol-praises-jan-vertonghen-and-toby |work=Goal| date = 13 October 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 3–0 win against [[Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] on 4 September, he scored his first league goal for the club when he opened the scoring with a header from [[Luis Suárez]]'s corner-kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=271817|title=SC Heracles Almelo vs. Ajax Amsterdam - Football Match Report - August 30, 2009 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January, he scored a late equaliser in extra time during the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] [[2009–10 KNVB Cup#Quarter finals|quarter-final]] against NEC; [[Siem de Jong]] scored five minutes before the final whistle to steal a 3–2 win for Ajax. At the end of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld was named Ajax Talent of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/6550355/__Supporters_Ajax_eren_Suarez__.html |title=Supporters Ajax eren Suarez |work=De Telegraaf |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assured himself of a place in the Eredivisie giants' history books on 3 November 2011, heading in Ajax's 100th UEFA Champions League goal in the 2–1 Group G defeat by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1590396.html |title=Ajax's Alderweireld thrives on art of defending |publisher=UEFA by Berend Scholten|date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]], he scored a stunning 25-yard strike at the [[San Siro]] against [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in a 2–0 away win. He followed this spectacular goal with an even more impressive 32-yard strike against [[Feyenoord]] in a 2–0 home win.
In the [[2011–12 AFC Ajax season|2011–12 season]], Alderweireld made significant strides in his ability as a footballer, also forming a formidable partnership in the heart of the Ajax defensive with captain and fellow Belgian Jan Vertonghen. Alderweireld also showed some impressive offensive ability, scoring a remarkable goal against [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]].

On 5 August 2012, during the [[2012 Johan Cruyff Shield|Johan Cruyff Shield]] encounter against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], Alderweireld managed to score for Ajax in the 44th minute, bringing his club back within a goals difference going into halftime 2–1. Unfortunately, it was a match Ajax would lose 4–2, making it the third Johan Cruyff Shield which Alderweireld participated in and finished as runners-up. The following [[2012–13 AFC Ajax season|2012–13 season]], however, would be a successful one, marking the third year in a row that Alderweireld would play Champions League football, and also winning his third consecutive [[Eredivisie]] title for Ajax and 32nd overall, having played as a starting centre-back for Ajax in all three championship pursuits. Alderweireld scored a further three goals that season for Ajax, including two goals during the regular season against [[PEC Zwolle]] and [[FC Twente|Twente]], as well as scoring another goal in a 2–0 home victory against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], in the first leg of the Round of 32 in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#First leg|2012–13 UEFA Europa League]]. Having been drawn into a group with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and eventual runners-up [[Borussia Dortmund]] during its Champions League campaign, Ajax had entered into the Europa League at the knockout phase having secured third place in their group, but failed to advance, losing in the second leg match in Romania 4–2 on penalty kicks after extra time.

[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|Alderweireld with Ajax teammates in 2011.]]
With one more year remaining on his contract, Alderweireld opted not to extend his contract with Ajax, subsequently receiving plenty of interest during the off-season, with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] being mentioned as the most keen to sign the young defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.de/bayer-04-leverkusen/alderweireld-soll-kommen-kadlec-wechselt-zu-fenerbahce,3288,23318686.html |title=Alderweireld soll kommen Kadlec wechselt zu Fenerbahce |publisher=Express.de by Lars Werner.com|date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |title=Napoli wil tien miljoen euro betalen voor Toby Alderweireld |publisher=Nieuws.be by Voetbal4U.com |date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024075930/http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |archivedate=24 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlético Madrid===
On 2 September 2013, Alderweireld joined [[Atlético Madrid]] on a four-year contract for an estimated €7&amp;nbsp;million (£6.16&amp;nbsp;million) transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transfer deadline day: Atletico Madrid sign Toby Alderweireld and Josuha Guilavogui|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11838/8903655/transfer-deadline-day-atletico-madrid-sign-toby-alderweireld-and-josuha-guilavogui|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corrigan|first1=Dermot|title=Toby Alderweireld rejected Liverpool|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1543223/toby-alderweireld-rejected-liverpool-move-to-join-atletico-madrid|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 12 matches as the club won [[La Liga]]; on 11 May, he headed his only goal of the season, an equaliser in a 1–1 home draw with [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in the penultimate round of fixtures, ensuring that Atlético remained in the title race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlético Madrid 1–1 Málaga|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27301114|accessdate=1 September 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alderweireld played the final seven minutes and extra time of the [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|2014 Champions League final]] for Atlético in place of [[Filipe Luís]]; the team was beating [[Madrid Derby|city rival]] Real Madrid 1–0 when he entered the field of play, but Atlético eventually lost 1–4.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Madrid 4 Atlético Madrid 1|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27383593|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southampton (loan)====
Alderweireld was sent on a season-long loan to English [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 1 September 2014, with the option for Southampton to buy him at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agreement with Southampton for the loan of Alderweireld|url=http://en.clubatleticodemadrid.com/noticias/agreement-with-southampton-for-the-loan-of-alderweireld|publisher=[[Atlético Madrid]]|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton loan Toby Alderweireld from Atletico Madrid|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29025087|accessdate=2 September 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Southampton debut on 13 September, helping to keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 victory against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29090536 |title=Striker Graziano Pelle scored twice as Southampton overwhelmed a poor Newcastle side at St Mary's Stadium. |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=14 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, he scored his first goal for the club, Southampton's third in a 3–1 away win away to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] by heading [[James Ward-Prowse]]'s [[corner kick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emons|first1=Michael|title=Crystal Palace 1–3 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544147|accessdate=26 December 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton had a £6.8&amp;nbsp;million option to buy Alderweireld, but in July 2015 Atlético cancelled the clause for £1.5&amp;nbsp;million in order to sell to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tottenham agree £11.5m fee with Atletico Madrid for defender Toby Alderweireld|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3149989/Tottenham-agree-11-5m-fee-Atletico-Madrid-defender-Toby-Alderweireld.html|work=Mail online|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reports claimed that Atlético failed to exercise their buy-out in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Alan|title=Southampton ponder legal action if Toby Alderweireld joins Tottenham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/southampton-toby-alderweireld-atletico-madrid|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 8 July 2015, Alderweireld joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on a five-year contract which runs until the summer of 2020 at [[White Hart Lane]], despite Southampton threatening legal action over the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33442272 |title=Toby Alderweireld: Tottenham sign Atletico Madrid defender |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=9 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee was estimated to be £11.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toby Alderweireld signs for Tottenham for £11.5m on five-year deal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3153262/Toby-Alderweireld-signs-Tottenham-11-5m-five-year-deal.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490 |work=Daily Mail |date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Spurs, he was reunited with former Ajax teammates [[Christian Eriksen]] and Jan Vertonghen, who previously joined the north London side from Ajax.  On 30 July, Alderweireld made his club debut in the [[2015 MLS All-Star Game]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

[[File:Match Algérie vs Belgique, Coupe du Monde 2014, Brésil.jpg|thumb|Alderweireld playing at the [[2014 World Cup]] against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]]]
Alderweireld first represented Belgium at [[Belgium national youth football team|under-17 level]] in October 2005 and took part in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2006 UEFA U17 Championship]]. After the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]] concluded, he made his senior debut for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a friendly tournament. However, his full senior debut came three months later in a match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]].

In October 2009, he came on as a second-half substitute for [[Daniel Van Buyten]] in the 2–0 defeat to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]].

Alderweireld was called up to the [[Belgium national under-21 football team|Belgian U21 squad]] for the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification|2011 UEFA U21 Championship qualifier]] against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]] on 13 November 2009, with the match finishing 2–0 to Ukraine. He played [[right back (association football)|right back]] during the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 UEFA Euro qualification]] match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 7 September 2010.

On 13 May 2014, Alderweireld was named in the squad to go to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started in all five games of Belgium's tournament run, including its 1–0 defeat against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Belgium 2–1 Algeria|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127|accessdate=17 June 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jan Bert Lieve Vertonghen''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈjɑn vərˈtɔŋə(n)}}; born 24 April 1987) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. Mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], he can also play as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]].

He began his senior career at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2006 and totalled 220 games and 28 goals for them across all competitions, serving as their captain since 2011. He won two [[Eredivisie]] and two [[KNVB Cup]] titles during his time at the club, and in 2012 he was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]]. Vertonghen transferred to Tottenham in July 2012, and made the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in his first [[Premier League]] season, going on to make over 200 appearances for Spurs and winning their player of the year award in 2018.

Vertonghen made his international debut for Belgium in 2007 and his 111 caps (including [[Belgium national football team results – unofficial matches#2010s|three unofficial games]], according to FIFA rules) are the most in the history of the national team. He was part of Belgian squads that came fourth at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and reached the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] as well as third place at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Vertonghen was born in [[Sint-Niklaas]], Belgium, to Ria Mattheeuws and Paul Vertonghen.&lt;ref name=IndyDec2012&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/exclusive-interview-jan-vertonghen-spurred-on-by-tottenhams-fight-for-fourth-8418339.html |title=Exclusive interview: Jan Vertonghen spurred on by Tottenham's fight |last=Wallace |first=Sam |date=15 December 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.90min.com/posts/4304829-spurs-star-s-mother-admits-white-hart-lane-exit-could-be-close-due-to-homesickness-issues|title=Spurs Star's Mother Admits White Hart Lane Exit Could Be Close Due to 'Homesickness' Issues|last=Flavius|first=Kavan|date=21 December 2016|website=90min.com |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two brothers, Ward and Lode; both have played football.&lt;ref name=IndyDec2012/&gt;

==Club career==
===Ajax===
[[File:Shevchenko vertonghen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vertonghen marking [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]'s [[Andriy Shevchenko]] in 2010]]
After spending time at VK Tielrode and [[Germinal Beerschot]], Vertonghen moved to the Netherlands and signed a contract with the youth academy of [[Eredivisie]] side [[AFC Ajax]]. He began as a midfielder but then became a regular at centre-back for Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jan Vertonghen tevreden met positie bij Ajax|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/39673/jan-vertonghen-tevreden-met-positie-bij-ajax-list|work=Voetbal Centraal|date=12 November 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the [[Jong Ajax|reserves]], he became known for an incident in a [[2005–06 KNVB Cup|2006 KNVB Cup]] game against [[Cambuur Leeuwarden]], his first home game at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], where he scored a goal to put Ajax 3–0 up. He had attempted a back pass to the Cambuur goalkeeper while a teammate was receiving treatment but instead the ball went into the goal. Since it was  unintentional, Ajax allowed Cambuur to score a goal in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gatorade Cup: Young Ajax beat Cambuur in memorable game|url=http://www.ajaxusa.com/news/2005-2006/gatorade-cup-young-ajax-beat-cambuur-in-memorable-game.html|publisher=Ajax USA|date=20 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to RKC====
On 23 August 2006, Vertonghen made his first team debut in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. He made his first start and Eredivisie debut in a 6–0 win over [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] at the Amsterdam ArenA and would play another two matches for the first half of the season. After the winter break, he was sent on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to struggling [[RKC Waalwijk]] for the remainder of the season. At RKC, he would play 12 matches in which he scored three times, but he was unable to help the team avoid relegation to the [[Eerste Divisie]].

Vertonghen returned to Ajax for the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]], where he was tipped for stardom, but was unable to break through due to a severe injury and the presence of central defenders [[John Heitinga]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]]. [[Johan Cruyff]] had made no secret of his admiration for the left-footed youngster who can handle any left-sided position in defence and midfield, opting, on 26 September 2008, to extend his contract to 30 June 2013.

====Breakthrough at Ajax====
The [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]] was a breakthrough season for the young defender. After John Heitinga left for [[Atlético Madrid]], Vertonghen became Thomas Vermaelen's first-choice partner in central defence; the former started 23 of the 26 games he played in and scored four goals. On 28 September, he scored a rare double against [[Vitesse Arnhem|Vitesse]] in a 3–0 win. Although sustaining an injury from training during the week, he played in the match against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] on 24 January, billed as a "must-win" match by coach [[Marco van Basten]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preview: FC Groningen vs Ajax Amsterdam|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=249496&amp;cc=3888&amp;league=NED.1|work=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen was unfortunate enough to be sent off for two yellow cards as Ajax lost 1–0. He was out for a month after sustaining a hamstring injury in an away win on 1 March against [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]], but his return lasted only several games after his season was prematurely ended after aggravating another injury.

====Rising importance under Jol====
[[File:Vertonghen Stekelenburg.jpg|thumb|Vertonghen with [[Maarten Stekelenburg]].]]
Under new coach [[Martin Jol]], Vertonghen retained his place in the starting line-up for the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]]. Despite injuring his toe while on international duty against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] the previous week, he scored his first goal of the season, a free kick, in a 6–0 thrashing of [[NAC Breda]] on 13 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match Report: Ajax Amsterdam vs NAC Breda|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271828&amp;cc=3888&amp;league=NED.1|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], he and fellow Belgian [[Toby Alderweireld]] become the first choice centre-back pairing and soon became a firm fans' favourite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen is een echte Hollander'|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-is-een-echte-hollander.aspx|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Ajax's erratic form in the latter weeks leading up to the winter break, he turned in some strong performances and attracted the interest of a number of clubs, including [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but he played down the rumours, stating his intent to at least see out his contract with Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Jan Vertonghen in beeld bij FC Barcelona'|url=http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Barça.html|work=[[De Pers]]|date=17 February 2010|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224031455/http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Bar%C3%A7a.html|archivedate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guardiola estaría siguiendo a Vertonghen|url=http://www.sport.es/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=44&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=687794&amp;idseccio_PK=803|work=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|date=16 February 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the winter break, Ajax went on a nine-game unbeaten streak in the league, with Vertonghen playing a key role. Their run of six consecutive clean sheets was ended in a 4–1 home win over [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] when the visiting side were awarded a penalty. Vertonghen was linked with a move to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and later he was also linked with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], stating, "I've heard Milan Director [[Adriano Galliani]] talk about me after the Champions League match in [[San Siro]] and his words were very flattering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vertonghen linked to Milan|url=http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan|publisher=Goal-arena.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216043647/http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan/|archivedate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|Vertonghen (top right) [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing Ajax.]]
Vertonghen stated on numerous occasions late in the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] that he was considering leaving Ajax at the end of that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vertonghen weighing up move |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_6722248,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=4 February 2011|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ajax star targets Prem switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6921360,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, [[Frank de Boer]] confirmed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] boss [[Roberto Mancini]] was present at the [[2010-11 KNVB Cup|2011 KNVB Cup Final]] held on 7 May 2011, where Vertonghen's side lost 3–2 to [[FC Twente|Twente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6925317,00.html|title=City keep eye on Vertonghen|date=13 May 2011|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mancini was reportedly scouting Vertonghen to strengthen his side after they had qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] 2011–12 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/918003/man-city-scout-jan-vertonghen,-axel-witsel-and-kevin-de-bruyne?cc=5901|title=City scout Belgian trio|date=10 May 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakthrough under De Boer====
During the [[2011–12 Eredivisie]] season, Vertonghen emerged as one of Ajax's best players, demonstrating his versatility to cover multiple positions after Ajax had let several regular players out on long-term loans. After an impressive season, including a performance for which he was singled out for praise against Manchester United in the [[UEFA Europa League]] Round of 16, he was named the 2011–12 [[Dutch Footballer of the Year|Eredivisie Player of the Year]]. Named team captain by [[Frank de Boer]], he led his Ajax to their second title in a row, scoring eight goals in 31 league games, highlighting his attacking strengths. Also, for the second time, he dropped the Championship plate. "Now it falls on my toe&amp;nbsp;– this plate just does not like me," Vertonghen said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season review: Netherlands|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1800379.html#season+review+netherlands|publisher=by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
====2012–13 season====
Throughout the 2011–12 season, Vertonghen was linked with English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and publicly expressed his desire to make the move to [[White Hart Lane]] ahead of numerous other teams. A key factor in this was his desire to play as a centre-back, with Arsenal wanting to use him as a defensive midfielder. On 8 July 2012, Tottenham agreed a fee and terms for Vertonghen subject to a medical. On 12 July, Tottenham announced that they had officially completed the signing of Vertonghen, for an amount around 12 million Euros, after he successfully completed his medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Vertonghen completes Tottenham move from Ajax|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18761297|publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tottenham on the verge of completing transfer of Jan Vertonghen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/08/tottenham-signing-jan-vertonghen-ajax|publisher=The Guardian |date=8 July 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen took part in his first game as a Tottenham player in a 3–2 friendly win against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 14 July, then later scored his first goal for the club on 26 September in a 3–0 win against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in the third round of the [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645193 |title=Carlisle 0–3 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertonghen scored his first [[Premier League]] goal against Manchester United in a historic 2–3 win at [[Old Trafford]], although this was later ruled to be an own goal by [[Jonny Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/261615/report "Spurs end United hoodoo"] Skysport. 29 September 2012. Retrieved 29 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored in the league for Tottenham on 16 December, the only goal of the game, in a win at White Hart Lane against [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/premier-league/2012-2013/tottenham-hotspur-swansea-city-515473.html "Premier League&amp;nbsp;– Vertonghen strike sinks Swansea"] UK Yahoo. 16 December 2012. Retrieved 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen then scored a brace in a losing effort against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 10 March. He was named [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for March 2013, making himself the second Belgian and the 12th Spurs player to win the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen and Moyes win Barclays awards|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/apr/david-moyes-and-jan-vertonghen-win-barclays-march-awards.html|work=Barclays Premier League|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729045920/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/apr/david-moyes-and-jan-vertonghen-win-barclays-march-awards.html|archivedate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 2013, Vertonghen was sent-off against [[FC Basel|Basel]] during Tottenham's [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League#Quarter-finals|Europa League quarter-final second leg]].

====2014–15 season====
[[File:Chelsea 3 Spurs 0 (15953303611).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Vertonghen (right) playing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2014.]]
At the start of the [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 season]], Vertonghen appeared to be out of favour with new manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]]. The Argentine gave Vertonghen limited games, preferring [[Younès Kaboul]] and [[Federico Fazio]]. However, Kaboul lost his place to Vertonghen, who formed an effective partnership with Fazio. Together, the pair, over the span of 15 games, celebrated 11 wins and only suffered one loss. Vertonghen helped Spurs to reach the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup Final]] and started the game on 1 March 2015, but Tottenham lost to [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] 2–0.&lt;ref name=2015LC&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Chelsea 2–0 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31572594 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
Vertonghen was joined in defence by former Ajax teammate and compatriot Alderweireld at the start of the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]]. Over the first ten games of the season, Vertonghen and Alderweireld played ten out of the opening ten games together, with Spurs suffering only one loss during the span.  In late January 2016, he damaged his medial knee-ligament and did not play for 11 weeks.&lt;ref name="injury"/&gt; He returned in the home match against Manchester United on 10 April 2016, which finished in a 3–0 win, the first home league win for Tottenham against Manchester United since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/660766/Tottenham-Jan-Vertonghen-Manchester-United-Premier-League-news-rumours |title=Tottenham star: Why Manchester United win was easy |first=James |last= Gray|date=13 April 2016 |work=Sunday Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; His partnership with Alderweireld in the defence was recognised as being crucial for the club which had the joint-lowest number of goals conceded in the Premier League that season.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/features/the-big-interview/the-big-interview-with-jan-vertonghen-120416/ |title=THE Big Interview- Jan Vertonghen|date= 12 April 2016  |work=Tottenham Hotspur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Vertonghen Belgium National Team vs USA 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 2013]]
Vertonghen made his international debut at the under-21 level in 2006 and played in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 UEFA U21 Championships]].

On 2 June 2007, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|national team]] in a 2–1 loss against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. He was also selected for the 2008 Olympics and played in every match as the Belgians unexpectedly took fourth place.

In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], he began to establish himself as a regular, initially at centre-back as former Ajax teammate [[Thomas Vermaelen]]'s partner. He scored the opening goal, also his first ever international goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen: "Moeten dringend eens maturiteit tonen"|url=http://belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|language=Dutch|work=Belgiumsoccer.be|date=13 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133000/http://www.belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|archivedate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an August 2009 friendly against the Czech Republic that ended in a 3–1 loss. On 7 September 2009, in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualifying away match]] against Spain, he injured his toe and had to be stretchered off and substituted in the 29th minute. The match ended bad as well; a 5–0 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen twee weken uit de strijd|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/4777976/__Teen_zit_Vertonghen_dwars__.html|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|date=7 September 2009|accessdate= 13 September 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now he usually plays as leftback as Vermaelen and [[Vincent Kompany]] are the preferred pairing in central defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L’équipe-type prend forme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/sports/football/article/543707/l-equipe-type-prend-forme.html|work=[[La Libre Belgique]]|date=19 November 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was back in the starting eleven for the friendly against Hungary, a 3–0 win&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=België wint oefenpot tegen Hongarije: 3–0|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/voetbal-binnenland/aid878871/belgie-wint-oefenpot-tegen-hongarije-3-0.aspx|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=14 November 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1–0 loss to Croatia the following March.

On 13 May 2014, Vertonghen was named in [[2014 FIFA World Cup squads#Belgium|Belgium's squad]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's opening match against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], the African side was awarded a penalty after Vertonghen pulled down [[Sofiane Feghouli]] and received a yellow card. Feghouli scored for Algeria from the penalty spot,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127 Felini Inspires Belgium to Comeback Win&amp;nbsp;– BBC Sport online], Accessed 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but Belgium came back to win 2–1. He was then replaced by Thomas Vermaelen in the starting line-up for the second match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 22 June.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242|title=Brazil v Russia|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 31 minutes, however, Vermaelen was taken off with an injury and replaced by Vertonghen.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In the final group match, Vertonghen [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team and scored the winning goal as Belgium beat [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285474|title=South Korea 0–1 Belgium|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 2014–15 season, Vertonghen knocked a child unconscious with a misplaced shot during a training session with the Belgian squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/jan-vertonghen-knocks-girl-unconscious-after-a-stray-pass-while-training-for-belgium-9708768.html|title=Jan Vertonghen knocks girl unconscious after a stray pass while training for Belgium|work=The Independent|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he injured two ligaments in his ankle in an accident while training before the quarter-final against Wales during [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and as a result missed the match that Belgium lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/30/jan-vertonghen-belgium-euro-2016-quarter-final-wales |title=Jan Vertonghen ruled out of Euro 2016 after tearing ankle ligaments |date=30 June 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven years to the day on from his international début, against the same opposition (Portugal) Vertonghen won his 100th [[cap (sport)|cap]] (the first in Belgian history), which was presented to him by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These sports stars proved that their mums are the real superstars|first=Jagroop|last=Shinbt|date=4 June 2018|accessdate=4 June 2018|work=bbc.co.uk/bbcthree|publisher=BBC Three|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/615c42f0-39be-43fb-8235-9b7ee8e9ae83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, Vertonghen initiated the scoring in Belgium’s second-half comeback from a 0–2 deficit against Japan, heading from 20 yards out to the far post in a 3–2 comeback victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live blog|date=2 July 2018|accessdate=2 July 2018|work=fifa.com|publisher=FIFA|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331551/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Winks has represented England up to senior level. Before this, he was eligible to represent [[Spain national football team|Spain]] as well as England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3167719/tottenhams-harry-winks-i-consider-myself-english-and-i-want-to-play-for-england |title=Spurs' Harry Winks: 'I consider myself English and I want to play for England' |first=Dan |last=Kilpatrick |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20 squad]] for the Mercedes-Benz Elite Cup in Germany in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2015/sep/under-20s-squad-named-for-trip-to-germany-300915 |title=England Under-20s squad named for Mercedes Elite Cup in Germany |first=Nicholas |last=Veevers |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winks made his [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] debut on 14 November 2016 where he started in [[England national under-21 football team|England]]'s friendly 3–2 defeat to [[France national under-21 football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37896448 |title=France-U21 3–2 England-U21 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2017, Winks received his first call up to the [[England national football team|senior England squad]], for their [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pitt-Brooke |first1=Jack |last2=Delaney |first2=Miguel |title=England call up Harry Winks to replace injured Fabian Delph and Phil Jones |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-call-up-harry-winks-to-squad-to-face-slovenia-a7979581.html |accessdate=2 October 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut when starting in England's 1–0 away win over Lithuania, which was the team's final match in their successful 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. Phil McNulty of BBC Sport stated that, on the night, Winks was "England's best performer. Neat and tidy and almost scored. Eye-catching among so much mediocrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Lithuania 0–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41457291 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 October 2017 |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winks missed the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] due to injury, but returned to the England squad in the [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League]] away match against Spain. He helped England to a 3–2 win, the first competitive home defeat for Spain since 2003 and England's first win in Spain in 31 years, in what was judged a "self-assured" performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/10/15/harry-winksproves-has-exactly-kind-quality-england-side-needs/ |title=Harry Winks proves he has exactly the kind of quality this England side needs – sharp, self-assured and aggressive |first=Jason |last=Burt |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has said "When we talk about midfielders – because you like to use Spanish midfielders like [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta|(Andres) Iniesta]] – he's like this type of player",&lt;ref name = "Winks Wonder"&gt;{{cite news |title=WINKS WONDER: Harry Winks ‘like Barcelona legends Andres Iniesta and Xavi’ but Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham midfielder must focus on football |publisher=Talksport |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |url=https://talksport.com/football/422282/tottenham-spurs-winks-iniesta-xavi-injury/}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing Winks as "completely different to our other midfielders like [[Victor Wanyama]], [[Eric Dier]], [[Mousa Dembélé (Belgian footballer)|Mousa Dembélé]] and [[Moussa Sissoko]]. He has qualities to add to the team that are completely different".&lt;ref name="unlock" /&gt; ''[[Talksport]]'' remarked that following his breakthrough for club and country, Winks was "seen as a potential difference-maker for the Three Lions due to his very individual skill set", with Winks earning comparisons with foreign midfielders rather than his English contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Winks Wonder" /&gt; 

Ex-England and Spurs midfielder [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] said in September 2018 that the England team should be built around Winks, citing his performance for Tottenham against Real Madrid in the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage]] as evidence: "The one who I think has got the capability, more than anyone else I have seen, is [Harry] Winks. What he showed in that game in Madrid, in both games when he was fit and at it, was a confidence and an ability to play. To see the passes, to get his foot in and be disciplined and mix that mix of midfield talent that you need [...] for me, Winks is one of the best I've seen when he's at it – in terms of his all-round ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TALENT: Tottenham Hotspur starlet Harry Winks can solve England's midfield problem, says former Liverpool man Danny Murphy |first=Joe |last=Coleman |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=Talksport |url=https://talksport.com/football/420735/tottenham-hotspur-harry-winks-can-solve-englands-midfield-liverpool-danny-murphy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ESPN FC]]''{{'}}s Ben Pearce opined in 2018: "England are still missing a [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]] [...] Those wondering who could possibly fill the void have obviously forgotten Winks, who excels at keeping possession with quick, short passes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Winks ready to revitalise creaking Spurs midfield after long injury layoff |date=13 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |first=Ben |last=Pearce |website=ESPN FC |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/tottenham-hotspur/367/blog/post/3631601/harry-winks-ready-to-revitalise-creaking-spurs-midfield-after-long-injury-layoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane's former youth coach [[Alex Inglethorpe]] has said of him:&lt;blockquote&gt;When he first came into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved slightly awkwardly, he was a bit cumbersome. But look closer, he had a lot of ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|holding midfielder]].&lt;ref name=jim/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While a teenager, Kane initially struggled in Tottenham's academy, as partially due to his date of birth in July, he was not as physically developed as other players, nor was he as quick. However, he gained the respect of coaches with his technique and desire for self-improvement.&lt;ref name=jim&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jim |title=Harry Kane's incredible journey from Arsenal reject to Tottenham hero |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11335368/Harry-Kanes-incredible-journey-from-Arsenal-reject-to-Tottenham-hero.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quoted=1|quote=He seems to have that natural ability to get goals. He's also young, fresh and his attitude appears to be very, very good. What I like about him, is that he is willing to run in behind defenders, as well as go short. When he gets opportunities he inveariably [''sic''] takes them. He wants to get his shot away very quickly, which is good to see.

Former Tottenham manager [[David Pleat]] described Kane as an "old-fashioned traditional centre-forward".&lt;ref name=mcnulty/&gt; [[Clive Allen]], who coached him at Tottenham, stated that "one thing I'd say about him, which unfortunately you don't say about a lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game. He loves football, he loves playing, he loves scoring goals".&lt;ref name=mcnulty/&gt; His former Tottenham under-21 coach [[Les Ferdinand]] likened Kane's movement to their former forward Teddy Sheringham, and the power and accuracy of his shots to Alan Shearer.&lt;ref name=jim/&gt;

Kane's style of play has been compared to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann, a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=Kevin |title=Harry Kane flattered by Jurgen Klinsmann comparisons |url=http://www.espnfc.com/tottenham-hotspur/story/2281527/harry-kane-flattered-by-jurgen-klinsmann-comparisons |accessdate=8 February 2015 |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Football Association]] chairman [[Greg Dyke]] named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; Shearer said that month that the three best strikers playing in the league were Kane, Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero.&lt;ref name=shearer/&gt;

After Tottenham's victory over Chelsea in January 2015, blogger Chris Miller wrote, "Nobody thought he was the guy who was going to give that performance against Chelsea".&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; In February 2015, [[BBC Sport]] wrote that Kane was best as a lone striker, with his "hold-up play and close control" making him apt in other positions as well.&lt;ref name=mcnulty&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Harry Kane: England's next number nine? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31395579 |accessdate=11 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, ''[[Match of the Day]]'' pundit [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] said that the England team should be built around Kane, stating, "I'm struggling to see a weakness in the lad's game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Kane: Build England around striker – Murphy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31204958 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN FC|ESPN]] reporter Michael Cox stated that "Kane was initially considered a pure goal scorer, he's actually a good all-round player, often playing as an attacking midfielder", pointing out that during the 2018 FIFA World Cup "Kane's contributions in deeper positions were outstanding, his back-to-goal work as impressive as ever".&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;

'''Erik Manuel Lamela''' ({{IPA-es|ˈeɾik laˈmela}}; born 4 March 1992) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for English {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

He began his career at [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and in 2011 transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for an initial €12 million. After two [[Serie A]] seasons he joined Tottenham for a fee of £25.8 million. A full international since 2011, he was part of the Argentine squad which finished as runners-up at the [[2015 Copa América]].

==Early life==
After he had joined River Plate as a seven-year old, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] reportedly offered Lamela and his family £100,000 a year, as well as a house and employment for his parents, to move to the city of [[Barcelona]], in a similar deal to the one that saw [[Lionel Messi]] move to Spain as a youngster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/425727/WATCH-Tottenham-s-Erik-Lamela-spurned-Barcelona-as-a-child |title=Tottenham's Erik Lamela spurned Barcelona as a child |work=Express |publisher=Express |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a ''[[Trans World Sport]]'' film crew travelled to Argentina to interview a 12-year-old Lamela who was already making headlines after scoring 120 goals for River Plate's youth side the previous season. In the video, Lamela declares his wish to follow in the footsteps of [[Diego Maradona]] and win a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ric0xTz5g2A |title=12-year-old Erik Lamela on Trans World Sport |work=YouTube |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===River Plate===
Lamela made his first team debut for [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] on 14 June 2009 in a game against [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] for the [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Clausura|2009 Clausura tournament]]. He entered the field on the 80th minute, substituting [[Robert Mario Flores|Robert Flores]]. Lamela scored his first goal for River on 5 December 2010 in a match against [[Club Atlético Colón|Colón]] for the [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Apertura|Apertura tournament]]. He scored his second goal against [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] in the final fixture of that Apertura, helping River win the match 4–2.

The midfielder was a regular starter for River during the [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season]], playing 34 games and scoring four goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinesoccer.com/player.cfm?id=lmla |title=Profile |publisher=Argentine Soccer |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped his team to finish in an overall sixth place that would have qualified them for the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana]]. Due to the relegation format of the Argentine Primera that accounts a team's last three seasons, however, River was relegated after losing a playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]].

===Roma===
====2011–12 season====
[[File:Oscar Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.JPG|thumb|right|Lamela (r.) playing for Roma against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in August 2013]]

On 6 August 2011, Lamela joined Italian club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] of [[Serie A]] for a fee of €12 million, plus €2 million in bonuses, which was activated after his 20th club appearance.&lt;ref name=Romacontract&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/operazioni_di_mercato/2011-08-06_acquisizione_a_titolo_definitivo_dei_diritti_alle_prestazioni_sportive_del_calciatore_erik_manuel_lamela.pdf |title=Acquisizione a titolo definitivo dei diritti alle prestazioni sportive del calciatore Erik Manuel Lamela |publisher=asroma.it |accessdate=6 August 2011 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma also paid an additional €3.2 million to Orel B.V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/comunicati_finanziari/2012_31_10_as_relazione_finanziaria_annuale_al_30_giugno_2012.pdf |title=Relazione Finanziaria annuale al 30 giugno 2012 |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2013 |publisher=AS Roma |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; — plus 10% added value if the player was later sold above €12 million — and €3.06 million in the form of taxes to the Government of Argentina. Lamela signed a 5-year contract worth €1.8 million in gross in the first season, but would gradually increase by €350,000 on 1 July 2012 (to €2.15M), 2014 (€2.5M) and 2015 (€2.85M).&lt;ref name=Romacontract/&gt; On 23 October 2011, he scored his first goal in Serie A against [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/327134/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828112219/http://espnfc.com/en/report/327134/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=AS Roma 1–0 Palermo |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he scored goals against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/326903/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828113445/http://espnfc.com/en/report/326903/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=Lecce 4–2 AS Roma |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novara Calcio|Novara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/326912/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828113418/http://espnfc.com/en/report/326912/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=Europe close in on AS Roma |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.C.

====2012–13 season====
Lamela began the [[2012–13 Serie A|2012–13 season]] well, his first goal of the season coming against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 16 September 2012. Lamela hit a superb patch of form in October and early November, scoring seven goals in six games, including a brace against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in a 3–2 home defeat and goals against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], and [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]. He also scored a goal in the [[Derby della Capitale]] against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. After almost a month out with an ankle ligament injury, he returned to the field and scored a brace against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in a 4–2 victory on 22 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/88222/roma-vs-ac-milan/report? |title=Roma 4–2 AC Milan: Ragged Rossoneri leave it too late against 10-man Giallorossi |publisher=Goal.com |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamela went on to score 15 times in 33 games, putting him joint-fifth in Serie A and second to striker [[Dani Osvaldo|Pablo Osvaldo]] (16 goals) at Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/stats/scorers?league=ita.1&amp;year=2012 |title=Italian Serie A Goal Scoring Leaders – 2012–13 |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamela's and Roma's season, however, ended in heartache with defeat to [[Rome]] rivals Lazio in the [[2012–13 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] final, coupled with finishing sixth in Serie A, meaning that Roma would not play [[UEFA|European]] football for the second consecutive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/106534/roma-vs-lazio/report? |title=Roma 0–1 Lazio: Biancocelesti edge dour derby to claim Coppa Italia |publisher=Goal.com |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 30 August 2013, [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] completed the transfer of Lamela from Roma for a deal worth an initial £25.8&amp;nbsp;million, plus up to £4.2&amp;nbsp;million in bonus payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/373444642198405121 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Twitter |accessdate=30 August 2013 |title=We are delighted to announce that we've reached agreement with AS Roma for the transfer of Erik Lamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23903926 |title=Erik Lamela: Tottenham confirm the signing of Roma forward |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee for Lamela made him the most expensive player in the club's history, breaking the two previous records that had been set earlier in the transfer window, first for [[Paulinho (footballer)|Paulinho]] and then [[Roberto Soldado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2404513/Tottenham-seal-30m-Erik-Lamela-AS-Roma.html |title=Tottenham seal £30m Lamela deal to complete hat-trick of club record transfers |publisher=Daily Mail |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
On 1 September, Lamela made his debut for Tottenham as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1–0 [[North London derby]] loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23831033 |title=Arsenal 1–0 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |first=Alistair |last=Magowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, he made his first start for Tottenham against [[Tromsø IL]] in the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], assisting [[Jermain Defoe]] for Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at [[White Hart Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/10321158/Tottenham-Hotspur-3-Tromso-0-match-report.html |title=Tottenham Hotspur 3 Tromso 0: match report |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, he assisted Paulinho's stoppage-time winning goal after appearing as a substitute in Tottenham's 1–0 win at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24098608 |title=Cardiff 0–1 Tottenham |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Mugubi Wanyama''' ({{IPA-all|wɑˈɲɑːmɑ|[[Kenyan English]]:|Victor Mugubi Wanyama.ogg}}; born 25 June 1991) is a Kenyan professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and captains the [[Kenya national football team|Kenyan national team]].&lt;ref name="Captain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/23267053 |title=Celtic's Victor Wanyama has joined Southampton, say Kenyans |work=BBC Sport |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama became the first ever Kenyan player to score in the [[UEFA Champions League]] when he scored the first goal in [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s 2–1 win over [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on 7 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/224/652/3/ |title=Wanyama: Saints' sights on Europe |work=FIFA |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2013, Wanyama moved to Premier League club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for £12.5 million making him the most expensive player sold by a Scottish club, surpassing the £9.5 million Russian club [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] paid for [[Aiden McGeady]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague=england-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/213/511/7/index.html |title=Southampton in record swoop for Wanyama |work=FIFA |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has earned over 50 caps for the [[Kenya national football team|Kenyan national team]] since making his international debut in May 2007 at the age of 15.

== Early life ==
Wanyama attended Kamukunji High School, which fields a successful football team. Upon leaving High School, he also played with JMJ Academy for three years during which time he also joined [[Kenyan Premier League]] clubs [[Nairobi City Stars]] and [[AFC Leopards]].&lt;ref name=Cement&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/InsidePage.php?id=2000000305&amp;cid=38&amp;story=Mugabe%20wants%20to%20cement%20position%20in%20Belgium%20club Mugabe wants to cement position in Belgium club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132405/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/InsidePage.php?id=2000000305&amp;cid=38&amp;story=Mugabe%20wants%20to%20cement%20position%20in%20Belgium%20club |date=4 March 2016 }} Standard Digital, 5 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he joined [[Allsvenskan]] club [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]] but after the departure of his brother [[McDonald Mariga]] to [[Serie A]] side [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in 2008, Wanyama returned to Kenya.

== Club career ==

=== Beerschot AC ===
After a successful trial, Wanyama signed for [[K. Beerschot AC|Beerschot AC]] on a four-year contract in summer 2008. He made his debut in a League match at the end of the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|2008–09 season]]. In September 2009, he was fined €100 and given a three-match suspension for a violent tackle on [[Matías Suárez]] of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=44838 Wanyama suspendu trois matchs (Wanyama suspended three games)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AV6dTJkR?url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=44838 |date=7 September 2012 }} Footgoal, 29 September 2009 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2010 [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] attempted to sign Wanyama but Beerschot did not allow him to leave. Russian club [[CSKA Moscow]] also attempted to sign him, but they failed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=57331 Wanyama va rester au Germinal Beerschot (Wanyama stays with Germinal Beerschot)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819044505/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=57331 |date=19 August 2010 }} Footgoal, 16 April 2010 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama scored his first goal for Beerschot on 11 December 2010, a 77th-minute equaliser against Westerlo. In April 2011, he received another three match suspension after video evidence showed he had elbowed Brecht Dejaeghere of [[K.V. Kortrijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=67175 Wanyama poursuivi (Wanyama continued)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AV6iiuF7?url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=67175 |date=7 September 2012 }} Footgoal, 18 April 2011 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much speculation and a previous breakdown in talks, on 11 July 2013, Wanyama signed for [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for a fee claimed to be £12.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=  Victor Wanyama: Southampton sign Celtic midfielder for £12.5m  | url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22969633| publisher=BBC Sport| date=11 July 2013 | accessdate= 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the first Kenyan to ever play in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wanyama makes Saints switch | url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/wanyama-makes-saints-switch-909448.aspx | publisher=Southampton FC | date= 11 July 2013| accessdate= 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama said: {{centred pull quote|Southampton is a good club and it has good players, so I just want to train hard and work hard to be a part of the starting XI. We'll see where that will take me. It feels great and I am happy to be here. There were other options, but Southampton is a club with ambitions so I chose to come here. I'm very grateful to be here and I'm looking forward to playing in the Premier League.}}

He made his debut on 17 August 2013, in 1–0 away win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Brom 0–1 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644676 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wanyama made 24 appearances in his first season, but injuries hindered his efforts to make much of an impact in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Wanyama desperate for Saints to end with record breaking tally|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/11160909.Victor_Wanyama_desperate_for_Saints_to_end_with_record_breaking_tally/|publisher=Daily Echo|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Armand Vorm''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmiʃɛl ˈvɔrm}}; born 20 October 1983) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] footballer who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Vorm began his professional career at [[FC Utrecht]] in 2005, spending his first season on loan at [[FC Den Bosch]]. He transferred to [[Swansea City]] in 2011, playing three [[Premier League]] seasons and winning the [[2013 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 2013]]. Vorm joined Tottenham for £3.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2014.

A full international for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] since 2009, Vorm was included in their squads for two World Cups and [[Euro 2012]], as back-up in all three tournaments.

==Club career==

===FC Utrecht===
Born in [[IJsselstein]] to a Dutch mother and a [[Suriname]]se father,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/10422121/I-love-this-type-of-game-no-matter-how-intense-it-is-says-Swanseas-Michel-Vorm-ahead-of-derby-against-Cardiff.html|title = 'I love this type of game, no matter how intense it is,' says Swansea's Michel Vorm ahead of derby against Cardiff|website = The Daily Telegraph|access-date = 6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorm began his career at [[FC Utrecht]]. In order to gain more experience, he spent the 2005–06 season on loan to [[FC Den Bosch]].  He made his debut on 12 August 2005 against [[FC Emmen]], the first of 35 appearances that season.

In August 2006, Vorm made his debut for Utrecht against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]]. Although he joined FC Utrecht as the third-choice goalkeeper, behind [[Franck Grandel]] and [[Joost Terol]], his pre-season performances impressed manager [[Foeke Booy]], and saw him promoted to first choice 'keeper at the start of the league season. During this first season Vorm played 33 out of 34 matches, and his position as number one at the club remained unchallenged thereafter. Vorm missed a handful matches during the 2007–08 season due to knee and shoulder injuries. He left Utrecht at the start of the 2011–12 season, having played 136 matches in the [[Eredivisie]].

===Swansea City===
In August 2011, Vorm joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a fee of around £1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/07/swansea-michel-vorm-utrecht|title=Swansea agree fee for Dutch international goalkeeper Michel Vorm|date=7 August 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He took the vacant number 1 shirt and made his debut for the club against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 15 August 2011 in a 4–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=318034|title=Manchester City vs. Swansea City – Football Match Report – August 15, 2011 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he conceded four goals, he also made eleven saves&amp;nbsp;– more than any other Premier League goalkeeper, in a single match, in the whole of the 2011–12 season. In his second match for Swansea against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], on 20 August, Vorm saved a 72nd-minute penalty from [[Ben Watson (footballer born July 1985)|Ben Watson]], to give Swansea their first ever point in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14514711.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Swansea 0–0 Wigan | date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2011, Vorm arguably saved Swansea from defeat against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and earned them the draw at [[Anfield]] by pulling off two outstanding saves to earn the [[clean sheet]].

During his first season with Swansea he helped keep 13 clean sheets in 37 league appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11kicks.com/Teams/Swansea_City_1/Stats |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323153459/http://www.11kicks.com/Teams/Swansea_City_1/Stats |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances were so impressive that he won three awards at the club's end-of-season dinner&amp;nbsp;– Supporters' Player of the Year, Players' Player and the Away Player awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vorm's triple trophy swoop|url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/awards-night-207835.aspx|publisher=[[Swansea City A.F.C.]]|date=10 May 2012}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match ended 1–0 to Cardiff City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Cardiff 1–0 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24690406|accessdate=6 July 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===

On 23 July 2014, Vorm announced via Dutch radio that he would sign for [[Tottenham Hotspur]] to compete with [[Hugo Lloris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/69/transfer-zone/2014/07/23/4977923/vorm-confirms-tottenham-switch?ICID=HP_BN_11|title=Vorm Confirms Tottenham Switch|date=23 July 2014|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed on a four-year deal costing Spurs £3.5&amp;nbsp;million after three years at Swansea, joining on the same day as Swansea's [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1993)|Ben Davies]] made the same move and [[Gylfi Sigurðsson]] was exchanged as part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2703258/Ben-Davies-Michel-Vorm-sign-Tottenham-Swansea-Gylfi-Sigurdsson-heads-Wales-deal.html|title=Ben Davies and Michel Vorm join Spurs from Swansea as Gylfi Sigurdsson heads to Wales as part of deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was disputed by Utrecht, who complained to FIFA that they were contractually due 30% of the fee received by Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City: Utrecht report club to Fifa over Vorm fee|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28701743|accessdate=11 August 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA rejected Utrecht's claim, and the case was heard in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michel Vorm: Swansea due in court over Tottenham transfer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35438556|accessdate=29 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut for Tottenham on 24 September, in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at home against [[Nottingham Forest]]. Despite conceding first to [[Jorge Grant]], Tottenham won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham 3–1 Nottm Forest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233056|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorm featured again in the next round on 29 October, keeping his first clean sheet for the club as Tottenham defeated [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham 2–0 Brighton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29718447|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later he played his first [[UEFA Europa League]] match for Tottenham, a 2–1 win away to [[Asteras Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abraham|first1=Timothy|title=Asteras Tripolis 1–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29919621|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorm's first league appearance for Tottenham came on 21 March 2015, after Lloris went off injured in the fourth minute of a home match against [[Leicester City]]. Tottenham won 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Tottenham 4–3 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31883462|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April he made his first league start, a goalless draw against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Pete|title=Burnley 0–0 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32103945|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2016, Vorm made his first appearance of the 2016–17 season for Tottenham Hotspur in a 1–1 draw with Everton at Goodison Park, in which he replaced the injured Lloris after 35 minutes.

==International career==
In 2006, he was a member of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad that won the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006]] in Portugal.

Vorm played his first match for the senior national team on 14 November 2008, replacing [[Henk Timmer (footballer)|Henk Timmer]] at half time in a 3–1 home friendly win, conceding to [[Kim Källström]] within four minutes of coming on. He made his first start on 5 September 2009 in a friendly home match against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (3–0 win), followed up four days later by an impressive performance at [[Hampden Park]] during the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]&amp;nbsp;– Netherlands, a match won 1–0 by the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/09/world-cup-scotland-holland]&amp;nbsp;– Holland end luckless Scotland's World Cup hopes&amp;nbsp;– 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8240464.stm]&amp;nbsp;– BBC Sports Scotland 0–1 Netherlands &amp;nbsp;– 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
At Hampden Park, this was Vorm's first competitive match ever outside the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/08/scotland-holland-maarten-stekelenburg-goalkeeper]&amp;nbsp;– Novice Dutch goalkeeper offers Scots glimmer of hope&amp;nbsp;– 8 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup===
Vorm was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 | agency=Agence France-Presse|date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager [[Bert van Marwijk]] announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the start of the competition he was allowed to fly back to the Netherlands. During the World Cup, Vorm's girlfriend Daisy delivered a son, Jaivy Waylon. The Dutch goalkeeper returned home for two days following his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1049/Oranje/article/detail/490374/2010/06/14/Zoontje-voor-doelman-Vorm-Jaivy-Waylon.dhtml |title=Zoontje voor doelman Vorm: Jaivy Waylon |work=Algemeen Dagblad|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/%28/actueel/rtlboulevard/nieuws/articleview/%29/components/actueel/rtlboulevard/2010/06_juni/entertainment/Op_babybezoek_bij_michel_vorm.xml |title=Op babybezoek bij Oranje-keeper Michel Vorm |publisher=RTL.nl| date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010| language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euro 2012===
Vorm was included in the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad for [[Euro 2012]]. [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] was [[Bert van Marwijk]]'s first choice in goal, playing all three games as the nation exited in the group stage.

===2014 World Cup===
For the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], coach [[Louis van Gaal]] included Vorm in the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad, alongside young Ajax goalkeeper [[Jasper Cillessen]] who was first choice in goal and [[Tim Krul]]. Despite his{{clarify|date=January 2019}} penalty-saving ability, Van Gaal opted to replace Cillessen with Krul in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] during the quarter-final match against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Vorm came on for Cillessen in injury time of the 3–0 third place play-off win against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Brasília]], thus ensuring that all 23 Dutch squad members played at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28173517|title=Brazil 0–3 Netherlands|date=12 July 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moussa Sissoko''' (born 16 August 1989) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He plays as a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box midfielder]] in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre of the pitch]], and is capable of playing in either a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|holding midfield role]], or even as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]].

Sissoko began his football career playing for local youth clubs in the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]], such as Espérance Aulnay and [[Red Star F.C.|AS Red Star 93]]. In 2002, he moved south to join professional club [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. Sissoko spent four years in the club's youth academy and made his professional debut in the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]]. He also played in the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time. In the following season, Sissoko earned award nominations for his performances and also helped Toulouse qualify for the newly created [[UEFA Europa League]].

Sissoko was a [[France national youth football team|French youth international]] and played at all levels he was eligible for. In August 2009, he was called up to the [[France national football team|senior team]] for the first time and made his senior international debut in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/matches/round=250471/match=300041092/report.html | title = France v. Faroe Islands Match Report | date = 10 October 2009 | accessdate = 5 June 2010 | publisher = [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first international start four days later in a qualifier against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

==Early life and career==

Sissoko was born in [[Le Blanc-Mesnil]], Seine-Saint-Denis, to [[Mali]]an parents. His father is a [[construction worker]] and his mother is a [[housewife]].&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2010/12/24/976615-Moussa-Sissoko-le-grand-Bleu.html | title = Moussa Sissoko, le grand Bleu | date = 24 December 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = La Depeche | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko is the eldest of four children, with three younger sisters. He was attracted to football at a very young age, stating, "I quickly realised that football could lead me to have a better life".&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"/&gt; At the age of six, Sissoko joined the youth academy of Espérance Aulnay, based in nearby [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]], a suburb in northeastern Paris. He trained three times a week at the club under the supervision of trainer Adama Dieye, who now serves as a correspondent for the club's [[futsal]] team. Sissoko describes Dieye as an important mentor in his development stating "I am here today because of him".&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"/&gt; In July 1999, Sissoko moved to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] to join [[Red Star F.C.|AS Red Star 93]]. Sissoko spent two years at the club and was teammates with [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] [[midfielder]] [[Yannis Salibur]]. In September 2001, he returned to Aulnay for a further two years developing before seeking a move to a professional club.

==Club career==
===Toulouse===
====2003–2008====
In July 2003, Sissoko made the trek down south to the [[Haute-Garonne]] [[Departments of France|department]] to sign with professional club [[Toulouse FC]]. He signed an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract and was placed in the club's under-14 team. Sissoko spent three years developing in the club's youth academy alongside future teammates [[Cheikh M'Bengue]] and [[Étienne Capoue]] before earning a call up to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of [[Football in France|French football]], ahead of the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]]. Sissoko appeared in 18 matches during the amateur season, quickly becoming one of the club's most sought after prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.stat2foot.com/twclubs/tfc20607.htm | title = Football Toulouse Effectif CFA 2006/2007 | date =  | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = Stat 2 Foot | language = French | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132608/http://www.stat2foot.com/twclubs/tfc20607.htm | archive-date = 16 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to signing his professional contract with Toulouse, he garnered interest from English clubs [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name ="interview_sissoko" /&gt;

Midway through the 2006–07 season, Sissoko signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Toulouse until June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=15909 | title = Je veux d’abord faire mes preuves en France | date = 25 January 2007 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = Mali Web | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently promoted to the club's senior team in the ensuing summer and assigned the number 22 shirt by manager [[Elie Baup]]. Sissoko made his professional debut on 4 August 2007, appearing as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat to [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51306 | title = Valenciennes v.

Sissoko replaced [[Albin Ebondo]] in the 83rd minute and received a yellow card in the final minute. Toulouse lost the first leg 1–0 and the tie 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301269/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120708025812/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301269/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 8 July 2012 | title = Liverpool spoil Toulouse's big day | date = 15 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301285/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120715154854/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301285/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 July 2012 | title = Liverpool complete safe passage | date = 28 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko scored his first professional goal on 1 September 2007 in a 2–0 victory over [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], scoring in [[injury time]] after coming on as a substitute two minutes previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51357 | title = Toulouse v.

On 6 January 2008, Sissoko scored his second goal of the season against [[Paris FC|Paris]] in the [[Coupe de France]]. Toulouse surprisingly lost the match to the semi-professional club 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/52163 | title = Toulouse v.

Following the season, on 25 July 2008, Sissoko signed a contract extension with the club until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.toulouse7.com/2008/07/25/foot-emana-part-au-betis-seville-sissoko-prolonge/ | title = Emana part au Betis Seville, Sissoko prolonge | date = 25 July 2008 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = Toulouse 7 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–2013====
[[File:Moussa Sissoko 2008-10-04.jpg|thumb|right|Sissoko in [[Toulouse FC]] colours, 2008]]
Following the departure of Emana to Spain, Casanova put Sissoko into the box-to-box midfielder role ahead of the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]] to accommodate emerging defensive midfielder [[Étienne Capoue]] into the starting lineup, as well as [[Étienne Didot]], who arrived from [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. The move allowed Sissoko to retain his defensive duties, but also showcase his attacking skills. He began the season featuring primarily as a substitute under Casanova, but by December, Sissoko had become a regular in the starting eleven. On 24 January 2009, he scored his first goal of the season against amateur [[Alsace|Alsatian]] club FCE Schirrhein in an 8–0 thrashing in the Coupe de France. It was a memorable goal with Sissoko running nearly the entire pitch with the ball at his feet, eluding several Schirrhein players, before finishing at the six-yard box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doOaGiQrM00 | title = but de sissoko TFC Toulouse | date =  | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/53073 | title = Schirrhein v.

He scored his first goal of the league campaign on 7 February in a 2–0 victory over [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/52428 | title = Toulouse v.

With the under-18 team, Sissoko appeared in all eight matches the team contested as France nearly went undefeated losing their only match 1–0 to [[Germany national under-18 football team|Germany]] in [[Kehl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/366025.shtml | title = La France s'incline (0–1) | date = 15 March 2007 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his increased playing time domestically with Toulouse, Sissoko missed the 2007 edition of the Sendai Cup in Japan and numerous other under-19 tournaments and only featured in [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification|2008 UEFA U-19 Championship qualification matches]].

Sissoko earned his first call up to the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] for their [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 9 September 2008.

The team's ultimate failure to qualify for the competition effectively ended Sissoko's under-21 career, though he still appeared in friendly matches against [[Turkey national under-21 football team|Turkey]], [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark]], and [[Russia national under-21 football team|Russia]] in 2010 as he was still eligible to participate in non-competitive matches.

On 3 August 2009, Sissoko earned his first call up to the [[France national football team|senior team]] for a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tfc.info/news/node/1013376 | title = Gignac et Sissoko chez les Bleus | date = 3 August 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[Toulouse FC]] | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko did not make his debut in the match. On 6 October, he was named to the senior squad for the second time for the team's final World Cup qualification matches against the Faroe Islands and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Sissoko earned his first [[Cap (association football)|cap]] in the match against the Faroe Islands appearing as a substitute for [[Jérémy Toulalan]] in the second half.

Sissoko was involved in France's run to the final of the [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016 UEFA European Championship]], making four starts in the tournament. He put in an inspired performance in the final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], having two shots saved in the 1–0 extra time defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000451/match=2017907/postmatch/report/index.html#portugal+beat+france+final |title=Portugal spoil France's party with extra-time win |work=UEFA |first=Tom |last=Kell |date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando Javier Llorente Torres''' ({{IPA-es|feɾˈnando ʎoˈɾente ˈtorːes}}; born 26 February 1985), nicknamed ''El Rey León'' ("[[The Lion King]]" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/rey-leon-area/dasftb/20100526dasdaiftb_40/Tes|title=Un 'rey león' en el área|trans-title=A 'lion king' in the box|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|first=P. P.|last=San Martín|language=Spanish|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]].

He started his career with [[Athletic Bilbao]], working his way through the various youth ranks and, after making his first team debut in 2005, becoming one of the most important offensive players for the club in the following decade. He scored 29 goals in all competitions in the [[2011–12 Athletic Bilbao season|2011–12 season]], and was described as a "Bilbao legend".&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-on-high-alert-after-striker-fernando-llorente-rejects-new-deal-with-athletic-bilbao-8026359.html|title=Chelsea on high alert after striker Fernando Llorente rejects new deal with Athletic Bilbao|newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/201510/08/pichichi-reune-goleadores-rojiblancos-20151008210636.html|title=Los discípulos de Pichichi|trans-title=Pichichi's disciples|newspaper=[[El Correo]]|first=Javier|last=Ortiz de Lazcano|language=Spanish|date=9 October 2015|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2013, winning the [[Serie A]] title twice during his two-year spell there. Subsequently, he spent the [[2015–16 La Liga|2015–16 campaign]] back in Spain with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], then competed in the [[Premier League]] with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and Tottenham Hotspur.

A [[Spain national football team|Spain international]] since late 2008, Llorente was a member of the squads which won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].

==Early years==
Born in [[Pamplona]], Llorente grew up in the municipality of [[Rincón de Soto]] in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]].&lt;ref name="navarra"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diariodenavarra.es/actualidad/noticia.asp?not=2009040901275783&amp;dia=20090409&amp;seccion=deportes&amp;seccion2=osasunaFutbol|title=Llorente nació en la capital navarra "de casualidad"|trans-title=Llorente was born in Navarre capital "by chance"|newspaper=Diario de Navarra|language=Spanish|date=9 April 2009|accessdate=12 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011342/http://www.diariodenavarra.es/actualidad/noticia.asp?not=2009040901275783&amp;dia=20090409&amp;seccion=deportes&amp;seccion2=osasunaFutbol|archivedate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/2005/01/18/pagina-24/1532732/pdf.html|title=Fue todo tan rápido que ni me lo creía|trans-title=Everything was so fast i could not believe it|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|first=Alberto|last=García|language=Spanish|date=18 January 2005|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Athletic Bilbao]]'s youth system in 1996 at the age of 11, [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|being eligible]] through his [[Navarre]]se roots.

==Club career==

===Athletic Bilbao===
[[File:Fernando Llorente contra el Hércules en el estadio José Rico Pérez.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Llorente in action for Athletic against [[Hércules CF|Hércules]], when he scored the first goal of [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11]]]]
Llorente spent several seasons in the various junior levels of the club, playing alongside [[Fernando Amorebieta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/2012-03-01/amistoso-entre-llorente-amorebieta-20120301.html|title=Amistoso entre Llorente y Amorebieta|trans-title=Friendly between Llorente and Amorebieta|newspaper=El Correo|first=J.|last=Gómez Peña|language=Spanish|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving to their farm team [[CD Basconia]] in [[Tercera División]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=1056&amp;idi=2|title=Staff restructuring|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually improved, leading to promotion to [[Bilbao Athletic]] – Athletic's reserves – in [[Segunda División B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=1956&amp;idi=2|title=Incorporations of Bilbao Athletic|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=1 June 2004|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring four goals for the B's in the first half of the season, Llorente was rewarded with a contract extension until June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=2523&amp;idi=2|title=Fernando Llorente's contract extension|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=11 December 2004|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 2005, he made his first-team and [[La Liga]] debut in a 1–1 home draw against [[RCD Espanyol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=2648&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 1-Espanyol 1: No luck|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=16 January 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, in a [[Copa del Rey]] match against [[UD Lanzarote]], he scored a [[hat-trick]] in a [[2004–05 Copa del Rey|6–0 victory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=2664&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 6-Lanzarote 0: It advanced|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=20 January 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to feature in all but five of the nineteen remaining league games, scoring three goals, and also played in four domestic cup matches and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] [[2004–05 UEFA Cup|round of 32 clash]] against [[FK Austria Wien]].

Before [[2005–06 La Liga|2005–06]], Llorente exchanged his squad number of 32 for the number 9 jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=3369&amp;idi=2|title=Numbers for the 2005–2006 season|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=29 July 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on the opening day, a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[Local derby|derby]] 3–0 win over [[Real Sociedad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=3466&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 3 Real Sociedad 0: An excellent start to the season|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=28 August 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, throughout the campaign, found goals hard to come by. This could be partly attributed to a series of injuries including a [[knee]] strain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=3639&amp;idi=2|title=Urzaiz fit to play, Prieto, Guerrero and Llorente sidelined|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gastroenteritis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=3905&amp;idi=2|title=Several players injured as a result of the match|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=8 January 2006|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a muscle injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=4253&amp;idi=2|title=Llorente and Lacruz: Muscle overload|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=24 April 2006|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season with just four goals, two in the league and as many in the Cup, both against [[CE L'Hospitalet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=3724&amp;idi=2|title=L'Hospitalet 1-Athletic Club 3: To the Round of 16|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=9 November 2005|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2006, Llorente signed a new contract until June 2011, which included a buy-out clause of between [[Euro|€]]30 and 50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=4416&amp;idi=2|title=Llorente's renewal: press conference|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started [[2006–07 La Liga|the season]] as arguably the club's fourth-choice striker, behind [[Aritz Aduriz]], [[Joseba Etxeberria]] and veteran [[Ismael Urzaiz]]. The team's poor form and lack of goals led to coach [[Félix Sarriugarte]] rotating the players, allowing Llorente to force his way back into the side; he ended the campaign with only two goals in 23 matches, although he did score an important one in the closing minutes of a 1–1 draw at [[Valencia CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/203868?cc=5739|title=Valencia 1–1 Athletic Bilbao|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=11 November 2006|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08]], Llorente scored six goals in as many pre-season matches, and another against [[CD Numancia]] in the ''Caja Duero'' Trophy. His form led to him becoming Athletic's first-choice forward, and although he started the campaign poorly, he ended it with a total of 11 league goals as the side finished in mid-table. His tally included four goals in two games against Valencia, both impressive wins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=6217&amp;idi=2|title=Valencia 0 – Athletic Club 3: A perfect match|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=2 December 2007|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=6731&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 5 Valencia 1: A perfect night|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=20 April 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further strikes against [[FC Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=6417&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 1-FC Barcelona 1: A proud point|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=27 January 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Villarreal CF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=6518&amp;idi=2|title=Athletic Club 1-Villarreal 2: From better to worse|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=6494&amp;idi=2|title=Atlético de Madrid 1-Athletic Club 2: A step in the right direction|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=17 February 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09]], Llorente was confident of a successful season. "I know that I am capable of scoring goals and having a good year and I want to start this term in the same form that I ended the last one in" he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingsmallorca.com/news/?p=324|title=Aduriz move surprised everyone – Llorente|publisher=All Things Mallorca|date=2 September 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003045327/http://www.allthingsmallorca.com/news/?p=324|archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the team's modest start he scored 14 league goals – a career-best – with another four in [[2008–09 Copa del Rey|the Cup]], helping his team reach [[2009 Copa del Rey Final|the final]] against Barcelona (a 1–4 loss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2009/05/13/futbol/copa_rey/1242251735.html|title=El Barça se corona por aplastamiento|trans-title=Barça crowned through crushing|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|first=Delfín|last=Melero|language=Spanish|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]], Llorente again reached double figures. He led all scorers in the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] for a long period with eight goals, and added fourteen in the league as Athletic eventually finished in eighth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2010/02/08/actualidad/1265617316_850215.html|title=Llorente, el goleador silencioso|trans-title=Llorente, the silent scorer|newspaper=[[El País]]|first=Eduardo|last=Rodrigálvarez|language=Spanish|date=8 February 2010|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sevilla.abc.es/deportes/orgullodenervion/noticias/sevilla-fc/fernando-llorente-casi-20-goles-de-media-por-temporada-89388-1440672433.html|title=Fernando Llorente: casi 20 goles de media por temporada|trans-title=Fernando Llorente: an average of nearly 20 goals per season|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|language=Spanish|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fernando Llorente CAMP NOU 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Llorente playing against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (2012)]]
On 28 August 2010, Llorente scored the first goal of the [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 campaign]], in a 1–0 win at [[Hércules CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/301988?cc=5739|title=Llorente lifts Bilbao|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=28 August 2010|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form continued in the next ten league fixtures as he found the net seven times, eventually finishing the season with 18 goals (19 overall) as Athletic qualified for the Europa League.

==International career==
[[Image:Spain vs England.jpg|thumb|300px|Llorente (right, with number 16, marked by [[Peter Crouch]]) moments before his first goal for [[Spain national football team|Spain]]]]
Llorente represented [[Spain national under-20 football team|Spain]] at the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], his five goals winning him the silver boot as the competition's second highest scorer.&lt;ref name="Silver Boot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=4085&amp;idi=2|title=Silver Boot|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=2 March 2006|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Cap (sport)|capped]] at [[Spain national under-18 football team|under-18]] and [[Spain national under-19 football team|under-19]] levels.

On 14 November 2008, [[Spain national football team|senior national team]] manager [[Vicente del Bosque]] called Llorente up for a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Chile national football team|Chile]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=2&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=7340&amp;idi=2|title=The Spanish national team: Call up|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=14 November 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was brought on as a substitute in the 72nd minute of the 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/11/19/sports/SOC-Spain-Chile.php|title=Spain beats Chile 3–0 to cap historic season|newspaper=[[The New York Times International Edition|International Herald Tribune]]|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in the 64th minute of a 2–0 friendly win over [[England national football team|England]] on 11 February 2009, after coming off the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7874902.stm|title=Spain 2–0 England|first=Mandeep|last=Sanghera|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring 14 goals for Athletic in 2008–09, Llorente was named by del Bosque in his 23-man squad for the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]].

Llorente was not selected during the 2009–10 season, as del Bosque favoured [[Álvaro Negredo]]. He was, however, selected for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa as third-choice striker, where he played in one match for the eventual champions, the last thirty minutes of the 1–0 [[Single-elimination tournament|round of 16]] win over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/spain-vs-portugal/218253|title=Spain send Portugal packing|publisher=Sky Sports|first=Ben|last=Collins|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also represented the [[Basque Country national football team|Basque Country national team]] five times.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Alli is widely considered one of the best young [[midfielder]]s of his generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/dele-alli-marco-asensio-10-most-valuable-u-23-midfielders/10 |title=10 most valuable U-23 midfielders in the world |first=Ashwin |last=Hanagudu |date=17 May 2017 |website=Sportskeeda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/1284/Anderlecht/article/detail/3141964/2017/04/25/Tielemans-meest-beslissende-middenvelder-in-Europa.dhtml |title=Tielemans meest beslissende middenvelder in Europa |first=Dimitri |last=Eeckhaut |date=25 May 2017 |website=HLN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2017/05/12/35447392/alli-is-a-freak-and-up-there-with-gerrard-and-scholes-says |title=The 21-year-old is playing well beyond his years whilst sharing the limelight at White Hart Lane alongside fellow England team-mate Harry Kane |date=12 May 2017 |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has won PFA Young Player of the Year twice in a row while only 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/dele-alli-named-pfa-young-player-of-the-year-for-second-season-running-a3521696.html |title=Dele Alli named PFA Young Player of the Year for second season running |first=Alex |last=Young |date=23 April 2017 |newspaper=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also considered an all-round player who can play effectively as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/10843214/why-dele-alli-deserves-to-win-the-pfa-young-player-of-the-year-award |title=Why Dele Alli deserves to win the PFA Young Player of the Year award |first=Gerard |last=Brand |date=25 April 2017 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mauricio Pochettino]]: "In the box, he looks like a striker, and outside the box, he plays like a midfielder."

Alli watches the best players to try to learn from their style of play, including [[Lionel Messi]], [[Xabi Alonso]], [[Andrés Iniesta]] and [[Xavi]] as well as his idol Steven Gerrard.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; His teammate [[Harry Winks]] described Alli as being like [[Fernandinho (footballer)|Fernandinho]], but Dele Alli has described his own playing style as "a cross between Gerrard and [[Yaya Touré]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2014/sep/dele-alli-hoping-to-emulate-gerrard |title=Deli Alli hopes to emulate Gerrard |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli has been widely accused of diving and has received bookings for simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Nick |title=Dele Alli warned by Mauricio Pochettino to cut out diving after booking for simulation in Spurs' rout of Huddersfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dele-alli-dive-warned-mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-spurs-huddersfield-harry-kane-goals-a7975751.html |accessdate=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alan Shearer Places Responsibility on Mauricio Pochettino to Stop Dele Alli Diving |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/02/11/alan-shearer-places-responsibility-mauricio-pochettino-stop-dele-alli-diving |accessdate=22 February 2018 |website=Sports Illustrated |date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Alan |title=Dele Alli back in spotlight after 'blatant cheating' |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/the-game/dele-alli-back-in-spotlight-after-blatant-cheating-xcf35m03m |accessdate=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The Times |date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Winter |first1=Henry |title=Diving Dele Alli must shun the dark arts |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/alli-is-a-cheat-and-is-in-danger-of-alienating-himself-l0b3tthhz |accessdate=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pitt-Brooke |first1=Jack |title=Arsene Wenger believes English players 'may be the masters' of diving ahead of Arsenal's trip to Tottenham |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/tottenham-spurs-vs-arsenal-north-london-derby-nld-arsene-wenger-pochettino-diving-a8200156.html |accessdate=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Alli is considered the world's most expensive midfielder from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/239/en/ |title=Updated transfer valuations: Mbappé takes the lead |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=5 November 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Alli was born in [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|22066|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Nigerian father Kehinde&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theeagleonline.com.ng/dele-alli-may-become-yoruba-king-fashanu/ |title=Dele Alli may become Yoruba king – Fashanu |publisher=Eagle News |date=2 May 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English mother Denise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Graeme |last1=Culliford |first2=Tracey |last2=Kandohla |date=6 April 2016 |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/80787/i-gave-dele-alli-away-at-13-to-save-him-from-gangs-and-allow-him-to-follow-his-football-dream/ |title=I gave Dele Alli away at 13 to save him from gangs and allow him to follow his football dream |newspaper=The Sun |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kehinde moved to the United States a week after Alli's birth.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jim |title=The Dele Alli story: How a tough upbringing inspired the rise of a Premier League superstar |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/03/05/the-dele-alli-story-how-a-tough-upbringing-inspired-the-rise-of/ |accessdate=12 August 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli was initially brought up by his mother, who suffered from alcohol problems.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"/&gt; At the age of nine, he moved to Nigeria with his father, where he spent two years in an [[international school]] before returning to Milton Keynes to live with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Hill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dele-allis-estranged-parents-issue-9918748 |title=Dele Alli's estranged parents' tearful plea for England star to let them back into his life |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |date=5 February 2018 |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli went to [[Stantonbury Campus]]&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/mk-dons/11107393/Liverpool-and-Bayern-Munich-target-Dele-Alli-dances-to-his-own-tune-at-MK-Dons.html |title=Liverpool and Bayern Munich target Dele Alli dances to his own tune at MK Dons |date=18 September 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Radcliffe School]] in [[Wolverton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hytner |first1=David |title=Dele Alli: England's fearless street footballer who can take Euro 2016 by storm |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/09/dele-alli-england-euro-2016 |accessdate=5 May 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 13, he moved into the family home of Alan and Sally Hickford, parents of another young footballer with MK Dons and whom he refers to as his "adoptive parents" although he was never legally adopted by them.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/dele-allis-mother-gave-tottenham-7151123 |title=Dele Alli's biological mother tells emotional story of Spurs star's childhood |first=Aaron |last=Flanagan |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, Alli elected to stop wearing his surname on his match shirts because he felt no connection with the Alli family name, instead opting for "Dele".&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

Alli was a Liverpool fan growing up with [[Steven Gerrard]] his childhood idol,&lt;ref name="BBC Sport 19Sep2014"/&gt; and saw Gerrard and [[Frank Lampard]] as good role models on how they act as professionals.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; He is also a fan of [[British hip hop]] music, which led rapper [[Cadet (rapper)|Cadet]] to release a single referencing the footballer, "[[Advice (song)|Advice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/54381/cadet-and-deno-driz/|title="Advice" by Cadet - 2018|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career in Middelfart and Odense===
Born in [[Middelfart]], Denmark, Eriksen followed in his father Thomas' footsteps when he started playing football in the academy of local side, [[Middelfart G&amp;BK|Middelfart]].&lt;ref name=makings&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/christian-eriksen-making-of-denmark-tottenham |title=The making of Christian Eriksen: from the start he was a ‘wow’ footballer |publisher=The Guardian |last=Ames |first=Nick |date=15 June 2018 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen's father was also one of the coaches at the time and in 2004 they helped the youth side finish unbeaten in the local youth championship for the third time in a period of four years.&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; The following year, he joined [[Odense Boldklub]] who competed in the Danish youth championships and within a year had helped the club to an age-group title. It was at OB that Eriksen first began showing signs of his technical ability, with his dribbling and free-kick techniques lauded by then-coach, Tonny Hermansen.&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; His form at youth level attracted the attention of a number of major European clubs, including the likes [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FC Barcelona kigger på OB-talent |date=4 April 2008 |newspaper=[[B.T. (tabloid)|BT]] |url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/fc-barcelona-kigger-paa-ob-talent |first=Niels |last=Hansen |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen ultimately underwent trials with both clubs as well as [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], but finally decided to move to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], stating, "My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=139277 |title='De eerste stap moest niet te groot zijn, Ajax was fantastische optie' |publisher=Voetbalzone |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EriksenAjax3.jpg|thumb|Eriksen represented [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] between 2008 and 2013 during which time he helped the club to four [[Eredivisie]] titles.]]

On 17 October 2008, Eriksen signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with [[Amsterdam]]-based club, [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].&lt;ref name=uefastarlet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=762604.html |title=Danish starlet Eriksen opts for Ajax |publisher=UEFA |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transfer fee]] received by OB was estimated at €1&amp;nbsp;million (£847,199) while Middelfart also received a sum of €35 000 which they later used to construct a football pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/34596/_Wenger_eager_to_sign_up_Ajax_starlet_after_Bergkamps_endorsemsent_.aspx |title=Wenger eager to sign up Ajax starlet after Bergkamp's endorsemsent |website=Sport.co.uk |first=Nigel |last=Brown |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226101000/http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/34596/_Wenger_eager_to_sign_up_Ajax_starlet_after_Bergkamps_endorsemsent_.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; He worked his way through the youth teams at Ajax and was promoted to the [[first team]] squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt.&lt;ref name=uefafaith/&gt; Later that month, he made his first team debut in a 1–1 [[Eredivisie]] with [[NAC Breda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eriksen fik debut i Ajax |language=Danish |date=17 January 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2010 |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]] |url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/2010/01/17/160629.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://talksport.com/uncategorized/100325/christian-eriksen-player-every-club-wants-ten-things-you-need-know/ |title=Christian Eriksen – The player every club wants: Ten things you need to know |publisher=talkSport |last=Mannion |first=Damian |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Ajax on 25 March in a 6–0 win over [[Go Ahead Eagles]] in the [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] and extended his contract with the club the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfvoetbal.nl/Overige/181292/Supertalent-Eriksen-tot-2014-bij-Ajax |title=Supertalent Eriksen tot 2014 bij Ajax |publisher=ELF Voetbal |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=11 March 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May, he played in the second match of the final of the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|2009–10 Dutch Cup]] as Ajax beat [[Feyenoord]] 4–1, prevailing 6–1 on aggregate.&lt;ref name=2010cup&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=291558&amp;cc=5739 |title=Report: Feyenoord Rotterdam vs Ajax Amsterdam&amp;nbsp;– Dutch Cup |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508052455/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=291558&amp;cc=5739 |archivedate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his first professional season with the club, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark.&lt;ref name=SW/&gt;&lt;ref name=debut/&gt; Eriksen's form throughout the campaign earned praise from manager [[Martin Jol]] who compared him to former youth products [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Rafael van der Vaart]] as well as Danish legend, [[Michael Laudrup]] for his reading of the game in the traditional [[Playmaker|"number 10" role]].&lt;ref name=uefafaith&gt;{{cite news |title=Eriksen puts faith in Ajax way by Berend Scholten |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1459745.html#eriksen+puts+faith+ajax |publisher=UEFA |date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imscouting.com/global-news-article/Christian-Eriksen-The-new-Laudrup/7979/ |title=Christian Eriksen: The new Laudrup |publisher=IMScouting |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–2013: Breakthrough years====

Eriksen took the number eight jersey ahead of the following campaign and began the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] well, scoring his first Ajax league goal on 29 August 2010 in an away victory over [[De Graafschap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/13/AJAX/article/detail/305683/2010/07/16/Ajax-maakt-rugnummers-bekend.dhtml |title=Ajax maakt rugnummers bekend |newspaper=Het Parool |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/08/29/netherlands/eredivisie/bv-de-graafschap/afc-ajax/941442/ |title=De Graafschap vs. Ajax |website=Soccerway |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next few months, he scored his first home goal at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], in a 3–0 Cup victory over [[SC Veendam|BV Veendam]], and his first European goal, in a 3–0 [[UEFA Europa League]] win over [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/11/11/netherlands/knvb-beker/afc-ajax/veendam-1894/1038712/ |title=Ajax vs. Veendam |website=Soccerway |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000129/match=2003770/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Ruthless Ajax make Anderlecht pay the penalty |publisher=UEFA |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the milestone goals, Eriksen was also named [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Danish Football Association's award|Danish Talent of the Year]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Landsholdet/2010/12/07/215702.htm |title=Christian Eriksen er Årets Talent 2010 |publisher=Danmarks Radio |first=Rikke |last=Darfelt |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His growing capabilities as the team's playmaker saw him become an undisputed starter in the side and he helped Ajax to their first [[2010–11 Eredivisie|Eredivisie title]] in seven years. At the end of the season he was named Ajax's [[List of AFC Ajax records and statistics#AFC Ajax prize winners|Talent of the Year]].&lt;ref name=ajaxtalent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajax.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuws-artikel/Stekelenburg-Ajacied-van-het-Jaar.htm |title=Stekelenburg Ajacied van het Jaar, Christian Eriksen Talent van het Jaar |publisher=AFC Ajax |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form throughout the campaign also earned him the [[Dutch Football Talent of the Year]] award which saw him become only the second Danish player to win the award since [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] in 1996. [[Johan Cruyff]], whose panel selected Eriksen for the award, described Eriksen as a typical product of the Danish school and added to previous comparisons between him and [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and Michael Laudrup."&lt;ref name=talentned&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1634341.html#janssen+voted+eredivisies+best |title=Janssen named Netherlands' finest |publisher=UEFA |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |first=Berend |last=Scholten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EriksenAjax2.jpg|thumb|Eriksen (right) playing for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in 2011.]]

On 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the [[UEFA Champions League]] when Ajax beat [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] 2–0 in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1642569#slide3 |title=Christian Eriksen to Liverpool: Tracking the Evolution of the Rumour |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Greene |first=Laura |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the return fixture the following month, he provided assists to teammates [[Gregory van der Wiel]] and [[Siem de Jong]] as Ajax recorded a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/matches/round=2000263/match=2007632/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Stylish Ajax eliminate Dinamo |publisher=UEFA |date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later he was named [[Danish Football Player of the Year]] in recognition of his role in helping Ajax to the league title the season before and in Denmark's successful [[UEFA Euro 2012]] qualification campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=den/news/newsid=1714527.html |title=Eriksen and Pedersen honoured in Denmark |publisher=UEFA |first=Peter |last=Bruun |date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen continued to impress for Ajax and his strong contribution, both in terms of goal and assist returns, helped the club to a second consecutive league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2601/features/2012/05/11/3095096/goalcoms-eredivisie-team-of-the-season-vertonghen-eriksen |title=Goal.com's Eredivisie Team of the Season: Vertonghen, Eriksen &amp; Dost make the cut |publisher=Goal |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriksen and Ajax repeated the feat in the [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13 season]] following which he opted not to renew his contract with the club.

Eriksen played a key-role during the nation's qualification campaign during which time he scored eight goals to earn Denmark a play-off against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/great-dane-eriksen-is-danger-forireland-372f7gngj |title=Christian Eriksen is danger for Ireland |publisher=The Times |last=Hawkey |first=Ian |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leg of the play-off ended in a 0–0 home draw before Eriksen netted a [[hat-trick]] in [[Dublin]]'s [[Aviva Stadium]] in a 5–1 win to earn Denmark a spot at the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41884909 |title=Republic of Ireland 1–5 Denmark (agg: 1–5) |last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen's treble took his tally to 11 goals for the qualification campaign, bettered only by Poland's [[Robert Lewandowski]] (16) and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (15) in Europe, and earned the praise of national team manager [[Åge Hareide]] who stated that Eriksen was one of the top 10 players in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/17248/11127219/tottenhams-christian-eriksen-one-of-the-worlds-top-10-players-says-denmark-boss-age-hareide |title=Tottenham's Christian Eriksen one of the world's top 10 players, says Denmark boss Age Hareide |publisher=Sky Sports |date=15 November 2017 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark's opening match at the tournament, Eriksen assisted [[Yussuf Poulsen]] for the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] before scoring his first goal for the tournament in the 1–1 draw with [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/christian-eriksen-denmark-world-cup-2018-thomas-delaney-australia-a8411006.html |title=World Cup 2018: ‘Great things happen’ when you play alongside Christian Eriksen, Denmark’s shining star |publisher=The Independent |last=Miller |first=Nick |date=22 June 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark ultimately progressed from their [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group C|group]] after which they were drawn with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|Round of 16]]. There they were defeated after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], with Eriksen being one of three players to have his spot-kick saved by Croatia goalkeeper [[Danijel Subašić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/01/croatia-luka-modric-christian-eriksen-denmark-world-cup |title=Croatia’s Luka Modric fluffs big line but still prevails in duel with Eriksen |publisher=The Guardian |last=Pender |first=Kieran |date=1 July 2018 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serge Alain Stephane Aurier''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁʒ oʁje|lang}}; born 24 December 1992) is an Ivorian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast national team]].

Aurier moved to France as a child and played for [[RC Lens|Lens]], [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], winning 11 major trophies with the last. He totalled 169 appearances in [[Ligue 1]] and was twice named in the competition's [[Trophées UNFP du football|Team of the Year]]. In 2017, he joined Tottenham for a fee of around £23&amp;nbsp;million.

He made his international debut for the Ivory Coast in 2013 and has earned over 40 caps. He represented the nation at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and two [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments, winning the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015 edition]].

==Club career==
===Lens===
Aurier played for various youth teams and academies before he was accepted to join Villepinte. Aurier then joined [[RC Lens|Lens]] in [[Ligue 1]], where this started his professional footballing career.&lt;ref name="SergiAurier1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sergi Aurier: le sue partite meglio di una birra d'estate|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/il-volto-nuovo/cinque-milioni-per-un-terzino-full-back-difesa-attacco-forza-e-solidita-serge-aurier-le-sue-partite-meglio-di-una-birra-d-estate-294432|publisher=Tutto Mercato Web|date=14 September 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Aurier, who was then thirteen at the time, had to leave his friends and family as a result of joining Lens.&lt;ref name="SergeAurier2"/&gt; There, Aurier was assigned to the club's reserve team and at a point, was the club's captain in the reserve team.&lt;ref name="SergeAurier2"/&gt; In June 2009, Aurier signed his first professional contract with Lens.&lt;ref name="SergeAurier2"/&gt;

Aurier made his professional debut for the club in a 1–0 win over [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] on 22 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lens leave it late|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/138433/report|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier was given another opportunity in the [[2009–10 Coupe de la Ligue#Round of 16|Round of 16 of Coupe de la Ligue]], a 2–1 loss against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RC Lens 1 – 2 FC Lorient|url=http://www.ligue1.com/coupeLigue/feuille_match/53523|publisher=Ligue 1|date=13 January 2010|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon sustained a shoulder injury that left him out for two or three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boukari out 2 à 3 semaines|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Boukari-out-2-a-3-semaines/94806|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Aurier went on to make five appearance for Lens in his first season.

Aurier's second season saw him break into the first-team, and although he went on to make 26 appearances in [[2010–11 Ligue 1|2010–11]], the club was relegated to [[Ligue 2]] after finishing second-last in the league table, at 19th. Prior to club's relegation, Aurier had signed a contract extension with the club through to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier un an de plus|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-un-an-de-plus/188220|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2011–12 Ligue 2|2011–12 season]], Aurier's performance soon attracted interest from clubs around England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse defender Serge Aurier would like move to England|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11820/8732822/toulouse-defender-serge-aurier-would-like-move-to-england|publisher=Sky Sports|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the player considering departing Lens for a new opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier pense à "un départ"|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-pense-a-un-depart/209060|publisher=|work=L'Equipe|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aurier ruled out a move abroad, implying that regardless of whether or not Aurier chose to stay or leave Lens, he would be footballing for a member of France's principal league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier eyes France stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11820/7018449/aurier-eyes-france-stay|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 July 2011|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, however, Aurier began the year with Lens, making 16 appearances in the first half of the season around which time the club was facing financial issues.&lt;ref name="Aurier442"/&gt;

===Toulouse===
On 26 January 2012, Aurier ultimately left Lens, signing for [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] on a four-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serge Aurier à Toulouse |url=http://www.rclensois.fr/transferts/officiel-serge-aurier-a-toulouse-a14229.html |publisher=RC Len |language=French |date =26 January 2012 |accessdate = 26 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003724/http://www.rclensois.fr/transferts/officiel-serge-aurier-a-toulouse-a14229.html|archivedate=5 October 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move came after Toulouse's president hinted he would sign Aurier for a €1.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse veut Aurier (Lens)|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Toulouse-veut-aurier-lens/258843|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurier made his debut for the club two days later in a 2–1 win over [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TOULOUSE VS.

In his first full season at Toulouse, [[2012–13 Ligue 1|2012–13]], Aurier provided an assist for [[Wissam Ben Yedder]] but was sent-off in the 84th minutes for a challenge on [[Henri Bedimo]] in a 1–1 draw with [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dramatic draw in France|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/267307/report|publisher=Sky Sports|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sending off saw him suspended for three games with one-year suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier et Dupont au pilori|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-et-dupont-au-pilori/306558|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving his two games, Aurier made his return on 1 September 2012 in a 1–1 draw against [[Stade de Reims|Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse FC 1 – 1 Stade de Reims|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/feuille_match/75959|publisher=Ligue 1|date=1 September 2012|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal of the season on 11 January 2013 in a 2–2 draw against Saint-Étienne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mollo earns St Etienne a point|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/280692/report|publisher=Sky Sports|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier was sidelined later on in the season after tearing a hamstring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier absent 10 jours|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-absent-10-jours/330137|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and injuring his right knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier blessé au genou droit|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-blesse-au-genou-droit/351886|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=21 February 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being on the sidelines for a period of time, Aurier made 28 appearances, scoring one goal.

Ahead of the [[2013–14 Ligue 1|2013–14 season]], Aurier signed a contract extension, keeping him at Toulouse until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serge Aurier prolonge|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Serge-aurier-prolonge/383416|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after re-ignited interest in his services from clubs around Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Serge Aurier welcomes links to Everton and Marseille|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11820/8789409/transfer-news-serge-aurier-welcomes-links-to-everton-and-marseille|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 June 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the management of [[Alain Casanova]], Aurier found himself playing in a 3–5–2 formation as a right-sided centre back in the three-man defence, as well as a wing-back at times.&lt;ref name="Aurier442"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everything you need to know about...

===Paris Saint-Germain===
On 23 July 2014, Aurier joined [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] on a season-long loan with an option for the Parisian club to purchase outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serge Aurier joins Paris Saint-Germain|url=http://www.psg.fr/en/News/003001/Article/67561/Serge-Aurier-joins-Paris-Saint-Germain|publisher=Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|accessdate=24 July 2014|date=23 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725055318/http://www.psg.fr/en/News/003001/Article/67561/Serge-Aurier-joins-Paris-Saint-Germain|archivedate=25 July 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His move to PSG was believed to be as a replacement for incumbent right back [[Christophe Jallet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jallet proche de Lyon|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Jallet-proche-de-lyon/482712|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon moving to PSG, Aurier stated he had no concern over his first-team chances, despite facing competition from [[Gregory van der Wiel]], who also plays primarily as a right back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Je découvre des compétiteurs|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-je-decouvre-des-competiteurs/490168|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurier made his PSG debut in the [[2014–15 Ligue 1]], coming on as a substitute for Van der Wiel in a 2–0 win over [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] on 16 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Saint-Germain 2 – 1 SC Bastia|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/feuille_match/78796|publisher=Ligue 1|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for PSG in the [[2014–15 Coupe de la Ligue#Round of 16|Round of 16 of Coupe de la Ligue]] in a 3–1 victory over Ajaccio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ajaccio 1–3 Paris Saint-Germain |url= http://www.ligue1.com/coupeLigue/feuille_match/79732 |publisher=Ligue 1 |date=17 December 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the season, Aurier was unable to establish himself in the first team due to his own injury concerns and international commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Côte d'Ivoire : Aurier blessé|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-s-est-blesse/506033|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=10 November 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pastore très incertain contre Caen|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Pastore-incertain-contre-caen/536033|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=13 February 2015|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier played his first PSG match in one month – lasting the entire 90 minutes – in a 2–2 draw against Caen;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Saint-Germain 2 – 2 SM Caen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31458484|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 February 2015|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; his performance was later praised after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le PSG rend hommage à Aurier|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Hommage-a-aurier/536276|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=14 February 2015|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, however, he injured himself and was not substituted out, as manager [[Laurent Blanc]] had previously used all three of his substitutions earlier in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurier sort sur une civière|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Aurier-sort-sur-une-civiere/536330|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=14 February 2015|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst on the sidelines in PSG's [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], Aurier found himself in hot water with [[UEFA]] after criticizing [[Björn Kuipers]]' refereeing decision and calling him a "dirty son of a bitch" in a video posted on Facebook.

Aurier scored his first league goal for PSG goal on 26 September 2015 in a 4–1 win over [[FC Nantes|Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le PSG s'impose largement à Nantes|url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/football/ligue-1/fil-info/le-psg-s-impose-largement-a-nantes-771844|publisher=Le Figaro|language=French|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance, Aurier was named Team of the Week by [[L'Equipe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'équipe type de la 8e journée de Ligue 1|url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/football/ligue-1/actualites/l-equipe-type-de-la-8e-journee-de-ligue-1-772110|publisher=Le Figaro|language=French|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Aurier scored in the Champions League group stage in a 3–0 win over [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Le PSG enchaîne contre le Chakhtior Donetsk (3–0)|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Le-psg-enchaine-contre-le-chakhtior-donetsk-3-0/595133|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier scored against Lyon for the second time in the season three months later on 13 December 2015, helping his team to a 5–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ligue 1 : Le PSG impitoyable avec Lyon|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Ligue-1-le-psg-impitoyable-avec-lyon/616415|publisher=L'Equipe|language=French|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurier was suspended indefinitely on 14 February 2016 for calling teammate [[Ángel Di María]] a "clown" and calling [[Laurent Blanc]] a "''fiotte''" (a homophobic slur) during a question-and-answer session on [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] in which he also criticised supposed favouritism towards striker [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Serge Aurier: Paris St-Germain suspend defender indefinitely |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35573547 |accessdate=14 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PSG suspend Serge Aurier for comments on Laurent Blanc and team-mates |URL= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/14/paris-saint-germain-suspend-serge-aurier-comments-laurent-blanc-champions-league-chelsea |accessdate=14 February 2016 |publisher=The Guardian |date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his suspension, PSG ordered Aurier to train with their [[Paris Saint-Germain Academy|reserve side]] from 29 February until 20 March.&lt;ref name="Serge Aurier: Paris St-Germain right-back to train with reserves"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35674511 | title=Serge Aurier: Paris St-Germain right-back to train with reserves | publisher=BBC Sport | date=26 February 2016 | accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 31 August 2017, Aurier signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee in the region of £23&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41081740 |title=Serge Aurier: Tottenham sign Paris St-Germain full-back for £23m |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Simon Stone |date=31 August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier made his debut on 13 September in a 3–1 win over [[Borussia Dortmund]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/09/13/serge-aurier-no-dummy-debut-strength-depth-suggests-spurs-can/ |title=Serge Aurier no dummy on debut as strength in depth suggests Spurs can make Champions League impact|first=Matt|last= Law |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, Aurier made his full league debut at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], but he was sent off upon receiving a second yellow card as Tottenham held on for a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=West Ham United 2&amp;ndash;3 Tottenham Hotspur|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41290321|accessdate=23 September 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 home win against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 13 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/12/13/tottenham-2-brighton-0-serge-auriers-fluke-helps-send-spurs/ |title=Tottenham 2 Brighton 0: Serge Aurier's fluke helps send Spurs back into top four|first= Matt |last=Law|work= The Daily Telegraph |date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurier competed for the right-back spot with [[Kieran Trippier]] throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham Hotspur news: Serge Aurier ready for battle with World Cup star Kieran Trippier for right-back role |url=https://talksport.com/football/403634/tottenham-hotspur-serge-aurier-battle-kieran-trippier/ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Talksport |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season in London, Aurier was competing for his place not only against Trippier but also with young Englishman [[Kyle Walker-Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stanley |first1=Anton |title=Tottenham Hotspur news: Serge Aurier ready for ‘good fight’ as he attempts to claim starting role |url=https://talksport.com/football/426492/tottenham-hotspur-news-serge-aurier-good-fight-spurs-kieran-trippier/ |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=Talksport |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2019, in an FA Cup third round match away to [[EFL League Two]] club [[Tranmere Rovers]], he scored twice in a 7–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tranmere Rovers 0 Tottenham 7: Llorente hat-trick crowns Spurs rout|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/tranmere-rovers-0-tottenham-7-llorente-hat-trick-crowns-spurs-rout |accessdate=30 January 2019 |work=FourFourTwo |date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Despite having lived in France for over 14 years, Aurier does not hold a French passport,&lt;ref name="SergeAurier1"&gt;{{cite news|title=PSG: Aurier, des bleus a l'ame|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/aurier-des-bleus-a-l-ame-19-10-2016-6225333.php|publisher=Le Parisien Web|date=19 October 2016|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had originally turned down the chance to play for the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="SergeAurier3"&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2014: Ivory Coast profile – Serge Aurier |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/01/world-cup-2014-ivory-coast-serge-aurier |publisher=The Guardian |date=1 June 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lensois.com/breve-28195-cote-d-ivoire-ou-france-aurier-hesite.html |title=Cote d'Ivoire ou France ?

Aurier was included in Ivory Coast's 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fif-ci.com/~v2/?q=article/mondial-2014-11|title=Les 23 Eléphants pour le Brésil|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=1 June 2014|publisher=Ivorian Football Federation|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first group match, against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], he provided assists for both [[Wilfried Bony]] and [[Gervinho]] in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/305826/report|title=World Cup: Ivory Coast hit back to see off Japan|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=15 June 2014|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2014, Aurier was called up for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les 23 d'Hervé Renard|url=http://www.fedivoir.com/fifci/?q=article/can-2015-1|language=French|publisher=[[Ivorian Football Federation|fedivoir.com]]|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229212511/http://www.fedivoir.com/fifci/?q=article%2Fcan-2015-1|archivedate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played six matches and impressed with his displays in the tournament, particularly in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bony a spol. slaví!

In October 2016, during a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup Qualifier]] against [[Mali national football team|Mali]], Aurier rushed to the aid of Mali midfielder, [[Moussa Doumbia (footballer, born 1994)|Moussa Doumbia]], who had suffered an [[epilepsy|epileptic fit]] to prevent him from swallowing his tongue. Despite his good deed, Aurier later drew criticism for celebrating Ivory Coast's second goal with a 'slit throat' gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2914/champions-league/2016/10/19/28619692/angel-and-demon-life-saver-aurier-a-magnet-for-bad-publicity?ICID=HP_BN_6|last=Bairner|first=Robin|title=Angel and demon: Life-saver Aurier a magnet for bad publicity|website=Goal|date=19 October 2016|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurier scored his first goal for the Elephants on 11 January 2017, in a 3–0 friendly win over Uganda in [[Abu Dhabi]], after earlier assisting [[Jonathan Kodjia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oludare|first1=Shina|title=CÔTE D'IVOIRE SEND AFCON WARNING WITH VICTORY OVER UGANDA|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/cote-divoire/1p1nzrgxgd3g5126d2br25nqoj|accessdate=9 September 2017|publisher=Goal.com|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Born in [[Ouragahio]], Ivory Coast, Aurier moved to France at a young age after his parents wanted their children to have a better life.&lt;ref name="SergeAurier2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prospect: Serge Aurier|url=http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2014/prospect-serge-aurier-2/|publisher=Get French Football News|date=23 March 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ripostelaique.com/lorient-psg-le-musulman-aurier-a-sauve-la-soiree-de-lennui.html|title=Lorient-PSG : le musulman Aurier a sauvé la soirée de l’ennui !|date=13 March 2017|work=Riposte Laïque|access-date=27 October 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was passionate about football while growing up.&lt;ref name="SergeAurier2"/&gt; Aurier's younger brother, Christopher, plays for his former club Lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RC Lens – Serge Aurier à ne pas confondre avec Christopher|url=http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/rc-lens-serge-aurier-a-ne-pas-confondre-avec-christopher-9459|publisher=Espoirs du Football|language=French|date=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2016, Aurier was found guilty of assaulting a police officer outside a nightclub in Paris. He was sentenced to two months in prison, but remained at liberty pending an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37470381|title=Paris St-Germain's Serge Aurier given two-month jail term|date=26 September 2016|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although UK authorities granted Aurier a visa in October 2016, it was revoked on 16 November due to his conviction, and as a result, he missed the [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in London that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serge Aurier: PSG defender refused entry to UK before Arsenal game|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38069036|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 November 2016|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===São Paulo===
Lucas joined [[São Paulo FC]] in 2005 after playing for the youth teams of [[Clube Atlético Juventus]] and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] and was known as '''Marcelinho''' since he played for a [[Marcelinho Carioca]] football school as a child and also had physical resemblance with the former footballer.&lt;ref&gt;http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2015/03/05/fifa-decide-que-sao-paulo-nao-precisa-pagar-corinthians-por-lucas.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Having had prominence at youth level, he was promoted to play professionally by Milton Cruz. Lucas made his debut with the São Paulo first-team in 2010, scoring 4 goals and providing four assists in 25 appearances. In the same year, he stated his desire to be known for his given name instead of a nickname to "make his own history in football without comparisons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,sao-paulino-marcelinho-quer-ser-chamado-de-lucas,610386|title=São-paulino Marcelinho quer ser chamado de Lucas – Esportes – Estadão|publisher=Estadao.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/2010/09/ex-marcelinho-lucas-brilha-e-desenha-vitoria-do-sao-paulo-no-choque-rei.html|title=Ex-Marcelinho, Lucas brilha e desenha vitória do São Paulo no 'Choque-Rei'|publisher=Globo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Lucas scored nine goals and provided four assists in 28 appearances in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Campeonato Brasileiro]] and 13 goals and eight assists in all competitions.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
During the summer of 2012, both [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] were reported to be interested in signing Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United crank up £30m Moura bid as Brazil ace expresses doubt over Sao Paulo future|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2170869/Lucas-Moura-open-Manchester-United-switch.html|work=Mail Online|date= 9 July 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2012, [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] won the battle and announced the player would be moving to the club in January 2013.

On 15 October 2016, Lucas scored PSG's first goal in the 13th minute in a 2–1 away win against [[AS Nancy]] in a Ligue 1 match with a curling free-kick from the left which nobody got a touch to; that was his fifth league goal of the [[2016–17 Ligue 1]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/cavani-strikes-again-as-psg-go-second.htm|title=Cavani strikes again as PSG go second|publisher=www.ligue1.com|date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2017–18 Ligue 1]] season, he appeared only as substitute six times for the club, and left in January 2018.&lt;ref name="BBC Jan 2018"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42886758  |title=Lucas Moura: Tottenham sign PSG forward for fee in region of £25m |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released by Feyenoord, he joined [[Eerste Divisie]] team [[Almere City FC|Almere City]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vos|first1=Tim|title=Van Almere naar Wembley: een kleine stap voor Janssen|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/van-almere-naar-wembley-een-kleine-stap-voor-janssen.htm|accessdate=2 July 2016|work=Voetbal International|date=30 March 2016|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skysports"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kabelu|first1=Beya|title=Who is Vincent Janssen?

===AZ===
After two seasons with Almere, Janssen moved to [[Eredivisie]] side [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] in 2015, signing a contract with the club until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AZ legt Coutinho en Janssen vast|trans-title=AZ signs Coutinho and Janssen|url=http://www.ad.nl/eredivisie/az-legt-coutinho-en-janssen-vast~a515e62f/|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=[[Algemeen Dagblad]]|date=27 June 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first official goal for the club against [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.|İstanbul Başakşehir]] in a [[UEFA Europa League]] [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|qualifier]] on 30 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AZ-spits Janssen: "Die keeper moet niet zo wild doen"|trans-title=Az Striker Janssen:"The keeper doesn't have to act so wild"|url=http://www.fcupdate.nl/voetbalnieuws/281116/az-spits-janssen-die-keeper-moet-niet-zo-wild-doen/|accessdate=9 July 2016|work=FCupdate|date=31 July 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uefa Europa League result AZ Alkmaar vs Istanbul BB|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000656/match=2016806/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal in the [[Eredivisie]] was on 4 October 2015, where he scored the first and second goal in a 3–1 home win against [[FC Twente|Twente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AZ wacht tegen FC Twente lang op beloning|trans-title=Az has to wait a bit for the reward against FC Twente|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2061233-az-wacht-tegen-fc-twente-lang-op-beloning.html|accessdate=9 July 2016|work=NOS.nl|date=4 October 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AZ Alkmaar vs FC Twente|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/az-alkmaar-vs-twente/339254}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to score in his first eight matches for the club, he went on to score 20 league goals in the second half of the season – the first player to achieve this feat in 52 years&lt;ref name="skysports"/&gt; – and became the top scorer of the Eredivisie with a total of 27 goals.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 12 July 2016, Janssen joined [[Premier League]] side [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]17&amp;nbsp;million ([[Euro|€]]20&amp;nbsp;million) on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/janssen-move-secured-120716/|title=Janssen move secured|date=12 July 2016|work=tottenhamhotspur.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-07-12/spurs-sign-17m-dutch-striker-janssen/?|title=Spurs sign £17m Dutch striker Janssen|date=12 July 2016|work=itv.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]] had seen Janssen during a [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] friendly with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], saying Janssen "ticked all the boxes we needed". With his signing, he became the most expensive player sold by AZ Alkmaar in their football history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilpatrick|first1=Dan|title=Tottenham Hotspur sign Netherlands international striker Vincent Janssen|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2911444/tottenham-sign-netherlands-international-striker-vincent-janssen|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=ESPNFC|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janssen played in [[2016–17 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|three friendlies]] for Tottenham before the [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17 season]], providing a goal and an assist in the final game against [[Inter Milan]].
