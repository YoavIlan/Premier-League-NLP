Rob Elliot

Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Republic of Ireland national team.

Elliot began his career with Erith Town, before joining Charlton Athletic's academy side. Whilst at Charlton, he was sent out on loan to Bishop's Stortford and Notts County, and also spent two loan spells at Accrington Stanley, where he was nicknamed "The Dilsh". He would then go on to be Charlton's first choice goalkeeper for a number of seasons, until he joined Newcastle United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2011. Signed mainly as a back-up to Tim Krul, he featured for the club sporadically, but became first choice in the 2015–16 season after Krul suffered a season-ending injury.

Through the origins of his father's family, Elliot became eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland national football team, and was first called up in 2013, making his debut the following year.

Born in Greenwich, London, Elliot began his career with non-League side Erith Town before moving to Charlton Athletic, the team he had supported as a child, when he was 17. After becoming a professional player with the Addicks in 2004, he was sent out on loan twice during the 2004–05 season; first to Bishop's Stortford and then Notts County, where he made his Football League debut.

The following season, Elliot spent most of the season on loan at the Conference National club Accrington Stanley, replacing fellow Charlton goalkeeper Darren Randolph who had been on loan at Stanley earlier in the year. He was part of the Accrington Stanley team which won promotion to the Football League as runaway champions, saving a vital penalty in the match which guaranteed them promotion. He joined Stanley again on loan during the 2006–07 season, but failed to displace Ian Dunbavin as the club's first choice goalkeeper. He was voted the best keeper of the past decade for Accrington Stanley in 2010 by numerous key figures for the club, including manager John Coleman.

Back at Charlton, Elliot was considered to be behind Nicky Weaver and Darren Randolph for most of the 2007–08 season. After Randolph moved to Bury on loan Elliot was promoted to second choice. He made an unexpected debut for Charlton on 5 April 2008 after Weaver had been sent off in a match against Plymouth Argyle. He made his first start for Charlton in a League Cup defeat to Yeovil Town in August 2008. During the 2008–09 season, he displaced Weaver and established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper. A string of impressive performances contributing to a record breaking start to a season for Charlton in 2009–10 led to him signing a contract extension committing him to the club until 2012. In August 2011, Newcastle United made an offer of £100,000 which was rejected by Charlton.

On 30 August 2011, Elliot signed for Newcastle United on a five-year contract, becoming their seventh summer signing. He then stated his desire to become first choice 'keeper. He made his Newcastle debut on 20 September against Nottingham Forest in the Football League Cup. 

At the start of the 2012–13 season, Elliot changed his squad number from 35 to 21, which was previously worn by Fraser Forster. He made his second Newcastle appearance in the Europa League on 20 September against Marítimo. His third Newcastle appearance, and second of the season, came in a third round League Cup tie away at Manchester United. On 24 February 2013, and following an injury to Tim Krul, Elliot made his first Premier League appearance for the Magpies, starting against Southampton in a 4–2 victory. During the match, after conceding a goal in the third minute, he then assisted a Papiss Cissé wonder goal in the first half. On 12 May, Elliot was sent off against Queens Park Rangers, following a second yellow card.

Elliot started the 2015–16 season as third choice 'keeper behind Krul and Karl Darlow. However, with Krul suffering a season-ending injury and Darlow still recovering from an ankle knock, Elliot was handed his first appearance of the season on 18 October at home to Norwich City, helping Newcastle to a 6–2 win, their first win of the campaign. Before the game, it was revealed that Elliot had signed a 'new, long-term contract' back in January 2014. Elliot continued his run in the team, keeping successive clean sheets against Stoke City and Bournemouth, the latter performance earning him the man-of-the-match award in a 1–0 win. This was the first time Newcastle had kept two clean sheets in a row in two years and their first away win in ten months.

On 29 March 2016, whilst on international duty, Elliot sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and was ruled out of action for six months, ending his hopes of a place on the Republic of Ireland squad for UEFA Euro 2016.

Elliot returned to the Newcastle squad in December, but by then, Darlow had usurped him as the first choice 'keeper. For the next two months, he was not involved in the first team, but did make two appearances for the reserves. From February 2017 onwards, Elliot would be on the bench until 24 April, when Darlow himself was benched due to squad rotation. Elliot's first appearance of the season came in a 4–1 win over Preston North End. On 28 April, he was named captain against Cardiff City, keeping a clean sheet as Newcastle won 2–0. On 7 May, he again kept a clean sheet, as Newcastle beat Barnsley 3–0, edging out Brighton & Hove Albion by a point to win the Championship.

On 11 August 2017, Elliot's shirt number was changed from 21 to 1 in the 2017–18 squad number announcement, replacing Tim Krul, who had been linked with a permanent move to Brighton & Hove Albion.

Elliot has yet to make an appearance for Newcastle in the 2018-19 season, having lost his place in the side to Martin Dubravka.

Elliot, who was born in England, is eligible for the Republic of Ireland through his father's family from Cork, and represented Ireland at under-19 level. On 5 October 2013, Elliot received his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad as a replacement for the injured Darren Randolph for the games against Germany and Kazakhstan. Elliot won his first international senior cap for the Republic of Ireland on 25 May 2014, in a 2–1 home loss to Turkey.

Ciaran Clark

Ciaran Clark (born 26 September 1989) is a professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Republic of Ireland national team. Clark is naturally a central defender, but is also able to operate as a central midfielder and at left-back.

Clark captained England at under-18, under-19 and under-20 level, but in October 2010 declared his ambition to play for the Republic of Ireland, the country of his parents' birth. He was called up to the national team a month later for the friendly match against Norway, and made his full debut against Wales on 8 February 2011.

Clark was born in Harrow, London, and grew up in Sandy, Bedfordshire. He came through the Aston Villa youth academy after joining at the age of eleven, and captained the academy U18 team to the 2007–08 Premier Academy League—the academy's maiden league title. He was given a squad number for the 2008–09 season and named on the bench for Villa's 2008–09 UEFA Cup match away at CSKA Moscow, but remained an unused substitute. He captained the reserves to the Premier Reserve League South title and defeated PRL North winners Sunderland in the play-off final to win their first ever Reserve League trophy.

Clark was included in the squads for the pre-season friendlies and the 2009 Peace Cup. On 30 August 2009, he made his debut in a 2–0 win against Fulham. With Curtis Davies unavailable through injury, the 19-year-old was named in Villa's starting line-up, partnering Carlos Cuéllar in defence. He helped keep a clean sheet and nearly marked his debut with a goal but sent his header inches wide. Garth Crooks of the BBC named the youngster in his team of the week. Although the formidable partnership of new signings James Collins and Richard Dunne limited him to the bench, he was tipped to break into the first team on a regular basis within several years. In November 2009, he signed a contract extension until 2012.

Clark started in the first two league games of the 2010–11 season: against West Ham United, partnering Richard Dunne and keeping a clean sheet; then against Newcastle United. Clark was also handed a start in Gérard Houllier's first match as new Villa manager, against Blackburn Rovers in the League Cup. He then started the match against local rivals Birmingham City in midfield and continued in the role against Fulham and Blackpool due to the club's injury crisis. On 27 November 2010, Clark scored his first two goals for the club in a 4–2 defeat against Arsenal at home. He scored a 91st-minute equaliser against Chelsea on 2 January 2011 to rescue a point. He also became the only player in Premier League history to be booked in six successive appearances within the same season.

Clark scored his first FA Cup goal for the club against Bristol Rovers on 29 January 2012, with a solo run, including stepovers and a left-footed strike curled into the bottom corner.

On 25 August 2012, he was sent off against Everton for a professional foul on Nikica Jelavić. On 3 September 2012, he scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw away to Newcastle United. On 8 December 2012, after captaining Villa's youth and reserve sides, Clark was handed the armband for the senior side for the first time in a 0–0 draw at home to Stoke, after Gabriel Agbonlahor who had started the match as captain was replaced by Darren Bent. Three days later, Clark followed up his initial role as captain by performing the role again, this time for the full 90 minutes, in a 4–1 victory in the League Cup away at Norwich which saw Villa qualify for the semi-finals.

Clark started Aston Villa's first game in their 3–1 away victory at Arsenal. After a dip in his form midway through Aston Villa's season, he was dropped to the bench as Lambert preferred a partnership between Ron Vlaar and fellow academy graduate, Nathan Baker. However, due to injury constantly plaguing Aston Villa's defence, along with consistently poor results, Clark still managed 28 appearances in a season that saw Villa finish 15th on 38 points. He accumulated nine yellow cards throughout the season.

In January 2014 during a training game Clark broke the right leg of his team-mate Libor Kozák. The mishandled injury virtually ended Kozák's Premier League carrier.

Aston Villa began the 2014–15 season in good form with Paul Lambert re-introducing Alan Hutton, forming a new look back four of Alan Hutton, Ron Vlaar, Philippe Senderos and Aly Cissokho. When an injury ruled Vlaar out, Nathan Baker came into the back four, with Clark remaining on the bench. After injuries to both Baker and Senderos, Clark was called on along with Jores Okore and formed a solid partnership. Clark scored his first goal of the season from a free-kick curled in by Ashley Westwood in a 2–1 home victory over Leicester.

On 3 August 2016, Newcastle announced that they have completed the signing of Clark. Having established himself alongside club captain Jamaal Lascelles in central defence, he scored his first goal for the club in a 6–0 win against Queens Park Rangers on 13 September 2016. He went on to add further goals against Brentford and Bristol City while also helping Newcastle concede the joint-lowest number of goals in the division as they returned to the Premier League at the first time of asking.

Clark captained the England U19 team through qualification for the 2008 European Championships, playing in five out of the six qualifiers and scoring a goal. He missed out on the tournament through an ankle injury sustained during training. After being promoted to the England U20s, he was appointed captain and scored in only his second match, in a friendly against Italy on March 2008.

In late September 2010, Football Association of Ireland (FAI) officials approached Clark about switching his allegiance. They sent scout and former Republic of Ireland under-21 manager, Don Givens, to watch him in the match against Blackburn. On 5 October 2010, it was reported that Clark had pledged his international future to the Irish national team as he qualified through his Irish parents. Richard Dunne played a role in convincing him and had spoken to FAI scouts about his eligibility. On 12 November 2010, Clark was named in the Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly against Norway. He then made his debut on 8 February 2011 against Wales at the Aviva Stadium. On 6 February 2013, Clark scored his first goal for the Republic of Ireland, helping them to a 2–0 friendly victory against Poland.

In Republic of Ireland's opening match at Euro 2016 against Sweden, Clark deflected a ball from Zlatan Ibrahimović into his own net to level the scores. Wes Hoolahan had earlier given Ireland the lead but Clark's mishap saw them share the spoils as the match ended 1–1.

Paul Dummett

Paul Dummett (born 26 September 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a left back for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Wales national team.

Dummett began his career with his local side Newcastle United. After progressing through the youth ranks at the club, he had loan spells at Gateshead and Scottish side St Mirren. He made his Premier League debut in the 2013–14 season and scored his first Premier League goal against Liverpool on 19 October 2013.
Dummett is a first team regular for Newcastle United and was part of their promotion from the Championship.

Dummett started his career in the Newcastle United youth system, captaining the club's reserve team on several occasions.

Dummett joined Conference National side Gateshead in March 2012, initially for a month-long loan, which was then extended until the end of the season, helping the team keep six clean sheets from ten matches.

The following season he was loaned to Scottish Premier League club St Mirren. Dummett made his debut in a 2–0 win over Hearts on 15 September 2012, and scored his first senior goal in a 1–1 draw against St Johnstone.

After returning from his loan spell at St Mirren, Dummett made his debut senior appearance for Newcastle in an FA Cup tie away defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 5 January 2013. After the match, Dummett spoke out on his debut, that his Newcastle United debut was a dream come true. He then rejoined St Mirren on 31 January 2013 on loan for the rest of the season. Dummett played the full game for St Mirren in their Scottish League Cup Final 3–2 win over Hearts, the club's first major cup for 26 years. Dummett also set up the second St Mirren goal in the 46th minute, for Steven Thompson, which put the Saints 2–1 up.

Dummett returned to Newcastle, and signed a one-year contract extension. He made his debut for the club as a substitute during a 4–0 defeat to Manchester City on the opening fixture of the 2013–14 season, coming on after a sending off of fellow defender Steven Taylor and playing the full second half of the game. He scored his first goal for Newcastle in a 2–2 draw at home to Liverpool in October 2013. Just weeks after scoring his goal for the club, Dummett put pen-to-paper on a new contract at Newcastle, signing a deal that could extend until 2019.

On the final day of the season, Dummett made a challenge on Liverpool forward Luis Suárez. Due to knee surgery which jeopardised Suárez's chances of playing at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, fans in his native Uruguay sent online death threats to Dummett.

Dummett started the 2014–15 season as Newcastle's first-choice left back, with Davide Santon injured and Massadio Haïdara on the bench. Dummett grabbed his second Magpies goal on 25 September 2014, scoring a late winner in extra-time against Crystal Palace in the League Cup. Playing alongside captain Fabricio Coloccini in the centre of defence, Dummett helped Newcastle keep clean sheets in victories over Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion.
On 12 January 2016, Dummett scored a 90th minute equaliser against Manchester United in a match that ended in a 3–3 draw at St James' Park.

Dummett qualifies to play for Wales through his Welsh grandfather. He was capped at under-21 level for Wales. He made his senior debut for Wales in the match against the Netherlands on 4 June 2014, coming in as a substitute in the 83rd minute. Dummett played his second international match on 13 November 2015, again against the Netherlands, coming on for Neil Taylor in 65th minute. In May 2016, Dummett was listed for the 29-man squad for a pre-Euro 2016 training camp. However, Dummett was among six players to be cut for the Euro 2016 squad. In May 2017, Wales manager Chris Coleman said that Dummett would no longer make himself available for international selection. He was recalled to the national team in August 2018.

Jamaal Lascelles

Jamaal Lascelles (; born 11 November 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Newcastle United.

Lascelles was born in Derby, Derbyshire. He began his career at Nottingham Forest, progressing through the club's youth system. In January 2011, the club rejected a £5 million offer from Arsenal for him. He signed his first professional contract in March 2011. Lascelles made his first-team debut on 31 January 2012, starting in a 2–0 defeat to Burnley.

In March 2012, Lascelles joined League One club Stevenage, on loan until the end of the 2011–12 season. He made his debut for Stevenage on 13 March 2012, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute in a 1–0 home win over Oldham Athletic, playing in the right-back position. He made his first starting appearance in Stevenage's 6–0 away victory at Yeovil Town on 14 April 2012, scoring the club's fourth goal with a header from Luke Freeman's cross. Lascelles also provided the assist for Patrick Agyemang's goal in the same game. He remained as a first-team regular from then onwards, playing the remaining four games of the regular season as Stevenage secured a League One play-off spot. Lascelles also played in both play-off matches, as Stevenage lost 1–0 on aggregate to Sheffield United. He made nine appearances during his two-month loan spell, scoring once.

On 7 August 2012, Lascelles signed a new four-year contract with Nottingham Forest. He made a total of three appearances in all competitions in the 2012–13 season.

Lascelles broke into the starting line-up in the 2013–14 season, forming a central defensive partnership with Jack Hobbs and making a total of 29 league appearances. On 22 January 2014, Everton were fined £45,000 by the FA over an "unauthorised approach" to Lascelles in 2010 while he was still a youth player at Nottingham Forest. Lascelles was warned as to his future conduct. On 18 March, Lascelles extended his contract in a new four-and-a-half-year deal. A reported £4 million bid from Queens Park Rangers was rejected by the club in July.

On 9 August 2014, Lascelles signed a contract with Premier League club Newcastle United, joining on the same day as Forest teammate Karl Darlow. As part of the deal, both players were loaned back to Nottingham Forest for the 2014–15 season.

Lascelles returned to Newcastle for the 2015–16 season and made his debut for the club on 25 August 2015, against Northampton Town in the League Cup. He made his league debut on 3 October, as a substitute in a 6–1 defeat at Manchester City. Lascelles found first-team football hard to come by and did not make his first league start for Newcastle until 23 January 2016, when he played in the 2–1 defeat to Watford, capping his performance with a goal. Lascelles publicly criticised the mentality of his teammates after a 3–1 loss to Southampton on 11 April 2016, questioning their character and desire. Following injuries to first choice centre-backs Chancel Mbemba and Fabricio Coloccini, Lascelles was given regular minutes under new manager Rafael Benítez and gradually stepped up his game, grabbing his second goal for the club in the 3–0 win over Swansea City on 16 April. Lascelles totalled 18 appearances in his first Premier League season, but could not prevent the club getting relegated.

On 4 August 2016, Lascelles was chosen by Benítez to become the new Newcastle United team captain, succeeding the departed Fabricio Coloccini. Benítez had been impressed by Lascelles' willingness to speak up in the dressing room, in particular his criticism of more senior players in the defeat to Southampton. Despite requiring a double hernia operation, Lascelles played through the pain barrier for the last four months of the 2016–17 season, determined to see the campaign out and ultimately captaining the club to promotion back to the Premier League. His solid performances at the beginning of the 2017–18 season led to him being nominated for the September Premier League Player of the Month award, which was eventually won by Harry Kane. On 6 October 2017, he signed a new six-year contract with Newcastle, keeping him at the club until 2023.

In October 2017, he had a training ground fight with teammate Mohamed Diamé. The two players later apologised and offered to take the entire first-team squad and staff out for lunch.

In October 2018 he signed a new contract until 2024.

Lascelles has represented England at all youth international levels from under-18 to under-21.

On 28 May 2013, he was named in manager Peter Taylor's 21-man squad for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made his debut on 16 June, in a 3–0 win in a warm-up game against Uruguay.

On 27 February 2014, Lascelles received his first under-21 call-up for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying match against Wales. He made his debut, and only under-21 appearance, starting in the qualifying match against Moldova on 9 September 2014.

Jonjo Shelvey

Jonjo Shelvey (born 27 February 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Newcastle United and the English national team.

He began his career at Charlton Athletic, becoming their youngest-ever player at 16 years and 59 days old. In 2010, he moved to Liverpool for an initial £1.7 million, spending a brief loan at Blackpool. During his time at Anfield, Shelvey was part of a Liverpool squad which won the League Cup and lost the FA Cup final in 2012. He joined Swansea City for £5 million in 2013, and Newcastle United for £12 million two and a half years later. A month after joining Newcastle, he was made the team's stand-in captain, as the season ended with relegation.

Shelvey played for England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level and has captained the under-19 team. He won his first cap for the senior team in 2012.

Shelvey played in the youth teams of first Arsenal and then West Ham United, the team he had supported as a boy. In 2004, he moved to Charlton Athletic, making his breakthrough in the 2007–08 season after scoring 14 goals in 23 appearances for Charlton's Under 18s. He made his first-team debut on 26 April 2008, starting in a 3–0 away loss against Barnsley in the Championship. He became Charlton's youngest-ever player, at the age of 16 years and 59 days – beating the previous holder, Paul Konchesky. He still had one week of school remaining when he was given his debut by manager Alan Pardew.

On 3 January 2009, Shelvey became Charlton's youngest-ever goal-scorer, with a strike against Norwich City in the third round of the FA Cup, opening a 1–1 draw. It was 54 days before his 17th birthday, breaking the previous record held by Peter Reeves who was aged 17 years and 100 days when he scored – also against Norwich – in May 1996. Despite interest from several Premier League clubs, on 27 February, his 17th birthday, Shelvey signed his first professional contract with Charlton. He scored his first league goal in the 3–2 win at Southampton on 4 April. Later that month, he scored in consecutive matches, 2–2 home draws against Blackpool and Cardiff City; the season ended with relegation to League One.

In September 2009, he signed a one-year contract extension until 2012. Shelvey contributed four goals from 24 league appearances as the Addicks reached the promotion play-offs.

Shelvey signed for Liverpool in May 2010, for an initial fee of £1.7 million. He made his debut for the club as an extra-time substitute on 22 September in the Reds' shock League Cup third-round defeat against League Two team Northampton Town at Anfield, with Liverpool losing 4–2 on penalties (with Shelvey scoring in the shootout) after a 2–2 draw. Shelvey started his first match for the club in Liverpool's Europa League group match against Napoli on 21 October 2010, playing the whole 90 minutes match in a 0–0 draw. On 24 October, Shelvey made his Premier League debut against Blackburn Rovers at Anfield, coming on for the final stages in place of Raul Meireles in the Reds' 2–1 win.

Shelvey joined Championship club Blackpool on loan on 30 September 2011. The following day he scored on his debut, in a 5–0 win against Bristol City at Bloomfield Road, and also scored his first professional hat-trick in a 5–0 win away at Leeds United on 3 November.

On 30 November 2011, he was recalled by Liverpool due to injury problems within the team, mainly surrounding Steven Gerrard and Lucas Leiva, with the latter set to miss the remainder of the season. He made his first ever Premier League start the following weekend against Aston Villa. On 6 January 2012 he scored his first senior goal for the club in a 5–1 win in a third round FA Cup tie against Oldham Athletic at Anfield, and on 8 May he scored his first Premier League goal with a 30-yard strike in a 4–1 home win over Chelsea. He was absent from Liverpool's win over Cardiff City in the season's League Cup Final, and was an unused substitute in their loss to Chelsea in the FA Cup equivalent.

On 10 July 2012, Shelvey signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool. On 20 September 2012 he came off the bench to score the last 2 goals in a 5–3 win against Young Boys in the Europa League. Three days later, he was sent off in a league match against Manchester United on 23 September 2012. He finished the Europa League group stage with four goals, adding one each in a home defeat to Udinese on 4 October, and a draw with Young Boys on 22 November.

On 3 July 2013, Shelvey signed a four-year contract with Swansea City, for an initial transfer fee of £5 million. He scored his first goal for the club on 16 September 2013, in a 2–2 draw with former club Liverpool, also assisting teammate Michu's goal, but was partly responsible for both Liverpool goals, giving the ball away to Daniel Sturridge and Victor Moses. He scored a goal on 26 April 2014 in a 4–1 defeat of Aston Villa; from Brad Guzan's clearance, Shelvey "controlled the ball with one touch before propelling it over the back-pedalling American's head and into the net."

Shelvey was sent off in a goalless draw at Everton on 1 November 2014, by getting two bookings. First, he kicked the ball away in the 24th minute, then in the 72nd minute, he blocked James McCarthy's run, resulting in the second booking. On 29 December, he caught Liverpool's Emre Can with his arm during a 4–1 away defeat. Although referee Andre Marriner did not punish him for it, the Football Association later gave Shelvey a four-match suspension for violent conduct, with one match having been added to the suspension because of his previous dismissal against Everton. He claimed that the act was unintentional and personally apologised to Can. The day before the Liverpool match, Swansea manager Garry Monk criticised Shelvey's disciplinary record, telling him to "wise up" and put a stop to an accumulation of yellow cards earned through "laziness".

In July 2015, Shelvey signed a new, four-year deal with the Swans, which would have kept him at the club until the summer of 2019.

On 10 January 2016, following a shock 3–2 defeat to League Two team Oxford United in the FA Cup, Shelvey appeared to become embroiled in a row with one Swansea fan and then appeared to invite the man to meet him outside. Manager Alan Curtis responded stating "we expect more from Jonjo, it is as simple as that".

On 12 January 2016, Newcastle United announced they had signed Shelvey on a five-and-a-half-year deal, for a reported fee of £12 million. Four days later he made his debut in a 2–1 Premier League victory over West Ham United, the first win for the club in seven matches. He was named man of the match for his involvement in the build-up to both of Newcastle's goals.

While Newcastle were on a training break in La Manga on 20 February, manager Steve McClaren announced that Shelvey had been made the team's captain. He served the role as Fabricio Coloccini stayed out through a calf injury, and said that he wanted to help the club avoid relegation; they were unsuccessful in that aim.

Shelvey scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion on 27 August 2016. In December 2016, Shelvey was banned for five matches after being found guilty of using racially abusive language towards Wolverhampton Wanderers player, Romain Saïss, in a match on 17 September 2016. He was also fined £100,000 and ordered to attend a Football Association education course. He made 47 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2016–17 as Newcastle were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Championship title.

Ahead of the new season, Shelvey changed his squad number from 12 to 8. On 13 August 2017, in Newcastle United's first match back in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur, Shelvey was sent off three minutes into the second half of the match, for stamping on Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli. Newcastle would go on to lose the match 2–0, with Shelvey later apologising for his violent conduct.

Shelvey captained the England under-16s as they won the 2007 Victory Shield scoring three goals in three matches. He played a key role in the Montaigu Tournament, which England won for the first time in seven years, playing in all four matches and scoring a free kick in the final against France. In October 2008, he made his debut for the England under-17s and scored in a 7–0 win over Estonia.

On his debut for the England under-19s, in September 2010, he captained and scored a free-kick in a 2–0 win over Slovakia, and followed up by scoring on his following two appearances for the team. He won his first Under-21 cap coming on as substitute in a 6–0 win against Azerbaijan in September 2011.

England's senior manager Roy Hodgson claimed that Shelvey missed the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship because he was "reticent" about playing at that level following his senior international debut. Shelvey responded by saying that he had been told by under-21 manager Gareth Southgate that he would not feature in that squad, and claimed that if he had ever refused international duty he would have faced the wrath of his father.

Shelvey was eligible to play for Scotland – through his grandfather – and the Republic of Ireland, but chose to represent England. In October 2012 Shelvey was called up for the England squad for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against San Marino and Poland, and made his senior debut from the bench on 12 October 2012, in a 5–0 home win against San Marino, replacing Michael Carrick in the 66th minute.

On 5 September 2015, Shelvey was selected to start for England for the first time in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against San Marino, becoming the first man to be capped for England whilst playing for Swansea City. He was named man of the match by the BBC as England ran out 6–0 winners in Serravalle.

Shelvey was born in Romford, London and grew up in a council flat in Harold Hill. Due to crime in the neighbourhood, he bought his sister a home in Brentwood when she became pregnant. His older brother George was, according to Shelvey, a better footballer, but his career was ruined by drinking and partying.

Shelvey fell down a staircase as a baby, one of several childhood traumas which he believes could have caused the alopecia which caused his hair loss. He was prescribed a cream and told to sleep in a woolly hat for a month in order to combat it, but abandoned treatment because of the discomfort it caused, and said of his baldness, "If you don't like it, don't talk to me". Shelvey has supported youngsters who share his condition.

In June 2015, Shelvey married Daisy Evans, formerly of the pop group S Club 8. Comedian Jimmy Carr performed at the event. The couple have a daughter, born the previous year. After his marriage, Shelvey advertised for a live-in chef, who would receive an annual salary of £65,000. He stated that his family responsibilities and new diet would improve his professional behaviour.

Salomón Rondón

José Salomón Rondón Giménez (; born 16 September 1989) is a Venezuelan professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Newcastle United on loan from West Bromwich Albion, and the Venezuela national team.

After starting out at Aragua, he went on to spend most of his career in Europe, appearing in La Liga with Málaga, the Russian Premier League with Rubin Kazan and Zenit Saint Petersburg (winning the 2015 national championship with the latter club) and the Premier League with West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United.

A Venezuela international since 2008, Rondón represented his country in three Copa América tournaments.

Born in Caracas, Rondón's sporting idols growing up were Ronaldo and Michael Jordan. He made his debut in the Venezuelan Primera División at the age of 17, appearing for Aragua FC against Carabobo FC on 8 October 2006; on 8 April of the following year he scored his first goal(s) for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Caracas FC.

In the summer of 2008, Rondón was signed by UD Las Palmas in Spain, and made his official debut on 5 October in a 1–2 away loss against Deportivo Alavés for the Segunda División championship. Almost one year after his arrival, on 2 September 2009, he netted his first goal, in a Copa del Rey match against Cádiz CF – becoming the youngest foreign player to ever score for the club, at the age of 19 years, 11 months and 17 days– and finished the season with ten goals in 36 games, as the Canary Islands side narrowly avoided relegation.

On 19 July 2010, Málaga CF signed Rondón for a record €3.5 million transfer fee. He scored his first goal for the Andalusians exactly two months later, in a 1–2 home defeat against Sevilla FC in La Liga. Four days later, he opened the score in a 2–0 win at Getafe CF, adding a third the following week in a 2–3 home loss to Villarreal CF.

On 1 May 2011, Rondón contributed with one goal as Málaga came from behind at home to defeat Hércules CF 3–1. That was his 13th goal of the campaign, with which he surpassed the record of goals from a Venezuelan footballer in the Spanish top flight previously held by Juan Arango; the team finally escaped relegation, with the player finishing as their top scorer.

Rondón started 2011–12 on the substitutes bench. He eventually beat competition from ageing Ruud van Nistelrooy, again finishing as Málaga's best scorer – this included goals in narrow home wins against RCD Espanyol (2–1) and Levante UD (1–0), and a brace against Rayo Vallecano (4–2 success, also at La Rosaleda Stadium).

In August 2012, Rondón signed for Russian Premier League team FC Rubin Kazan, for a reported fee of €10 million which made him the most expensive Venezuelan player in history. He made his league debut on the 12th in a 2–0 home win over FC Dynamo Moscow, and he scored his first goal against FC Terek Grozny on 1 September, albeit in a 1–2 home defeat.

Rondón made his first appearance in the UEFA Europa League against Inter Milan, and he scored once in a 2–2 group stage away draw, also playing the entire match. In the second match between the two sides he netted a brace in the final three minutes, helping his team to a 3–0 win.

On 10 March 2013, following the winter break in the Russian Premier League, Rondón scored the only goal of the match as Rubin claimed a home victory over reigning champions FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. In continental competition, he opened up the scoring in the 100th minute of the round-of-16 clash against Levante, latching on to a cross from Bibras Natkho as the hosts won it 2–0 in that leg and on aggregate.

On 19 April 2013, Rondón opened the scoring for Rubin, who could only manage a 1–1 draw at relegation-threatened FC Amkar Perm. In the club's next league match, against PFC CSKA Moscow, he netted the first goal in a 2–0 victory over the league leaders and eventual champions.

On 1 September 2013, Rondón scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win against recently promoted FC Ural Sverdlovsk Oblast.

On 31 January 2014, Rondón underwent a medical and joined fellow league club Zenit Saint Petersburg, signing a five-year contract for a fee in the region of £15.8 million. He played his first game for his new team on 25 February, scoring in an eventual 2–1 away win against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League's round of 16-second-leg (4–5 aggregate defeat).

On 6 April 2014, again as a second-half substitute, Rondón scored a rare second-half hat-trick in a 6–2 home routing of former team Rubin. On 20 September he added another three, in a 5–0 win at FC Rostov.

On 26 February 2015, Rondón scored a brace at home against PSV Eindhoven, being essential in a 3–0 home victory for the Europa League round-of-32 and a 4–0 aggregate triumph.

On 10 August 2015, Rondón joined English club West Bromwich Albion on a four-year-deal for a club-record fee of £12 million. He made his debut in the Premier League five days later, replacing Craig Gardner in the 62nd minute of an eventual 0–0 away draw against Watford. On the 23rd he made his first start, at the expense of Tottenham Hotspur-linked Saido Berahino, in a 2–3 home defeat to Chelsea, assisting James Morrison in his first goal and later being brought down by John Terry who received a straight red card.

Rondón scored his first goal for the Baggies on 29 August 2015, netting the game's only in stoppage time of the first half of the away fixture against nine-man Stoke City. On 19 December, he was sent off at the end of a 1–2 home loss to Bournemouth for thrusting his head at Dan Gosling, with teammate James McClean also dismissed in the first half; he finished his first season in English football with ten goals.

Rondón began the 2016–17 campaign strongly, scoring the winner goal on the opening match victory against Crystal Palace, then continued his impressive form in September with goals in consecutive matches against West Ham United and Stoke. On 21 November he netted once and provided an assist in a 4–0 victory over Burnley, and on 14 December, against Swansea City, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick after netting three headers in a 3–1 win, which was only the second time this feat was achieved in the history of the competition, the first being Everton's Duncan Ferguson in 1997.

Rondón's goal in 1–1 draw with Tottenham, on 25 November 2017, made him the first Venezuelan to score at either the rebuilt Wembley Stadium or the original facilities, as well as the first Albion player to score at the new ground. The following 20 January, early into the second half of the away fixture against Everton, he accidentally broke James McCarthy's leg, being reduced to tears after realising the outcome.

On 6 August 2018, Rondón joined Newcastle United on a one-year loan deal, with Dwight Gayle heading in the opposite direction in the same situation. He made his debut five days later, in a 2–1 home loss against Tottenham on the opening day of the season. He scored his first goal in a EFL Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest on 29 August, with a late equaliser that failed to prevent his team's elimination in the second round (3–1 defeat at City Ground).

Rondón opened his league account on 10 November 2018, scoring twice to help the hosts defeat Bournemouth 2–1.

Rondón appeared for the Venezuela under-20 side in the 2009 FIFA World Cup in Egypt. He scored four times during the competition – as teammate Yonathan del Valle, with both netting hat-tricks in the 8–0 group stage routing of Tahiti – as the former managed to qualify to the last-16 stage.

Previously, on 3 February 2008, 18-year-old Rondón made his debut for the senior team in a friendly with Haiti, scoring his first goal on 23 March against El Salvador (another exhibition match, another 1–0 win). Selected by manager Noel Sanvicente to the 2015 Copa América, he scored in "La Vinotinto"'s first game of the tournament to help defeat Colombia 1–0; later that year, he was among 15 national players who threatened to quit the team after the president of the Venezuelan Football Federation accused them of conspiring to get the manager sacked.

On 5 June 2016, during the Copa América Centenario, Rondón earned his 50th cap, starting in a 1–0 group stage win against Jamaica in Chicago. He scored the only goal of the following game against Uruguay to become the first Venezuelan player to find the net at three tournaments, and repeated the feat in the quarter-finals, a 1–4 defeat to Argentina.

Mohamed Diamé

Mohamed Diamé (born 14 June 1987), also known as Momo Diamé, is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Newcastle United.

Though born in France, Diamé represented Senegal at international level and made 31 appearances before retiring from national duty in 2017.

Diamé was born in the Paris suburb of Créteil and he was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy between 2000 and 2003. Diamé began his professional career in 2003 with RC Lens, but left four years later after facing health problems. After a full recovery, he signed for lowly Spanish side CD Linares in 30 July 2007, and moved to Rayo Vallecano the following year, helping the Madrid-based team to a mid-table position in the Segunda División, after being promoted in the 2007–08 season. During his time with Rayo it was reported that La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona were interested in signing the midfielder, as well as Premier League side Arsenal.

On 22 August 2009, Diamé joined Wigan Athletic, signing a three-year contract. The transfer had earlier been temporarily put on hold, after alleged heart problems were found. Diamé made his debut the same day as his transfer, in a 5–0 defeat to Manchester United. He scored his first goal for Wigan against Sunderland on 6 February 2010. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he left Wigan after declining their offer to extend his contract.

On 20 June 2012, Diamé joined West Ham United, signing a three-year contract. Diamé made his debut for West Ham on 18 August 2012 in a 1–0 win against Aston Villa. He scored his first goal for West Ham United in the 3–1 defeat to Arsenal on 6 October 2012. His second goal for the club was scored in the 3–1 victory over Chelsea on 1 December 2012. On 9 December 2012, Diamé was injured in a match against Liverpool; it was initially thought he could be out for up to 3 months. In January 2013, after a number of clubs were purported to be interested in signing him, Diamé stated that he wished to stay with West Ham. Diamé did not leave the club in the transfer window, and manager Sam Allardyce stated that it was an important decision.

On 1 September 2014, Diamé joined Hull City, signing a three-year contract. Two weeks later, he made his debut at the KC Stadium, scoring against his former club West Ham in a 2–2 draw.

On 28 May 2016, Diamé scored in the Championship play-off final in a 1–0 win against Sheffield Wednesday, giving Hull an immediate return to the Premier League after their relegation in the 2014–15 season.

On 3 August 2016, Diamé joined Newcastle United, signing a three-year contract. Diamé scored his first goals for Newcastle when he scored twice in an EFL Cup win against Preston North End on 25 October 2016.

In October 2017 he had a training ground fight with teammate Jamaal Lascelles. The two players later apologised and offered to take the entire first team squad and staff out for lunch.

On 22 March 2011, Diamé was called up to play for Senegal, for whom he qualifies as his father was born in Dakar. Diamé made his international debut later that month.

In July 2012, Diamé was announced as one of three over-age players in Senegal's squad for the 2012 Olympics. He scored his first international goal for Senegal on 26 March 2016 in a 2–0 win against Niger in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match.

Matt Ritchie

Matthew Thomas Ritchie (born 10 September 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Scotland national team. He previously played for Portsmouth, Swindon Town and AFC Bournemouth. He joined Newcastle United in 2016.

Born and raised in England, Ritchie qualified to play for Scotland through his Scottish father. He made his senior international debut on 25 March 2015, in a friendly match against Northern Ireland.

Ritchie had been involved in Portsmouth's academy since he turned 13, previously playing football locally in Gosport, starting at the age of six. After signing his first professional contract with the club, and a positive 2008–09 pre-season campaign, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 victory over hometown club Gosport Borough, after the match, Ritchie said scoring a hat-trick was 'unreal'.

He went on loan to Swindon Town in 2010 but due to Portsmouth's mounting injury list, he was recalled in March and was named on the bench for their 2–0 Premier League loss at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur after making four appearances for Swindon. On 14 April, he made his League debut for Portsmouth in the game against Wigan Athletic. He played 79 minutes but was then substituted for Frédéric Piquionne. After the match, Ritchie admits making his Portsmouth debut was a dream come true. At the end of the season, with Portsmouth's relegation from the Premier League confirmed, he signed a new two-year deal.

For the 2010–11 season, Ritchie was handed the number 5 shirt and was selected in Portsmouth's starting XI for their first match of the season at Coventry City. However, he soon found himself out of the Portsmouth line-up and, with the club having disbanded its reserve team, manager Steve Cotterill agreed to loan out the player for fitness reasons.

Ritchie played reserve and academy football at Pompey until late September and continued to impress until he was taken on a one-month loan deal by League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge. He made his Football League debut against Rotherham United on 27 September 2008, coming on as a late substitute. Ritchie scored on his first competitive start for the "Daggers" in a 2–0 win over Rochdale. He scored again in his next match, a 2–0 win over Barnet.

Ritchie also made clear his wishes to extend the loan deal until the end of the season. Dagenham announced on 30 December that the player would remain with the club until the end of the current season. His impressive performances saw him rewarded with a new two-year deal at Portsmouth, and their Young Player of the Season Award.

On 28 July 2009, it was reported that Notts County, were in talks with Portsmouth over a six-figure fee for his services, believed to be £100,000. On 1 September 2009, Ritchie signed on loan until 31 December, although County wanted to extend his loan deal.

After Danny Wilson failed to secure Ritchie's services on a permanent deal during the transfer window, it was announced on 11 February 2010 that Swindon Town had signed the midfielder on loan for the remainder of the season. He made his debut on 23 February against Stockport County after coming on for Danny Ward after 25 minutes.

After making a brief appearance for Pompey on 4 October, Ritchie was loaned again to Swindon Town, on a one-month deal. Two weeks later the deal was extended to two months.

On 7 January 2011, Swindon Town signed Ritchie on a two-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee. He added to his tally with goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 3–2 loss, a 4–1 loss to Southampton, a 1–1 draw with Hartlepool United and a 2–1 loss against Notts County. Despite Swindon Town being relegated to League Two, Ritchie was named the Robins' Player of the Season.

Under manager Paolo Di Canio in League Two, he retained his first team place in the starting eleven and scoring form with ten goals that season. During the season, Ritchie was linked with League One clubs, with the likes of Bournemouth interested in signing the player. After Bournemouth's bid for him was rejected, manager Di Canio said that he was worth about £2 million.
In March, he won the Football League Two Player of the Year for 2012. With teammate Paul Caddis he was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year.

Ahead of a new season in League One, Swindon turned down a £900,000 offer from a League One club for Ritchie, insisting he would be sold for £2.5 million. Shortly afterwards he signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2014.

On 30 January 2013, Ritchie signed for AFC Bournemouth on a three-and-a-half year deal for £400,000. After leaving Swindon Town, he said that he was surprised to leave the club and that he had left with a "heavy heart". However, Di Canio claimed that the club sold Ritchie behind his back.

He made his debut on 2 February in a 3–0 win over Milton Keynes Dons. Ritchie scored his first goal for his new team on 23 March in a 4–1 win over Bury. That win was the first of an eight match run of successive wins, including a brace for Ritchie in a 3–1 victory over Notts County, that culminated in clinching promotion to the Championship.

He was a key performer for Bournemouth during the 2014–15 season. His form helped the side to top the Championship and won him international recognition with Scotland. By April, he had scored 11 goals and provided 13 assists for his team. Ritchie's form saw him voted the Football League's best player in a poll by "FourFourTwo" magazine.

On 19 September 2015, he scored his first ever goal in the Premier League, coming on for Bournemouth in a 2–0 home win against Sunderland. On 25 October 2015, Ritchie scored his team's only goal of the game after just 1 minute, in Bournemouth's 5–1 drubbing by Tottenham.

On 1 July 2016, Ritchie signed a five-year contract with newly relegated Newcastle United, becoming the third signing under manager Rafael Benítez. He made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss to Fulham, playing the full 90 minutes. His first goal, a penalty, came two matches later in a 4–1 win over Reading. From then on, Ritchie would become the club's designated penalty taker and had a 100% success rate in all competitions, converting from the spot five times. He was involved in two penalty related incidents over the course of the season. On 25 October, he refused to hand the ball to Aleksandar Mitrović, tucking it under his shirt, before scoring the third goal in a 6–0 win over Preston North End. On 5 April 2017, against Burton Albion, Ritchie scored a penalty, but it was not awarded due to encroachment by Dwight Gayle. However, referee Keith Stroud awarded a direct free kick to Burton, rather than allowing Ritchie to retake the penalty. Ultimately, it did not matter as he scored the winner anyway, to keep Newcastle in the promotion hunt. Ritchie's season was ended by suspension, when he argued with a match official after a home draw with Leeds United. Ritchie scored sixteen goals in all competitions, with only Gayle having netted more than the Scotsman.

On 26 August, Ritchie assisted Ciaran Clark for the second goal of the match, as Newcastle got their first win of the season, beating West Ham United 3–0. He was then credited with the assists for the goals scored by Jamaal Lascelles and Christian Atsu in wins over Swansea City and Stoke City. On 28 November, he assisted both Newcastle goals from set-pieces in a 2–2 draw with West Bromwich Albion. In the second half of the season, Ritchie scored three times, all in home wins over Manchester United, Southampton and Arsenal.

On 11 August 2018, Ritchie set up Joselu for the equaliser, in a 2–1 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur. He was taken off in the second half, much to his disapproval; his emotional outburst on the bench was captured on television cameras, and was discussed on the following night's "2 Good 2 Bad" segment on "Match of the Day 2". On 26 November, Ritchie assisted Clark for the second goal of the match in a 2–1 away win over Burnley, although in the second half, he missed a sitter from two yards.

Under FIFA eligibility rules, Ritchie was eligible for the national teams of England, where he was born and raised, and Scotland, his father's native land. On 16 March 2015, he was called up to the Scotland national football team for a friendly against Northern Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar. Ritchie made his debut against Northern Ireland on 25 March at Hampden Park, and took the 85th-minute corner which set up Christophe Berra's header for the only goal of the game. On 5 June he scored his first international goal, a 20-yard strike which was the only goal of a friendly victory over Qatar at Easter Road in Edinburgh. His second goal came in a European Championship qualifier against Poland at Hampden Park on 8 October 2015, for which he won "Goal of the Year" award from the Scottish FA.

Martin Dúbravka

Martin Dúbravka (; born 15 February 1989) is a Slovakian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Newcastle United and the Slovakia national football team.

As a child, Dúbravka enjoyed playing ice hockey as well as football, and could have moved into the former sport were it not for a leg injury he sustained when he was five years old.

Dúbravka made his senior team debut in a 5–2 home win against Dubnica on 26 May 2009. In the next season he played 26 Corgoň Liga games, finishing as a league champion. He became a first choice after the transfer of Dušan Perniš in January 2010. He qualified with Žilina to the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League and played all 6 group games. He kept a clean sheet in the play-off round against Sparta Prague. On 30 January 2014, he signed a 3½ year deal with the Danish Superliga club Esbjerg fB.

Dúbravka joined Slovan Liberec of the Czech First League in July 2016 on a one-year contract. He joined Sparta Prague in June 2017, signing a three-year contract.

In January 2018, Newcastle United showed interest in Dúbravka, initially offering Sparta Prague a loan for €500,000, with an option to sign in the summer for €4.5 million. He finally joined the Premier League side on 31 January 2018, the final day of the winter transfer window on a half-year loan deal, due to expire at the end of 2017–18 season. According to isport.cz, he joined the club for €2 million, with an option to sign in the summer for €4 million. 

He made his debut on 11 February, playing a pivotal role and keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win against Manchester United. He became the sixteenth Slovak player and only the second Slovak goalkeeper, after Ján Mucha, to start in a Premier League fixture. After a very successful loan spell, he signed permanently for Newcastle on 30 May for an undisclosed fee of around 5 million euros.

On 17 February 2019 in Durham, Dúbravka was recognised as the Player of the Year 2018 by North East Football Writers' Association, joing the alikes of Alan Shearer, Kevin Keegan or Shay Given. He became the 7th goalkeeper to win the award, in its 39 seasons. Dúbravka stated that he was happy to win the award because "amazing players have won this trophy before". 

Dúbravka, a former under-19 and under-21 national player, was selected for the Slovakia national football team for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying home game against Republic of Ireland.

Dúbravka made his national team debut against Montenegro on 23 May 2014 (2–0 win).

In January 2017, he played his first full game for the national team, having played 45 minutes in both of his previous matches. While he was benched against Uganda (1–3 loss), on 12 January he was fielded in an unofficial friendly match against Sweden in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Slovakia lost the game 0–6, despite only trailing 0–1 at half time. This match also marked the first time Dúbravka conceded in the national team and he was also Slovak captain for the game, being the most experienced with international football.

He made his competitive debut in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier, against Lithuania (2–1 win), on 10 June 2017, when the preferred goalkeeper in the qualification, Matúš Kozáčik, was unavailable due to injury. He however achieved his first competitive clean sheet on 1 September in a home qualifier against Slovenia. Slovakia won thanks to an 81st-minute goal by Adam Nemec. Just as in the previous cap, Dúbravka was chosen due to a prolonged injury of Kozáčik. After Kozáčik's return to the squad, Dúbravka remained preferred for the remaining matches against England, Scotland and Malta. In the match against Scotland, Dúbravka made a series of saves before he was finally beaten by an own goal from Martin Škrtel.

Dúbravka was nominated for a double fixture against Czech Republic and Sweden on 13 October and 16 October 2018, respectively. He played the entirety of both games, but was also involved in an incident, that had led to resignation of Ján Kozák, then Slovakia's longest-serving and most successful coach, who introduced him to the national team.

Dúbravka violated the code of conduct of national team players, along with Michal Šulla, Norbert Gyömbér, Ľubomír Šatka, Milan Škriniar, Vladimír Weiss and Stanislav Lobotka. On the night of 13 October 2018, after loss in Slovakia's second UEFA Nations League fixture and a derby match against Czech Republic (1–2), they left the hotel and went out, missed the bedtime and violated the wellness policy, regarding regeneration and rehabilitation. They were allegedly discovered by Ján Kozák at about midnight, admitting to the incident and apologising during the next day.
Ján Kozák resigned from the national team during the afternoon of 14 October, revealing the details of his decision in a press conference on 18 October, to avoid distractions during the preparation for the fixture against Sweden, that was managed by his former assistant Štefan Tarkovič on a caretaker basis. Kozák cited his inability to work with such squad under these conditions as the primary reason, as almost a third of the team was concerned, including players, those Kozák described as crucial, with Dúbravka being a part of this group. President of SFZ, Ján Kováčik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for future nominations and performances in the national team during the upcoming qualification cycle. During the press conference, Kozák also revealed that Dúbravka had claimed "difficult times at Newcastle" as one of the reasons for his conduct.

On 19 October, SFZ published Dúbravka's official statement. He acknowledged that missing the bedtime was a violation, but maintained that the rest was within norms. He accepted any sanctions and stressed that the conduct was not aimed against Kozák, commenting that he regrets that Kozák didn't accept an apology from the trespassers. He also stated that Kozák's resignation surprised him, because of the good relations within the team.

Dúbravka is a third-generation goalkeeper: his father and grandfather also played in the position. Dúbravka has been dubbed the "quintessential sweeper-keeper" due to his "outstanding footwork" and he believes "in modern football the keeper's almost like a libero. You need to play with the ball, not just kick it long".

Louise Taylor of "The Guardian" christened Dúbravka the "reluctant keeper" after he admitted his favourite position to play is right wing; he sometimes plays as an outfielder in training and coaching staff have suggested that he switch to a midfield role.

Yoshinori Muto

He started his career with J1 League club FC Tokyo in 2013 who he played with for three seasons. In May 2015, he signed for German club Mainz 05 where he amassed 72 appearances and scored 23 goals before moving to Premier League club Newcastle United in August 2018.

As a child, Muto joined FC Tokyo's youth system, where he kept developing until 2010. He then enrolled in the Faculty of Economics of Keio University but kept playing football, for Keio's team. Despite an injury which sidelined him, in his first season with Keio he won the "Rookie of the Year" title.

In 2012 and 2013, FC Tokyo included him in their roster as a "Special Designated Player", an option that allows J-League clubs to field university players without a professional contract. However, he got on the pitch just once, at the end of a match in July 2013.

In 2014, he signed his first professional contract with FC Tokyo and was given the shirt number 14. Coach Massimo Ficcadenti decided to use him from the first league round and, at the end of the season, Muto reached 33 appearances and scored 13 goals, matching the top debut record in the Japanese first division. At the end of the season, he was part of the J-League's Best XI.

Muto graduated from Keio University in March 2015, and the following month was subject to a bid by Chelsea. In April, he was elected as March's MVP (Player of the Month) in the J-League.

On 30 May 2015, Muto joined Bundesliga club Mainz 05 on a four-year contract until 2019. On 31 October 2015, he scored a hat-trick for the first time in his career and also became the second Japanese player after Naohiro Takahara to score a hat-trick in the Bundesliga, in his team's 3–3 draw against FC Augsburg.

Premier League club Newcastle United announced on 27 July 2018 that they had reached a deal to sign Muto, pending him being granted a UK work permit. He was granted the work permit on 2 August, officially becoming a Newcastle player on a four-year contract as part of a £9.5 million fee.

Muto’s first goal for Newcastle came in a 3–2 away loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Muto made his debut for Japan on 5 September 2014 in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Uruguay at the Sapporo Dome, replacing Yusuke Minagawa after 58 minutes. Four days later at Yokohama's Nissan Stadium he scored his first international goal, coming on as a half-time substitute against Venezuela and scoring the first goal of a 2–2 draw six minutes later.

As a substitute, Muto played all of Japan's matches at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia, ending with defeat to the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals.

On 31 May 2018, he was named in Japan's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Ayoze Pérez

Ayoze Pérez Gutiérrez (; born 29 July 1993) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward and attacking midfielder for Premier League club Newcastle United.

He began his career at hometown club CD Tenerife, where he received several personal awards for his performances in the 2013–14 Segunda División season before joining Newcastle for around €3 million.

Ayoze has represented Spain internationally at under-21 level.

Born in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Ayoze finished his formation with local Tenerife, making his senior debuts with the B-team in the 2011–12 season, in the fourth division. He appeared with the main squad in the third level in the following campaign, featuring in 16 matches and scoring once as the "Blanquiazules" returned to division two after a two-year absence.

After impressing in the 2013 pre-season, Ayoze played his first professional match on 18 August, starting in a 1–0 away defeat against Alcorcón. He scored his first goal in the "silver category" on 29 September, in a 1–0 home win over Real Madrid Castilla.

On 23 March of the following year Ayoze scored his first hat-trick of his career, starting in a 5–0 thrashing against Ponferradina. This was one of the performances which earned him the league's Player of the Month award, which he retained for a second consecutive time while his manager Álvaro Cervera won the equivalent.

In October 2014, Ayoze won the "Breakthrough Player in the 2013–14 Segunda División" and "Best Attacking Midfielder in the 2013–14 Segunda División" awards at the LFP Awards Ceremony.

On 5 June 2014 Ayoze rejected interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Porto to join Premier League club Newcastle United for an estimated €3 million fee. The deal was confirmed a day later. He made his league debut on 17 August, replacing fellow debutant Emmanuel Rivière in the 83rd minute of a 2–0 home defeat against Manchester City.

Ayoze scored his first goal in his first league start on 26 October, in a 2–1 away win over Tottenham Hotspur. Six days later, as a half-time substitute for Papiss Cissé, he scored the only goal of the game to defeat Liverpool and give Newcastle their fourth successive win. On 9 November, Ayoze made it three league goals in as many games in a 2–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion. He scored less frequently in the second half of the season as Newcastle struggled, but his equaliser against the same opponents on 9 May 2015 ended a run of eight consecutive defeats under John Carver, as Newcastle avoided relegation.

Ayoze scored Newcastle's first in a 2–2 draw with title holders Chelsea on 26 September 2015. On 18 October, he recorded a goal in a 6–2 rout of Norwich City, Newcastle's first win of the season. He scored the only goal of an away win at Bournemouth on 7 November, with Newcastle's only shot on target. On 13 December, as a substitute, he scored an added-time winner at Tottenham Hotspur, moving Newcastle out of the relegation places.

On 1 February 2016, Newcastle United announced that Ayoze signed a new contract, committing himself to the club until the summer of 2021.

Ayoze stayed with Newcastle despite a drop into the Championship, helping the club return to the Premiership immediately after one season. Ayoze ended the season with 9 goals in 25 appearances, with 11 of them coming as starts, scoring key goals against title rivals Brighton as well as Barnsley to help seal the Championship title on the final day of the season.

He scored his first Premier League goal of the season in a 2–2 draw at Southampton on 15 October. He then scored in consecutive matches in a 1–0 away win over Stoke City and a brace in a 3–1 home win over Luton in the FA Cup. On 31 March 2018, Ayoze ended his 8-match goalless run by scoring the only goal in a victory over Huddersfield, in the 80th minute. Ayoze continued his good form with a goal and an assist each, in wins over Leicester City and Arsenal.

On 29 August 2014, Ayoze received his first call-up to the Spain national under-21 team for the 2015 European Under-21 Championships qualifying matches against Hungary and Austria. He made his under-21 debut as a 77th-minute substitute for Munir El Haddadi against Hungary on 4 September.

Ayoze's older brother, Samuel, is also a forward, who has played for Blyth Spartans and Berwick Rangers. Cousin María José Pérez is a forward for Levante UD Femenino and the Spain women's national team.

Javier Manquillo

Javier Manquillo Gaitán (; born 5 May 1994) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right back for English club Newcastle United.

Born in Madrid, Manquillo started playing football with hometown's Real Madrid alongside his twin brother Víctor, a forward. However, in mid-2007, the club decided to release the latter and the former followed suit, with both signing for neighbouring Atlético Madrid 48 hours later. In November 2011 he made his unofficial debut with first team, playing in a friendly game against Zamalek SC; late into the month, he extended his contract until 2016.

On 8 December 2011, Manquillo made his official debut for the "Colchoneros", starting in a 1–2 away loss against Albacete Balompié in the Copa del Rey (1–3 on aggregate). He was subsequently an unused substitute in the matches against Real Sociedad and Málaga CF, whilst finishing the season in Segunda División B with 13 appearances for the B-side.

On 28 November 2012, again in the domestic cup, Manquillo appeared in his second game with Atlético's main squad, playing 63 minutes in a 3–0 success at Real Jaén. On 6 December he featured in the 0–1 away defeat against FC Viktoria Plzeň in the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.

Manquillo's debut in La Liga came on 9 December 2012, coming on for Filipe Luís late into the second half of a 6–0 home routing of Deportivo de La Coruña. On 3 September of the following year he signed a contract extension with Atlético Madrid, keeping him at the Vicente Calderón Stadium until 2018.

On 11 February 2014, in the first half of the Spanish Cup semifinal clash against Real Madrid, Manquillo was involved in two incidents with Cristiano Ronaldo: in the early minutes, he conceded a penalty which the Portuguese converted in the first goal of an eventual 2–0 win (5–0 on aggregate). Later, after both went for an aerial challenge, he fell headfirst to the ground, going on to be sidelined for more than one month with a neck injury.

On 6 August 2014, Manquillo joined Liverpool in a two-year loan deal with an option to buy after his first season. He made his debut 11 days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 Premier League win over Southampton. On 16 September, he won a 93rd-minute penalty in the UEFA Champions League tie against PFC Ludogorets Razgrad, which Steven Gerrard converted to make the score 2–1 and win the match; the following weekend, in the third round of the Football League Cup, he converted his penalty shootout attempt against Middlesbrough as his team prevailed 14–13 following a 2–2 draw.

On 6 January 2015, Manquillo provided the assist for the first of Gerrard's two goals in a 2–1 win at A.F.C. Wimbledon in the FA Cup. After featuring in 16 matches during the first part of the season, he played just three times in 2015, never in the domestic league, and Atlético Madrid subsequently confirmed that the loan deal had been terminated.

On 27 July 2015, Manquillo joined Olympique de Marseille on a season-long loan with an option to buy. On 25 August of the following year, still owned by Atlético, he signed with English club Sunderland also for one season.

On 21 July 2017, Manquillo signed for Premier League club Newcastle United on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.

Manquillo earned 25 caps for Spain at youth level, including seven for the under-21s. He made his debut on 4 September 2014, starting in a 1–0 win in Hungary for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers.

<doc id="28988384" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28988384" title="Florian Lejeune">
Florian Lejeune

Florian Grégoire Claude Lejeune (; born 20 May 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Newcastle United. He is equally adept at playing as either a defender or a midfielder, but plays mostly as a centre back.

Lejeune joined Villarreal ahead of the 2011–12 season after spending one season with Agde in the Championnat de France amateur and two seasons with Istres in Ligue 2.

Lejeune was born in Paris and began his football career in July 1998 at the Centre de Formation de Paris, a youth sporting club designed to cater only to football players under the age of 19. After four months at the academy, he departed for Racing Club des Ternes, a local sporting club based in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Lejeune spent two years at the club and, in 2000, was signed by Racing Club de France. He spent the majority of his youth career at the club and, after a five-year stay, moved down south to join Béziers Méditerranée Cheminots, a sports club more known for its athletics department. With Béziers, Lejeune played in the "Championnat de France 14 ans Fédéraux" league.

After one year at Béziers, Lejeune joined the youth academy of Sète. After two years with the club, he signed an amateur contract with Adge, which was playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Lejeune spent the majority of the 2008–09 season playing on the club's reserve team. Towards the end of the campaign, he was called up to the senior team and made his amateur debut on 11 April 2009 appearing as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Gazélec Ajaccio. On 23 May, he made his first start in a 3–2 victory over Gap. The following week, Lejeune scored both goals for Agde in a 2–2 draw with Fréjus Saint-Raphaël.

In the summer of 2009, Lejeune joined Ligue 2 club Istres on trial. After impressing in two friendly matches, he was signed to a three-year professional contract and inserted onto the club's reserve team. Lejeune arrived at the club playing primarily in the defensive midfielder role, but ultimately switched to the centre back position. His positive play during the fall season with the reserves led to the player being called up to the senior team in January 2010. Lejeune made his professional debut on 19 January in a league match against Guingamp in a 0–0 draw with the player playing the entire match. Lejuene finished the campaign with 14 more appearances in the league playing the entire match in all of them.

Lejeune began the 2010–11 season as a starter and made his season debut in a 4–0 defeat to Ajaccio in the Coupe de la Ligue. In September, he was a surprise inclusion in the France under-20 team. His subsequent uprising into the spotlight and positive play with Istres led to the player being declared one of the best players in Ligue 2, despite only playing in a handful of matches. On 4 January 2011, French newspaper L'Equipe announced that Spanish club Real Madrid was monitoring Lejeune's progress. He was, subsequently, linked to a host of other clubs, notably English clubs Manchester United, Manchester City, and Arsenal and Italian clubs Napoli and Udinese with all the clubs reportedly likening him to former French international Laurent Blanc. However, despite the speculation, club president Francis Collado declared that he had not had official contact with any club linked to the player.

On 7 July 2011, French newspaper "L'Equipe" confirmed that Lejeune had reached an agreement with Spanish club Villarreal to sign a four-year contract. The transfer fee was priced at €1 million and Lejeune took his medical and signed his contract following the conclusion of his participation in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He was placed onto the club's second team. After appearing in seven matches with the B team, Lejeune made his senior team debut on 6 November 2011 appearing as a substitute in a 0–0 draw with Espanyol. In January 2013, he was loaned to Ligue 1 side Stade Brestois 29. It was announced in July 2013 that Lejeune would be loaned out to the newly relegated club for another year.

After his loan with Brest ended, Lejeune signed a two-year deal with Girona FC also in the second level. He was an undisputed first-choice for the Catalans, scoring his first goal on 8 February 2015, in a 1–0 win at CD Tenerife.

Lejeune finished the campaign with 40 appearances and five goals, as his side narrowly missed out promotion in the play-offs.

On 28 August 2015 Lejeune was transferred to Manchester City, being immediately loaned back to Girona for one year.

On 29 June 2016, Lejeune signed a four-year deal with SD Eibar.

On 4 July 2017, Lejeune joined Newcastle United on a five-year contract.

Yedlin is very close with his mother, Rebecca Yedlin, who had him when she was very young and is now a college sports instructor; his father has never been part of his life. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, Ira Nathan Yedlin, and step-grandmother, Vicki Walton. Yedlin has a sister Jenea who is three years younger than he is.

Yedlin began playing soccer at age four and learned while watching his uncle from the sideline. Seattle Sounders youth director Darren Sawatzky first saw him play at age 11 and later said that Yedlin was "an offensive player at the time, he was tricky, he had explosiveness and could run for days." Said Sounders FC sporting director Chris Henderson of Yedlin: "DeAndre has great quickness and speed. He reads the game well, keeps possession, but he's able to attack the flank and get crosses in."

Antonio Barreca

Antonio Barreca (born 18 March 1995) is an Italian professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Newcastle United, on loan from Ligue 1 club Monaco.

Born in Turin to Sicilian parents, he grew up in the Torino youth, where he played for each youth category up to the "Primavera". In 2013–14, he led the Primavera to the finals of the Campionato Primavera, lost on penalties to Chievo. Coinciding with Torino's injury problems that season he was regularly called up to the first team by Giampiero Ventura.

In his first season as a professional, Barreca was sent on loan to Cittadella in Serie B. He made his debut in the third round of Coppa Italia, lost 4–1 to Sassuolo. Barreca scored his first goal in Serie B on 15 November 2014 in a 5–2 away loss to Carpi.

Miguel Almirón

Miguel Ángel Almirón Rejala (born 10 February 1994) is a Paraguayan footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Newcastle United and the Paraguay national team.

He began his career at Cerro Porteño and transferred to Lanús in 2015. After winning the 2016 Argentine Primera División, he signed for Atlanta United FC for $8 million. He was named in the MLS Best XI for both of his seasons in Major League Soccer, as well as MLS Newcomer of the Year for 2017. After helping Atlanta to the MLS Cup 2018 he signed for Newcastle for £21 million, a club record and the highest fee for an MLS player.

Almirón made his international debut for Paraguay in 2015 and represented the country at the Copa América Centenario.

Almirón grew up in an impoverished family where his father worked 18-hour shifts as a security guard and his mother worked in a supermarket. The seven members of his household slept in three bedrooms, and he had to share a bed with his mother until he was 18.

Almirón began his career with Cerro Porteño.

In August 2015, Almirón signed for Club Atlético Lanús in the Argentine Primera División. Introduced slowly in his first season by Lanús manager Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Almirón came to the forefront the next season in the shortened 2016 Argentine Primera División under Jorge Almirón. Playing as an advanced central midfielder, Almirón was pivotal in Lanús' 2016 Argentine Primera División title win, scoring key goals against local rivals Banfield in the Clásico del Sur, and later in the final against San Lorenzo. A few months later, in August 2016, Almirón set-up the only goal in Lanús' Copa Bicentenario victory over Racing.

On 5 December 2016, Almirón signed with the new Major League Soccer expansion team Atlanta United. He joined as a "Young Designated Player" and Atlanta paid a transfer fee of around $8 million to Lanús. 

Almirón was an important figure in Atlanta United's first season, described as the "heartbeat" of the team by veteran teammate Jeff Larentowicz. On 12 March, Almirón scored his first goals for the club, notching a brace in the club's second game, a 6–1 victory over fellow MLS newcomers Minnesota United. He scored the second hat-trick in club history on 20 May against the Houston Dynamo, and scored two goals a week later against New York City FC. Almirón joined teammates Greg Garza and Michael Parkhurst in the MLS All-Star Game on 2 August, and topped the league's list of 24 players under the age of 24, released on 28 September. During the regular season, Almirón was named to seven Teams of the Week by Major League Soccer, and was named Player of the Week twice. At the end of the season, he was named to the league's Best XI and was named Newcomer of the Year.

In April 2018, Almirón was named MLS Player of the Month for his five goals and two assists as Atlanta went unbeaten with three wins and a draw. With 12 goals and 14 assists, he was again named in the MLS Best XI, alongside teammate Josef Martínez. Atlanta won MLS Cup 2018 against the Portland Timbers in only their second season of existence, and Almirón was named in the Team of the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs.

On 31 January 2019, Almirón joined Newcastle United for an undisclosed fee on a five-and-a-half year deal. The transfer fee is believed to be around £21 million, a club record fee, and a record for an MLS player.

He made his Premier League debut on 11 February in a 1–1 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers, playing the final 18 minutes in place of Christian Atsu. In jest, fans and media likened Almirón to Santiago Muñez, a fictional Newcastle player from the film "Goal!" who also moved from Latin America to St James' Park via the United States.

Almirón played for the Paraguay under-20 national team in the 2013 South American Youth Football Championship in Argentina, and was highly involved as his team finished second to Colombia. Later that year, he was called up for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, where Paraguay reached the last 16.

On 5 September 2015, Almirón made his senior international debut in a 3–2 friendly loss away to Chile, playing the final nine minutes in place of Jonathan Fabbro. Manager Ramón Díaz called him up the following May for the Copa América Centenario in the United States, where he started two matches in a group-stage exit.

Karl Darlow

Karl Darlow (born 8 October 1990) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Newcastle United. He is the grandson of former Wales international forward Ken Leek who was part of the Welsh 1958 World Cup squad. Darlow is a product of the Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest academies and spent time on loan at both Newport County and Walsall earlier in his career.

Weeks after being released by Aston Villa at the age of 16, Villa goalkeeping coach Eric Steele recommended Darlow to Forest and he was signed up to their academy. After impressive displays in the reserve team Darlow was awarded a space on the bench where he was present for the majority of the 2010–11 season. His debut was against Crystal Palace, on the last day of the 2010–11 season, as a substitute for Lee Camp. The Reds won the game 3–0, a result that secured them a play-off spot.

In March 2012, Darlow joined Newport County in the Conference National league on loan for a month. He made his first appearance for the club in a 1–0 home win against Gateshead.

On 21 September 2012, Darlow joined Walsall on loan for one month. While there, he signed a new three-year contract at parent club Forest, keeping him there until 2015. On 22 October, his loan with Walsall was extended until 22 December 2012, however Forest recalled him four days later owing to an injury to Forest goalkeeper Dimitar Evtimov.

He rejoined Walsall on 1 January 2013 on a one-month loan deal, with the view to extending the loan until the end of the season,

Darlow was recalled again on 10 January after first choice Lee Camp had been told he could leave the club on a free transfer. On 12 January 2013 he made his full Forest league debut in the 2–1 win over Peterborough, and ended with 20 league appearances for the club in the 2012–13 season. Darlow signed a new four-year contract on 23 August 2013 and established himself as manager Billy Davies's first-choice goalkeeper despite the summer arrival of Dorus de Vries.

On 9 August 2014, Darlow signed a long-term contract with Premier League club Newcastle United for an undisclosed fee. As part of the deal, he and teammate Jamaal Lascelles were loaned back to Nottingham Forest for the 2014–15 season.

He made his debut for Newcastle on 25 August 2015, in a League Cup fixture against Northampton Town which Newcastle won 4–1. He made his Premier League debut on 28 December 2015, against West Bromwich Albion as a late inclusion, after regular keeper Rob Elliot was forced to pull out due to illness; the Magpies lost the game 1–0 after Darlow let Darren Fletcher's header slip through his hands. Following a season-ending injury to Elliot while away on international duty, Darlow was forced to take over in net for Newcastle's final 8 matches as they attempted to avoid relegation. On 30 April 2016, Darlow saved a penalty from Yohan Cabaye, in a 1–0 Premier League win against Crystal Palace. Newcastle were relegated on 11 May following a victory for rivals Sunderland over Everton.

Darlow entered the 2016–17 season in a competition with summer signing Matz Sels to start the Championship season in goal, which Darlow lost. Darlow played in Newcastle's first two League Cup matches against Cheltenham Town and Wolverhampton, picking up clean sheets in both.

Darlow would compete with Rob Elliot during 2017–18 season as first choice Goalkeeper in the Premier League, with Darlow making 12 appearances, however both lost their place in the team when Martin Dúbravka was signed on loan in January 2018.

He started the 2018-19 season as 2nd choice behind number 1 goalkeeper Martin Dúbravka, Darlow made his first appearance of the season on 29 August 2018, when he started in the EFL Cup 3-1 defeat against his old side Nottingham Forest.

In addition to England, Darlow is eligible to represent Wales as his grandfather Ken Leek (a Wales international forward) was born in Ynysybwl. The Football Association of Wales confirmed Darlow had declined an invitation to join the Wales national football team squad for the friendly match versus Austria on 6 February 2013.

New Wales Manager Ryan Giggs approached Darlow in March 2018 to be part of his Wales squad, but Darlow advised he was currently concentrating on winning his place back in the Newcastle United starting lineup.

Christian Atsu

Christian Atsu Twasam (born 10 January 1992) is a Ghanaian professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Ghanaian national team. He primarily plays as a winger, although he has also been deployed as an attacking midfielder.

He began his career with Porto, also spending a season on loan at Rio Ave. In 2013, he was signed by Chelsea for £3.5 million, who subsequently loaned him to Vitesse Arnhem, Everton, AFC Bournemouth and Málaga. After spending the 2016–17 season on loan at Newcastle United, he completed a permanent transfer to the club in May 2017.

A full international with over 30 caps since his debut in 2012, Atsu has represented Ghana at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. He helped the team finish as runners-up at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, in which he also won Player of the Tournament and Goal of the Tournament.

Atsu was born in Ada Foah, Greater Accra Region.

Atsu arrived at Porto at the age of 17, finishing his football formation with the club. On 14 May 2011, he was called up by first-team manager André Villas-Boas for a Primeira Liga match against Marítimo, but he did not leave the bench.

As with teammate Kelvin, Atsu was sent on loan to fellow league side Rio Ave for the 2011–12 season. He made his debut in the competition on 28 August 2011, in a 0–1 home loss against Olhanense. On 16 December 2011, Atsu opened the score at Estádio da Luz against Benfica in the 24th minute, but the hosts eventually won it 5–1.

On 1 September 2013, Atsu agreed to join Chelsea on a five-year contract, for a reported £3.5 million, being immediately loaned to Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem, for the rest of the 2013–14 season.

On 6 October 2013, Atsu made his debut against Feyenoord as a substitute, replacing Kazaishvili in the 77th minute.

On 15 March 2015, in the match against Newcastle United, he came off the bench with 5 minutes remaining, and provided another an assist to fellow substitute Ross Barkley for Everton's third goal of a 3–0 home victory. Following Atsu's impact as a substitute in the above games, he was picked to start the second leg of a Europa League Round of 16 match away to Dynamo Kyiv on 19 March with regular right-winger Aaron Lennon cup-tied, with Everton leading 2–1 from the first leg.

On 29 May 2015, Atsu was loaned to newly promoted Premier League team Bournemouth for the upcoming season, with club Chief Executive Neill Blake calling the deal "a huge coup". He made his debut on 25 August in the second round of the League Cup, starting in a 4–0 win at Hartlepool United. Atsu's only other appearance was in the next round's victory at Preston North End; he did not feature in any Bournemouth matchday squad in the league and he was recalled from his loan by Chelsea on 1 January 2016.

The following year, he was in the Ghanaian squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa. He started the first match, a 2–2 draw against the DR Congo, and was a substitute in the following 1–0 win over Mali. He returned to the starting line-up in the last group match against Niger in Port Elizabeth, scoring the second goal of a 3–0 win which put his country into the quarter-finals as group winners.

Callum Roberts

Callum Michael Roberts is a marine conservation biologist, oceanographer, author, research scholar at the University of York, England.

Roberts' work examines the impact of human activity on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. In St. Lucia and Saba in the Caribbean, he has studied the effects of marine reserves closed to all fishing. His studies revealed both the scale of human impacts on the sea, and the means of protecting marine ecosystems from such effects. He is now working to gain a wider acceptance for marine reserves, including in Britain and Europe where he is advising fishermen on how to promote the concept within the industry and to politicians.

Callum has served on a US National Research Council Committee on Marine Protected Areas and has also been a member of the Marine Reserves Working Group, headed up by Jane Lubchenco, Steve Gaines and Steve Palumbi at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara. With this group he sought to develop a more robust theoretical underpinning for the design and implementation of marine reserves.

In parallel with work on reserves, Callum has also been active with the Coral Reef Fish Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN). With colleagues, he has developed global maps of the biodiversity distribution of reef fishes and other faunal groups. These maps have revealed that marine species are more at risk of global extinction than previously believed. Many have small geographic ranges and life history characteristics that render them vulnerable to extinction. However, the maps also show ways to prioritise conservation investment into areas where those resources could be most effective.

He was awarded a Pew fellowship in marine conservation in 2000 to tackle obstacles to implementing marine reserves, and in 2001 he was awarded a Hardy fellowship in conservation biology at Harvard University. Roberts is also an active supporter of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.

Since 2011 Roberts has written occasional opinion editorials for "The Guardian" on various marine conservation topics, including overfishing. He also appeared in the documentary film, The End of the Line (2009).

Roberts has also played a major role in creating a global database of coral reef fish biodiversity, in collaboration with members of the IUCN Coral Reef Fish Specialist Group, Chaired by Dr Don McAllister (Ocean Voice International) and Patty Almada-Villela. The project has significantly advanced understanding of the global patterns and determinants of marine biological diversity and provided urgently needed information to establish and guide conservation priorities for the tropical marine environment.

Achraf Lazaar

Achraf Lazaar (; born 22 January 1992) is a Moroccan international footballer, who plays as a left midfielder or left back for Sheffield Wednesday on loan from Newcastle United.

Born in Casablanca, Lazaar moved to Italy with his parents in 2003. He began his football career with Varese's youth system, at the age of fifteen. He went on to make his senior debut with the team in Serie B, in 2012, immediately emerging as one of the most interesting prospects from the small Lombardian team.

In January 2014, he was signed by top of Serie B Palermo, on loan with the option to make the move permanent by the end of the season. Initially signed as an understudy to the more experienced Fabio Daprelà, Lazaar immediately gained a starting spot thanks to his impressive performances. He was later permanently signed by Palermo and confirmed as part of the club's 2014–15 squad.

On 28 August 2016, Lazaar joined Newcastle United on a five-year deal. He made his debut in a 2–0 win in the EFL Cup against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 20 September 2016. His league debut took place when he came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Yoan Gouffran against Brentford on 15 October 2016. On 31 August 2017 Lazaar returned to Italy with a loan to Benevento. On 31 January 2019 Lazaar joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season.

Having been born in Morocco Lazaar is eligible to play for Morocco by birth, but until 2015 was ineligible to play for Italy despite having been raised there. He holds Italian citizenship since April 2015. He had originally never stated a clear preference to represent Morocco or Italy, instead declaring he would play for the first international team that showed a genuine interest in calling him up. His impressive Serie B performances with Palermo brought interest from the Moroccan national team, who called him up for a friendly match against Mozambique on 23 May 2014 and ended in a 4–0 win, during which he made his first senior international appearance.

Rolando Aarons

Rolando Aarons (born 16 November 1995) is a Jamaican born England U-20 international footballer who plays as a winger for Sheffield Wednesday on loan from Newcastle United.

Aarons joined Newcastle United in 2012 after being released by his home town club Bristol City. He made his reserve team debut on 8 February 2013 against Stoke City and scored in his second reserve game against Crystal Palace 17 days later.

Aarons travelled with the Newcastle squad to their game against Fulham. He was not included in the matchday squad as the Magpies lost 1–0. Reserves teammate Ľubomír Šatka also travelled with the squad for the first time.

On 1 April 2014, Aarons signed a professional contract with Newcastle United.

Aarons had an impressive pre-season prior to the 2014–15 season, scoring one goal and creating one assist in the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup against Bundesliga team Schalke. Shortly after, he was allocated the number 16 shirt. On 17 August 2014, he made his Premier League debut in their first match of the campaign, replacing Yoan Gouffran for the final 16 minutes of a 2–0 home defeat to Manchester City. He scored his first senior goal in the 3–3 draw with Crystal Palace on 30 August. He also set up teammate Mike Williamson for Newcastle's third goal in the same match, striking the post with his own effort. His contribution to the match described by "The Guardian" as "thrillingly incisive". Aarons came back from England U20 duty with a hamstring injury; scans in mid-September determined that it would take around six weeks for the injury to heal. On 29 October, Aarons returned from injury to score his second goal for the club in the fourth round of the League Cup, opening the scoring in Newcastle's 2–0 away victory over holders Manchester City. In early November, Aarons suffered a recurrence of his hamstring injury, ruling him out for another month.

In 2018, Aarons spent time out on loan with Hellas Verona and Slovan Liberec. After 13 appearances in all competitions for "Modrobílí", he returned to Newcastle in December 2018. On 31 January 2019, deadline day for the winter transfer window, he signed for Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season.

Aarons is eligible to represent either England or Jamaica at international level. In August 2014, he received his first call-up to the England U-20 team, marking his debut with the opening goal in a 6–0 friendly match win over Romania on 5 September. His club manager Alan Pardew confirmed that, despite interest from Jamaica, Aarons intended to pursue an international future within the England set-up.

Aarons operates on the outside of midfield or as a winger, usually on the left side. He is left-footed and known for his injections of pace and technical ability. He has been compared to Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling in his playing style and in his descent; both are Jamaican-born English players.

Aarons was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He migrated to England at the age of 5 to join his mother who was already living in the city of Bristol.. He is the cousin of Norwich City player Max Aarons.

Jack Colback

Jack Raymond Colback (born 24 October 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Nottingham Forest on loan from Newcastle United.

Colback began his career at Sunderland in 2008, having graduated from their academy, and broke into the team following loans at Ipswich Town of the Championship. After 115 Premier League appearances with Sunderland, his contract expired and he controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United. However, as of 11 August 2017, his future with Newcastle United is now in doubt after he was dropped from the 25-strong Premiership squad for the 2017–2018 season.

He played once for England at Under-20 level in 2009, and was called up for the senior squad for the first time in August 2014.

Colback was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear and joined the Sunderland academy at the age of 10. On 30 May 2008, Colback signed his first professional contract with the club.

After manager Steve Bruce announced his intention to loan out Colback, He signed for Ipswich Town on loan on 6 August 2009 on a deal that would expire in January 2010. He made his debut for Ipswich in a 3–3 draw with Shrewsbury Town after extra time in the League Cup, which was won 4–2 in a penalty shootout. His Football League debut came in a 2–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion after being introduced as a 46th minute substitute. He scored his first goal for Ipswich against Blackpool and scored against them again later on in the season in the FA Cup. His form meant the loan was extended until the end of the 2009–10 season in January 2010. He was voted Ipswich's Players' Player of the Season 2009–10.

He returned to Sunderland from a loan spell at Ipswich Town at the end of the 2009–10 Championship season and made his Premier League debut as a 76th-minute substitute against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was later sent off for two bookable offences, his debut lasting just nine minutes. He made his home debut against Colchester United in the League Cup on 24 August 2010 as a substitute. Colback went out on loan for a second spell at Ipswich, confirmed on 15 October and which lasted until 6 January when he returned to Sunderland.

Following his second loan spell at Ipswich, Colback returned to Sunderland in January 2011, and his appearances became more frequent. Colback started for Sunderland in their FA Cup 3rd Round defeat to Notts County on 8 January. He then came off the bench as Sunderland drew 1–1 against local rivals and the team Colback supported as a child, Newcastle United, on 16 January. He also appeared as a second-half substitute as Sunderland drew 0–0 with Arsenal on 5 March. Colback made his first Premier League start for Sunderland in their 2–0 defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April. Colback also started the following week as Sunderland beat Wigan Athletic 4–1. Colback had arguably his best performance in a Sunderland shirt in their 2–1 win at Bolton on 7 May 2011. Colback demonstrated his versatility by being deployed at left back in the final game of the season at West Ham.

Colback started the first game of the 2011–12 season, as Sunderland drew with Liverpool at Anfield. Sunderland drew 1–1 with Colback playing alongside Lee Cattermole in central midfield. On 26 December 2011, Colback scored his first goal for the club, a deflected effort, in 1–1 draw with Everton in the Premier League. Colback was deployed at left back on New Year's Day 2012 against Manchester City, and helped Sunderland to a surprise victory against the Premier League leaders. He again played at left back in Sunderland's 4–2 win at Wigan two days later, where he sustained a knee injury which ruled him out for a few weeks. On 5 January 2012, he signed a 2-year contract extension which expired in June 2014. Colback returned from injury as a substitute in Sunderland's 1–1 FA Cup draw with Middlesbrough, and returned to the starting line up in central midfield as the Black Cats beat Norwich 3–0 on 1 February. He scored his second goal for Sunderland with a left footed strike in the replay against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, as Sunderland won 2–1 after extra time to reach the fifth round.

The 2012–13 season saw Colback play regularly at left back due to injuries to Danny Rose, and right back in the Tyne-Wear derby as Sunderland defeated Newcastle 3–0. Following this, Colback is willing to play out in position, so it will help the club's solve their issue.

Following Rose's return to Tottenham, Colback began the 2013–14 season as Sunderland's first choice at left back, before being moved back into central midfield by Gus Poyet. On 28 December Colback scored a last minute goal in the fifth minute of injury time to salvage a 2–2 draw at Cardiff City. Colback made his 100th Premier League appearance on 1 January 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. He scored his second goal of the season on 1 February 2014, scoring the third goal in a 3–0 away win against Newcastle United. He scored his third goal of the season on 7 May 2014, scoring the first goal in a 2–0 home win to West Brom, to retain Sunderland's top division safety and relegating Norwich City to the Football League Championship.

With his contract about to expire at the end of the 2013–14 season, then-manager Paolo Di Canio urged to Colback to make a decision on his future at Sunderland. In November, Colback confirmed that talks of a new deal had started after initially rejecting a new contract in the summer under the management of Di Canio. Further talks over a new contract continued in February. In April, it was reported that Colback had turned down a new contract with the club and was set to depart upon the expiry of the contract. Several Premier League clubs made contract offers to sign Colback, but Sunderland refused to give up on Colback and hoped he would stay at the club.

On 9 June 2014, Colback signed for Newcastle United on a free transfer. He is the first player since Lionel Pérez in 1998 to transfer directly from Sunderland to Newcastle. As a supporter of Newcastle he admitted that due to the rivalry between the two clubs, Sunderland fans would "hate [him] for the rest of [his] life". Sunderland criticised Colback's move to Newcastle United, and described the transfer as leaving a "bitter taste". 

Colback made his competitive debut on 17 August as Newcastle began the season with a 2–0 defeat at home to Manchester City, playing the full 90 minutes. Colback scored his first goal for the club on 28 December in a 3–2 win over Everton, intercepting a Ross Barkley clearance to score Newcastle's third of the match. Four days later he scored in the second consecutive game, a 25-yard strike in a 3–3 draw against Burnley.

After becoming surplus to the needs of Rafa Benítez, Colback was targeted by Hull City for a loan deal in August 2017. Wolverhampton Wanderers as well as his former club Sunderland also expressed their desire to sign him on a loan deal. He turned down the offers due to geographical reasons and instead started training with the junior team. He was excluded from the club's official team photo for the 2017–18 season. Benítez justified his exclusion by saying that the club "had decided the squad before".

In January 2018, Colback joined Nottingham Forest on loan for the rest of the season. After having joined Forest, he accused Benítez of disrespecting him during his stint at the club and said that he was "treated more like a number than a human being".

On 20 July 2018, Colback returned to Nottingham Forest on a season-long loan with the option to make it permanent at the end of the season.

Colback has received one cap for the England under-20 team, he played in a 2–0 friendly win against Italy at Loftus Road in March 2009. He replaced Marc Albrighton in the 79th minute as a substitute.

On 28 August 2014, Colback received his first call-up to the senior team for the matches against Norway and Switzerland, but had to withdraw from the squad with a calf injury.

A former left-back, Colback is a left-footed central midfielder known for his versatility and efficient playing style; due to his technical skills, passing range and physique, he is neat in possession and rarely gives the ball away, which along with his athletic ability and defensive work-rate, allows him to link-up the defence and the attack effectively. Former England manager Roy Hodgson has likened his abilities to those of Andrea Pirlo.

Dwight Gayle

Dwight Devon Boyd Gayle (born 17 October 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for West Bromwich Albion of the Championship, on loan from club Newcastle United.

Gayle began his career in the Arsenal Academy. After being released as a teenager, over the following seasons he worked his way back up through the English football pyramid via stints at Ryan, Stansted, Bishop's Stortford, Dagenham & Redbridge and Peterborough United, before establishing himself in the Premier League with Crystal Palace. In 2016, he signed for Newcastle United.

Gayle was born in Walthamstow, London. He started his career in the academy of Arsenal but was released as a teenager. In 2007 he dropped down to the Essex Olympian Football League to play for Ryan, before moving up to join Essex Senior League club Stansted in 2009, where he went on to score 57 goals in the 2010–11 season.

In the summer of 2011, he signed for League Two club Dagenham & Redbridge. In August 2011, he was sent out to Bishop's Stortford on a season-long loan, during which he scored 29 goals in 42 appearances in the Conference North. He then signed a three-year professional contract with Dagenham & Redbridge in July 2012. He made his professional debut for the Daggers on 18 August 2012, in a 2–0 defeat to Cheltenham Town.

In November 2012, Gayle joined Peterborough United on loan the club had an option to make the move permanent in January 2013. His Peterborough debut came on 24 November as a 53rd-minute substitute for Saido Berahino in a 1–1 away draw with Ipswich Town. Gayle's first Peterborough goal was on 1 December: he picked up a poor backpass by Blackpool's Alex Baptiste to score what was only a consolation goal in a 4–1 home defeat. Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson said of Gayle: "He listens. He picks up things quickly, which is always a sign of a good player. He's going to be a really good player the boy".

On 24 December, after scoring five goals in six matches during his loan spell, Gayle agreed to sign permanently for Peterborough. He joined on 2 January 2013 on a four-and-a-half-year contract for a fee of £500,000 which could rise to £750,000. On 2 March, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–2 win against Blackburn Rovers.

On 3 July 2013, Gayle signed a four-year contract for newly promoted Premier League club Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee, reported as a club record £4.5 million His former club Dagenham & Redbridge received £1 million of the initial transfer fee plus 20% of any extra payments made due to a sell-on clause added when he signed for Peterborough United. He made his Palace debut playing 90 minutes in a home match against Tottenham Hotspur on 18 August in a 1–0 loss. On 31 August, Gayle scored his first goal for the club and his first in the Premier League by successfully converting a penalty against Sunderland after he was fouled by John O'Shea. On 5 October, he scored in a 3–1 defeat against Liverpool at Anfield. On 25 December, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 away win against Aston Villa in added time at the end of the match. In part due to injury, he found first team appearance opportunities limited for the remainder of the season. He returned towards the end of the season scoring two goals as Palace came back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 at home to Liverpool, which effectively ended their chances of the League title. 

On 26 August 2014, Gayle scored his first hat-trick for Crystal Palace, scoring three times in the first half to give Palace a 3–0 win over Walsall in the second round of the League Cup. Four days later, he scored his first goal of the Premier League season in the opening minute of a 3–3 draw at Newcastle United. On 23 November, Gayle scored in the home fixture against Liverpool for the second consecutive season as Palace defeated the Merseyside team 3–1. On 4 January, Gayle scored his first goal of 2015 in a 4–0 win over Dover Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup. He then scored three goals in the team's next two matches; a 2–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur and a 3–2 defeat of Burnley at Turf Moor. Gayle ended the season as top scorer in all competitions for Crystal Palace, despite, like the season before, struggling to hold down a consistent place in the starting eleven.

On 11 August 2015, Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill confirmed that Crystal Palace had accepted an undisclosed bid for Gayle. On 15 August, the transfer broke down as it was confirmed that Bristol City were no longer interested in signing Gayle. Gayle failed to hold down a regular first-team place, due to a series of injuries throughout the season. On 12 April 2016, Gayle signed a contract with Crystal Palace to keep him at the club until 2019. On 7 May 2016, the penultimate match of the season, Gayle scored two goals in a 2–1 victory over Stoke City to confirm Crystal Palace's safety in the Premier League. For the third season in a row Gayle, despite being unable to hold down a consistent place in the team, finished the season as top scorer in all competitions for Crystal Palace.

On 1 July 2016, Gayle signed a five-year contract for newly relegated Championship club Newcastle United. He made his debut for the club on 5 August, in a 1–0 defeat to Fulham. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Huddersfield Town. After having his spot kick saved, he scored from the rebound with his head. Gayle would score in the next two matches for Newcastle, with a brace in a 4–1 win over Reading, and the only goal of the game against Bristol City. It was not until over a month later when he found the net again, scoring a hat-trick against Norwich City, coming back from 3–1 down to win 4–3 in stoppage time. During October, Gayle scored braces in consecutive victories against Brentford and Barnsley, and on 20 November, Gayle scored another brace, this time against Leeds United. On 10 December, Gayle scored a hat-trick against Birmingham City. He would later score in matches against Burton Albion and Nottingham Forest, ending 2016 as the league's top scorer with 19 goals.

On 14 January 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 win over Brentford, and in doing so, became the first Newcastle player since Alan Shearer to score 20 league goals in a season. A few minutes later however, he sustained a hamstring injury, and had to be substituted off. This injury kept him out for the next four matches; he would make his return against Norwich City, and started the match against Aston Villa, but once again, had to leave the pitch early. It would become a recurring problem for Gayle, and on three occasions from February to April, he had to be substituted off in the first half. Unsurprisingly, his goal tally also suffered, as he scored twice during this period, netting against Huddersfield Town and Wigan Athletic. Gayle was absent for the rest of April, and made his return on the final day of the season, scoring in a 3–0 win over Barnsley, as Newcastle edged out Brighton & Hove Albion by a point to win the Championship.

On 18 November 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 4–1 loss to Manchester United. His goal was the first that the "Red Devils" had conceded from open play since 31 December 2016. On 2 December, Gayle again scored the opening goal, this time, in a 3–1 loss to Chelsea. On 9 December, Gayle was involved in both Newcastle goals in a 3–2 loss to Leicester City, assisting Joselu for the first and then scoring the equaliser. In the second half of the season, Gayle remained a first team regular, but only scored three more goals for Newcastle – a brace against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–2 draw on 24 February 2018, and a goal against Chelsea in a 3–0 win, the final day of the season.

On 6 August 2018, Gayle joined newly relegated Championship club West Bromwich Albion on a season-long loan deal from Newcastle. The deal included Salomón Rondón going the other way for the 2018–19 season. On 11 August, Gayle drew a foul from his former Newcastle teammate Tim Krul, now of Norwich City, with the resulting penalty scored by Jay Rodriguez. On 18 August, Gayle scored his first goal for the club, the fourth goal in a emphatic 7–1 win over Queens Park Rangers. He was also the fouled player for both of Rodriguez's penalties. During September, Gayle scored four times in three consecutive home match wins over Stoke City, Bristol City and Millwall. On 29 September, he scored the third goal, a free-kick, in a 3–2 win over Preston North End. For his performances, he was awarded with the Championship Player of the Month by the EFL. On 6 October, Gayle scored a brace in a 4–1 win over Reading.

On 14 February 2019, Gayle was suspended for two matches after accepting a charge of "successful deception of a match official", following an incident in the match against Nottingham Forest earlier that week when he "won" a late penalty enabling his team to take a 2–2 draw.

He is described as an "energetic, hardworking, pacey striker" and a "natural finisher".

Gayle is of Jamaican descent through his father.
