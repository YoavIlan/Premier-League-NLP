'''Robert Elliot''' (born 30 April 1986) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Elliot began his career with [[Erith Town F.C.|Erith Town]], before joining [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Charlton Athletic F.C. Academy|academy side]]. Whilst at Charlton, he was sent out on loan to [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], and also spent two loan spells at [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]], where he was nicknamed "The Dilsh". He would then go on to be Charlton's first choice goalkeeper for a number of seasons, until he joined Newcastle United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2011. Signed mainly as a back-up to [[Tim Krul]], he featured for the club sporadically, but became first choice in the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]] after Krul suffered a season-ending injury.

Through the origins of his father's family, Elliot became eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland national football team, and was first called up in 2013, making his debut the following year.

==Career==
===Charlton Athletic===
Born in [[Greenwich]], London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|5864|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot began his career with [[Non-league football|non-League]] side [[Erith Town F.C.|Erith Town]] before moving to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], the team he had supported as a child, when he was 17. After becoming a professional player with the Addicks in 2004, he was sent out on loan twice during the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season; first to [[Bishop's Stortford F.C.|Bishop's Stortford]] and then [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], where he made his [[Football League]] debut.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The [[2005–06 in English football|following season]], Elliot spent most of the season on loan at the [[Conference National]] club [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]], replacing fellow Charlton goalkeeper [[Darren Randolph]] who had been on loan at Stanley earlier in the year. He was part of the Accrington Stanley team which won promotion to the Football League as runaway champions, saving a vital [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in the match which guaranteed them promotion. He joined Stanley again on loan during the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season, but failed to displace [[Ian Dunbavin]] as the club's first choice goalkeeper. He was voted the best keeper of the past decade for Accrington Stanley in 2010 by numerous key figures for the club, including manager [[John Coleman (footballer, born 1962)|John Coleman]].

Back at Charlton, Elliot was considered to be behind [[Nicky Weaver]] and Darren Randolph for most of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season. After Randolph moved to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on loan Elliot was promoted to second choice. He made an unexpected debut for Charlton on 5 April 2008 after Weaver had been sent off in a match against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. He made his first start for Charlton in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in August 2008. During the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season, he displaced Weaver and established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper. A string of impressive performances contributing to a record breaking start to a season for Charlton in 2009–10 led to him signing a contract extension committing him to the club until 2012. In August 2011, Newcastle United made an offer of £100,000 which was rejected by Charlton.

===Newcastle United===
On 30 August 2011, Elliot signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a five-year contract, becoming their seventh summer signing. He then stated his desire to become first choice 'keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeper Elliot joins Newcastle |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12875_7139466,00.html |work=Sky Sports|publisher=BSkyB |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Newcastle debut on 20 September against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nott'm Forest 3–4 Newcastle (aet)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14893631.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the start of the [[2012–13 Premier League|2012–13 season]], Elliot changed his squad number from 35 to 21, which was previously worn by [[Fraser Forster]]. He made his second Newcastle appearance in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] on 20 September against [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maritimo 0–0 Newcastle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19582553|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third Newcastle appearance, and second of the season, came in a third round [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie away at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645229|title=Man Utd 2–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2013, and following an injury to [[Tim Krul]], Elliot made his first Premier League appearance for the Magpies, starting against Southampton in a 4–2 victory. During the match, after conceding a goal in the third minute, he then assisted a [[Papiss Cissé]] wonder goal in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21489679|title=Newcastle 4–2 Southampton|publisher=24 February 2013|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May, Elliot was sent off against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], following a second yellow card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22417786|title=QPR 2–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 May 2013|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot started the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]] as third choice 'keeper behind Krul and [[Karl Darlow]]. However, with Krul suffering a season-ending injury and Darlow still recovering from an ankle knock, Elliot was handed his first appearance of the season on 18 October at home to [[Norwich City F.C|Norwich City]], helping Newcastle to a 6–2 win, their first win of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34498802|title=Newcastle United 6–2 Norwich City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 October 2015|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game, it was revealed that Elliot had signed a 'new, long-term contract' back in January 2014. Elliot continued his run in the team, keeping successive clean sheets against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34623900|title=Newcastle United 0–0 Stoke City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2015|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bournemouth A.F.C.|Bournemouth]], the latter performance earning him the man-of-the-match award in a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34686457|title=Bournemouth 0–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 November 2015|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time Newcastle had kept two clean sheets in a row in two years and their first away win in ten months.

On 29 March 2016, whilst on international duty, Elliot sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and was ruled out of action for six months, ending his hopes of a place on the Republic of Ireland squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/newcastle-rob-elliot-euro-2016-republic-of-ireland|title=Newcastle's Rob Elliot in tears after knee injury rules out Euro 2016|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Hynter|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot returned to the Newcastle squad in December, but by then, Darlow had usurped him as the first choice 'keeper. For the next two months, he was not involved in the first team, but did make two appearances for the [[Newcastle United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserves]]. From February 2017 onwards, Elliot would be on the bench until 24 April, when Darlow himself was benched due to squad rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rob-elliot-emotional-injury-return-12942968|title=Rob Elliot on his emotional injury return, Benitez, and why Newcastle is not a 'stepping stone'|work=Evening Chronicle|first=Chris|last=Waugh|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot's first appearance of the season came in a 4–1 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39618289|title=Newcastle United 4–1 Preston North End|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 April 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April, he was named captain against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], keeping a clean sheet as Newcastle won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39663244|title=Cardiff City 0–2 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May, he again kept a clean sheet, as Newcastle beat [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] 3–0, edging out [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] by a point to win the [[2016–17 EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39760419|title=Newcastle United 3–0 Barnsley|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2017, Elliot's shirt number was changed from 21 to 1 in the 2017–18 squad number announcement, replacing [[Tim Krul]], who had been linked with a permanent move to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/201718-squad-numbers-confirmed|title=2017/18 squad numbers confirmed|publisher=Newcastle United F.C.|first=Tom|last=Easterby|date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot has yet to make an appearance for Newcastle in the 2018-19 season, having lost his place in the side to [[Martin Dubravka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-target-could-leave-2424377|title=Derby County ‘target’ could leave this month – Premier League boss has admitted|date=13 January 2019|publisher=Derby Telegraph|accessdate=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Elliot, who was born in England, is eligible for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] through his father's family from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and represented Ireland at [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nufcblog.com/2013/09/11/newcastle-player-has-international-ambitions/|title=Newcastle Player Has International Ambitions|publisher=NUFC Blog|author=Ed Harrison|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2013, Elliot received his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad as a replacement for the injured [[Darren Randolph]] for the games against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle Goalkeeper Elliot gets first Ireland call|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/newcastle-goalkeeper-elliot-gets-first-ireland-call-1.1551816 |work=The Irish Times|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot won his first international senior cap for the Republic of Ireland on 25 May 2014, in a 2–1 home loss to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/international/senior-men/103994-narrow-defeat-for-ireland-against-turkey.html|title=Republic of Ireland 1–2 Turkey|publisher=FAI.com|date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ciaran Clark''' (born 26 September 1989) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]]. Clark is naturally a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]], but is also able to operate as a [[Midfielder|central midfielder]] and at [[Leftback|left-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark is Villa's 'Mr Versatile' |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/aston-villa-fc/2011/01/04/ciaran-clark-is-villas-mr-versatile/ |work=[[Express &amp; Star]] |date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark captained [[England national football team|England]] at under-18, under-19 and under-20 level, but in October 2010 declared his ambition to play for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], the country of his parents' birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark confirms allegiance to Ireland |url=http://greenscene.me/2010/10/ciaran-clark-confirms-allegiance-to-ireland/ |publisher=GreenScene |date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up to the national team a month later for the friendly match against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and made his full debut against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 8 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_commentary/0,19764,11065_3344087,00.html?reloaded |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910104855/http://www.skysports.com/football/match_commentary/0,19764,11065_3344087,00.html?reloaded |dead-url=yes |archivedate=10 September 2012 |work=Sky Sports |title=FT: Republic of Ireland 3 Wales 0 |date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
====Early career====
Clark was born in [[Harrow, London]],&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and grew up in [[Sandy, Bedfordshire]]. He came through the [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|Aston Villa youth academy]] after joining at the age of eleven, and captained the academy U18 team to the [[2007–08 Premier Academy League]]—the academy's maiden league title. He was given a squad number for the 2008–09 season and named on the bench for Villa's [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]] match away at [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], but remained an unused substitute. He captained the reserves to the [[Premier Reserve League|Premier Reserve League South]] title and defeated PRL North winners Sunderland in the play-off final to win their first ever Reserve League trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RESERVES: VILLA 3–1 Sunderland |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1664139,00.html |date=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181207/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10265~1664139%2C00.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10 season====
Clark was included in the squads for the pre-season friendlies and the [[2009 Peace Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peace Cup squad |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1730353,00.html |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |date=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181216/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1730353,00.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2009, he made his debut in a 2–0 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. With [[Curtis Davies]] unavailable through injury, the 19-year-old was named in Villa's starting line-up, partnering [[Carlos Cuéllar]] in defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Fulham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8222321.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped keep a clean sheet and nearly marked his debut with a goal but sent his header inches wide. [[Garth Crooks]] of the [[BBC]] named the youngster in his team of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garth Crooks' team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/score_on_bbci/7631245.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the formidable partnership of new signings [[James Collins (footballer, born 1983)|James Collins]] and [[Richard Dunne]] limited him to the bench, he was tipped to break into the first team on a regular basis within several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Future is bright for Aston Villa youngsters, says Gordon Cowans |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/future-is-bright-for-aston-villa-youngsters-64815 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, he signed a contract extension until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark grateful for deal at Aston Villa |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2009/11/28/ciaran-clarke-grateful-for-deal-at-aston-villa-97319-25272783/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926181537/http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2009/11/28/ciaran-clarke-grateful-for-deal-at-aston-villa-97319-25272783/ |archivedate=26 September 2012 |work=Birmingham Mail |date=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
Clark started in the first two league games of the 2010–11 season: against [[West Ham United]], partnering Richard Dunne and keeping a clean sheet; then against [[Newcastle United]]. Clark was also handed a start in [[Gérard Houllier]]'s first match as new Villa manager, against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. He then started the match against local rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in midfield and continued in the role against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] due to the club's injury crisis. On 27 November 2010, Clark scored his first two goals for the club in a 4–2 defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at home. He scored a 91st-minute equaliser against Chelsea on 2 January 2011 to rescue a point. He also became the only player in Premier League history to be booked in six successive appearances within the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/298830089494343680 |title=Twitter / OptaJoe: 6 – The only player in PL history |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=25 November 2013}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
Clark scored his first FA Cup goal for the club against Bristol Rovers on 29 January 2012, with a solo run, including stepovers and a left-footed strike curled into the bottom corner.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====2012–13 season====
[[File:CiaranClark.JPG|thumb|upright|Clark playing for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 2013]]

On 25 August 2012, he was sent off against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a professional foul on [[Nikica Jelavić]]. On 3 September 2012, he scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. On 8 December 2012, after captaining Villa's youth and reserve sides, Clark was handed the armband for the senior side for the first time in a 0–0 draw at home to [[Stoke City F.C|Stoke]], after [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]] who had started the match as captain was replaced by [[Darren Bent]]. Three days later, Clark followed up his initial role as captain by performing the role again, this time for the full 90 minutes, in a 4–1 victory in the League Cup away at [[Norwich City F.C|Norwich]] which saw Villa qualify for the semi-finals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====2013–14 season====
Clark started Aston Villa's first game in their 3–1 away victory at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. After a dip in his form midway through Aston Villa's season, he was dropped to the bench as Lambert preferred a partnership between Ron Vlaar and fellow academy graduate, [[Nathan Baker]]. However, due to injury constantly plaguing Aston Villa's defence, along with consistently poor results, Clark still managed 28 appearances in a season that saw Villa finish 15th on 38 points. He accumulated nine yellow cards throughout the season.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In January 2014 during a training game Clark broke the right leg of his team-mate [[Libor Kozák]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2014/01/07/4527629/clark-backs-aston-villa-team-mate-kozak-to-come-back&lt;/ref&gt; The mishandled injury&lt;ref&gt;https://7500toholte.sbnation.com/2015/1/3/7486465/libor-kozak-aston-villa-injury-update-january-fitness-test&lt;/ref&gt; virtually ended Kozák's Premier League carrier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/aston-villa/362/blog/post/2749468/libor-kozak-waiting-for-second-chance-at-aston-villa&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Aston Villa began the 2014–15 season in good form with [[Paul Lambert]] re-introducing [[Alan Hutton]], forming a new look back four of Alan Hutton, [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Philippe Senderos]] and [[Aly Cissokho]]. When an injury ruled Vlaar out, Nathan Baker came into the back four, with Clark remaining on the bench. After injuries to both Baker and Senderos, Clark was called on along with [[Jores Okore]] and formed a solid partnership. Clark scored his first goal of the season from a free-kick curled in by [[Ashley Westwood (footballer, born 1990)|Ashley Westwood]] in a 2–1 home victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aston Villa 2–1 Leicester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30266471 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
On 3 August 2016, Newcastle announced that they have completed the signing of Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160803/united-complete-clark-capture_2281670_5776745 |title=United Complete Clark Capture |website=Newcastle United |date=3 August 2016 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having established himself alongside club captain [[Jamaal Lascelles]] in central defence, he scored his first goal for the club in a 6–0 win against [[Queens Park Rangers]] on 13 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37282510 |title=QPR 0–6 Newcastle |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to add further goals against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] while also helping Newcastle concede the joint-lowest number of goals in the division as they returned to the [[Premier League]] at the first time of asking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/england/championship/20162017/regular-season/r36638/tables/ |title=CHAMPIONSHIP |website=Soccerway |date=18 July 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===England===
Clark [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the [[England national under-19 football team|England U19]] team through qualification for the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|2008 European Championships]], playing in five out of the six qualifiers and scoring a goal. He missed out on the tournament through an ankle injury sustained during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Captain's Pride |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/Mens-u20s/news/2009/ciaran_clark_italy_reaction_010409 |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czechs' rivals aim to be class acts |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/news/newsid=732738.html |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being promoted to the [[England national under-20 football team|England U20s]], he was appointed captain and scored in only his second match, in a friendly against Italy on March 2008.

===Republic of Ireland===
[[File:FIFA WC-qualification 2014 - Austria vs Ireland 2013-09-10 - Ciaran Clark 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Clark playing for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in 2013]]

In late September 2010, [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) officials approached Clark about switching his allegiance. They sent [[Scout (association football)|scout]] and former [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland under-21]] manager, [[Don Givens]], to watch him in the match against Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republic of Ireland approach Ciaran Clark about switching his England allegiance |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/republic-of-ireland-approach-ciaran-clark-132582 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2010, it was reported that Clark had pledged his international future to the Irish national team as he qualified through his Irish parents. [[Richard Dunne]] played a role in convincing him and had spoken to FAI scouts about his eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark pledges international future to Ireland – after ringing endorsement from Richard Dunne |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ciaran-clark-pledges-international-future-132941 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2010, Clark was named in the Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark called up the Irish Squad |url=http://greenscene.me/2010/11/ciaran-clark-called-up-the-irish-squad/ |publisher=GreenScene |date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his debut on 8 February 2011 against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the [[Aviva Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0208/ireland_wales_carlingnationscup.html |title=Republic of Ireland 3–0 Wales |date=8 February 2011 |work=RTÉ Sport |accessdate=8 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211022530/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0208/ireland_wales_carlingnationscup.html |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2013, Clark scored his first goal for the Republic of Ireland, helping them to a 2–0 friendly victory against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref name="Republic of Ireland 2–0 Poland"&gt;{{cite news |title=Republic of Ireland 2–0 Poland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21313667 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Republic of Ireland's opening match at [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], Clark deflected a ball from [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] into his own net to level the scores. [[Wes Hoolahan]] had earlier given Ireland the lead but Clark's mishap saw them share the spoils as the match ended 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hytner |first=David (13 June 2016) |title=Republic of Ireland give up draw to Sweden with Ciaran Clark own goal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-sweden-euro-2016-match-report |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Newcastle United====
[[File:Paul Dummett 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Dummett playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2016]]

Dummett returned to Newcastle, and signed a one-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conor Newton and Paul Dummett have agreed new deals at Newcastle|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/8792260/Conor-Newton-and-Paul-Dummett-have-agreed-new-deals-at-Newcastle|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club as a substitute during a 4–0 defeat to [[Manchester City]] on the opening fixture of the 2013–14 season, coming on after a sending off of fellow defender [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]] and playing the full second half of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City 4–0 Newcastle United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23662898|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Newcastle in a 2–2 draw at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Goal For Dummett As 10-Man Newcastle Make Point|url=http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/86080/newcastle-united-2-2-liverpool-first-goal-for-dummett-as-10|publisher=Sky Tyne &amp; Wear|date=19 October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210607/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/86080/newcastle-united-2-2-liverpool-first-goal-for-dummett-as-10|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after scoring his goal for the club, Dummett put pen-to-paper on a new contract at Newcastle, signing a deal that could extend until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24504079|title=Newcastle United 2–2 Liverpool|first=|last=Mandeep Sanghera BBC Sport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the final day of the season, Dummett made a challenge on Liverpool forward [[Luis Suárez]]. Due to knee surgery which jeopardised Suárez's chances of playing at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], fans in his native Uruguay sent online death threats to Dummett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luis Suarez injury: Uruguay fans blame Newcastle's Paul Dummett|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27534751|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dummett started the [[2014–15 Newcastle United F.C. season|2014–15 season]] as Newcastle's first-choice left back, with [[Davide Santon]] injured and [[Massadio Haïdara]] on the bench. Dummett grabbed his second Magpies goal on 25 September 2014, scoring a late winner in extra-time against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace 2–3 Newcastle United (aet)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233096|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing alongside captain [[Fabricio Coloccini]] in the centre of defence, Dummett helped Newcastle keep clean sheets in victories over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester City vs. Newcastle United – 29 October 2014|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/10/29/england/league-cup/manchester-city-football-club/newcastle-united-football-club/1950095/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Bromwich Albion vs. Newcastle United – 9 November 2014|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/09/england/premier-league/west-bromwich-albion-football-club/newcastle-united-football-club/1703711/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 January 2016, Dummett scored a 90th minute equaliser against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a match that ended in a 3–3 draw at [[St James' Park]].

==International career==
Dummett qualifies to play for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] through his Welsh grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dummett profile|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Teams/PlayerProfile/0,,10278~58196,00.html|publisher=nufc.co.uk|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was capped at [[Wales national under-21 football team|under-21]] level for Wales.&lt;ref name="st mirren"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintmirren.net/pages/?p=15248 |title=Defender in on Loan |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |work=www.saintmirren.net |publisher=St Mirren FC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063134/http://www.saintmirren.net/pages/?p=15248 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut for Wales in the match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 4 June 2014, coming in as a substitute in the 83rd minute. Dummett played his second international match on 13 November 2015, again against the Netherlands, coming on for [[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]] in 65th minute. In May 2016, Dummett was listed for the 29-man squad for a pre-[[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] training camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gareth Bale left out of Wales' Euro 2016 training squad because of Champions League commitments|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-bale-left-out-wales-11307513|publisher=Wales Online|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dummett was among six players to be cut for the Euro 2016 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2016: Huddersfield Town transfer target makes Wales squad but Emyr Huws cut|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/news/euro-2016-huddersfield-town-transfer-11408209|publisher=The Huddersfield Examiner|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Wales manager [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] said that Dummett would no longer make himself available for international selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40049274 |title=Paul Dummett: Newcastle United defender quits Wales duty |first=Owain |last=Llyr |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to the national team in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45342667|title=Hal Robson-Kanu: Wales forward retires from international football|date=29 August 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|via=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swansea City===
[[File:Jonjo Shelvey 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Shelvey playing for [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] 2015]]

On 3 July 2013, Shelvey signed a four-year contract with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], for an initial transfer fee of £5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=SwaTransfer&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23143710 |title=Swansea City complete £5m Jonjo Shelvey signing |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on 16 September 2013, in a 2–2 draw with former club Liverpool, also assisting teammate [[Michu]]'s goal, but was partly responsible for both Liverpool goals, giving the ball away to [[Daniel Sturridge]] and [[Victor Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24012560 "Swansea 2–2 Liverpool"]. BBC Sport. 16 September 2013. Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a goal on 26 April 2014 in a 4–1 defeat of Aston Villa; from [[Brad Guzan]]'s clearance, Shelvey "controlled the ball with one touch before propelling it over the back-pedalling American's head and into the net."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/swansea-4-aston-villa-1-match-report-jonjo-shelvey-wonder-goal-all-but-secures-swans-premier-league-status-9291624.html |title=Swansea 4 Aston Villa 1 match report: Jonjo Shelvey's superb strike stuns Villa |first=Andrew |last=Gwilym |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=26 April 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelvey was sent off in a goalless draw at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 November 2014, by getting two bookings. First, he kicked the ball away in the 24th minute, then in the 72nd minute, he blocked [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]]'s run, resulting in the second booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanghera |first=Mandeep |title=Everton 0–0 Swansea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29768011 |accessdate=2 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, he caught Liverpool's [[Emre Can]] with his arm during a 4–1 away defeat. Although referee [[Andre Marriner]] did not punish him for it, [[the Football Association]] later gave Shelvey a four-match suspension for violent conduct, with one match having been added to the suspension because of his previous dismissal against Everton. He claimed that the act was unintentional and personally apologised to Can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Swansea midfielder gets four-match ban for Can clash |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30634753 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the Liverpool match, Swansea manager [[Garry Monk]] criticised Shelvey's disciplinary record, telling him to "wise up" and put a stop to an accumulation of yellow cards earned through "laziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Swansea midfielder must wise up, says Garry Monk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30620866 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Shelvey signed a new, four-year deal with the Swans, which would have kept him at the club until the summer of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shelvey signs new Swans contract |url=https://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/jonjo-shelvey-signs-new-swansea-city-contract-2533483.aspx |publisher=Swansea City A.F.C. |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2016, following a shock 3–2 defeat to League Two team [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the [[2015–16 FA Cup#Third Round Proper|FA Cup]], Shelvey appeared to become embroiled in a row with one Swansea fan and then appeared to invite the man to meet him outside. Manager [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]] responded stating "we expect more from Jonjo, it is as simple as that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey in angry confrontation with fan after cup defeat |url=http://www.espnfc.com/swansea-city/story/2784480/swansea-jonjo-shelvey-in-angry-confrontation-with-fan |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=12 January 2016 |date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===

While Newcastle were on a training break in [[La Manga]] on 20 February, manager [[Steve McClaren]] announced that Shelvey had been made the team's captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=James |title=Newcastle announce shock new captain |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/645920/Newcastle-Jonjo-Shelvey-captain-Premier-League-news |accessdate=20 February 2016 |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served the role as [[Fabricio Coloccini]] stayed out through a calf injury, and said that he wanted to help the club avoid relegation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Stand-in Newcastle United captain wants to inspire safety push |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35729286 |accessdate=11 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were unsuccessful in that aim.

Shelvey scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 27 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37138687 |title=Newcastle 2–0 Brighton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Shelvey was banned for five matches after being found guilty of using racially abusive language towards [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] player, [[Romain Saïss]], in a match on 17 September 2016. He was also fined £100,000 and ordered to attend a Football Association education course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38366883 |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Newcastle United midfielder handed five-game racial abuse ban |date=20 December 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 47 appearances and scored 5 goals in [[2016–17 Newcastle United F.C. season|2016–17]]&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; as Newcastle were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=1502 |title=Championship: 2016/17: Latest table |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the new season, Shelvey changed his squad number from 12 to 8. On 13 August 2017, in Newcastle United's first match back in the Premier League against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Shelvey was sent off three minutes into the second half of the match, for stamping on Tottenham midfielder [[Dele Alli]]. Newcastle would go on to lose the match 2–0, with Shelvey later apologising for his violent conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/10987259/jonjo-shelvey-has-apologised-for-red-card-says-rafa-benitez |title=Jonjo Shelvey has apologised for red card, says Rafa Benitez |publisher=Sky Sports |date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

===Youth===
Shelvey captained the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16s]] as they won the [[2007 Victory Shield]] scoring three goals in three matches. He played a key role in the Montaigu Tournament, which England won for the first time in seven years, playing in all four matches and scoring a free kick in the final against France.{{cn|date=April 2017}} In October 2008, he made his debut for the [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17s]] and scored in a 7–0 win over [[Estonia national youth football team|Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lions hit seven |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/Mens-u17s/news/2009/u17s_estonia_report |publisher=The Football Association |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's senior manager [[Roy Hodgson]] claimed that Shelvey missed the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] because he was "reticent" about playing at that level following his senior international debut. Shelvey responded by saying that he had been told by under-21 manager [[Gareth Southgate]] that he would not feature in that squad, and claimed that if he had ever refused international duty he would have faced the wrath of his father.&lt;ref name=snub&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey denies snubbing England U21 duty |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/9976526/jonjo-shelvey-denies-snubbing-england-u21-duty |accessdate=12 January 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2015, Shelvey was selected to start for England for the first time in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match against San Marino, becoming the first man to be capped for England whilst playing for Swansea City.

==Personal life==
Shelvey was born in [[Romford]], London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/players/jonjo-shelvey-228577/ |title=Jonjo Shelvey |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in a council flat in [[Harold Hill]]. Due to crime in the neighbourhood, he bought his sister a home in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] when she became pregnant. His older brother George was, according to Shelvey, a better footballer, but his career was ruined by drinking and partying.&lt;ref name=rough&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Stuart |title=Jonjo Shelvey: 'Growing up it was rough, people were getting stabbed' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/20/jonjo-shelvey-swansea-city-interview |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelvey fell down a staircase as a baby, one of several childhood traumas which he believes could have caused the [[alopecia]] which caused his hair loss. He was prescribed a cream and told to sleep in a woolly hat for a month in order to combat it, but abandoned treatment because of the discomfort it caused, and said of his baldness, "If you don't like it, don't talk to me".&lt;ref name=rough/&gt; Shelvey has supported youngsters who share his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Richman |first=Darren |title=Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey gives young alopecia sufferer day to remember after receiving heartfelt letter |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/11125000/Swanseas-Jonjo-Shelvey-gives-young-alopecia-sufferer-day-to-remember-after-receiving-heartfelt-letter.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Shelvey married Daisy Evans, formerly of the pop group [[S Club 8]]. Comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] performed at the event. The couple have a daughter, born the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey marries Daisy Evans in lavish ceremony with helicopter entrance and Jimmy Carr show |url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Jonjo-Shelvey-marries-Daisy-Evans-lavish-ceremony/story-26743379-detail/story.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=South Wales Evening Post |location=Swansea |date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his marriage, Shelvey advertised for a live-in chef, who would receive an annual salary of £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graves |first=Steve |title=Jonjo Shelvey advertises for chef on £65,000 a year |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jonjo-shelvey-advertises-chef-65000-9657234 |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that his family responsibilities and new diet would improve his professional behaviour.&lt;ref name=snub/&gt;

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in [[Caracas]], Rondón's sporting idols growing up were [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Michael Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/brazil/205/blog/post/2840087/ronaldo-deserves-more-credit-as-one-of-the-games-best|title=Ronaldo deserves more credit as one of the game's greatest players|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last1=Smith|first1=Rory|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the [[Venezuelan Primera División]] at the age of 17, appearing for [[Aragua FC]] against [[Carabobo FC]] on 8 October 2006; on 8 April of the following year he scored his first goal(s) for the club, in a 2–2 draw against [[Caracas FC]].

===Las Palmas===
In the summer of 2008, Rondón was signed by [[UD Las Palmas]] in Spain, and made his official debut on 5 October in a 1–2 away loss against [[Deportivo Alavés]] for the [[Segunda División]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/2a_division/cronica/es/desarrollo/1172328.html|title=El Alavés remontó con toda justicia en Mendizorroza|trans-title=Alavés came back from behind in Mendizorroza justly|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=es|date=5 October 2008|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost one year after his arrival, on 2 September 2009, he netted his first goal, in a [[Copa del Rey]] [[2009–10 Copa del Rey|match]] against [[Cádiz CF]] – becoming the youngest foreign player to ever score for the club, at the age of 19 years, 11 months and 17 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laprovincia.es/deportes/2009/09/04/gol-extranjero-joven/255281.html|title=El gol extranjero más joven|trans-title=Youngest foreign goal|newspaper=La Provincia|language=es|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;– and finished [[2009–10 Segunda División|the season]] with ten goals in 36 games, as the [[Canary Islands]] side narrowly avoided relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malagacf/2011/02/20/rondon-anatomia-goleador/402699.html|title=Rondón: anatomía de un goleador|trans-title=Rondón: anatomy of a scorer|newspaper=La Opinión de Málaga|language=es|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Málaga===
[[File:Salomon rondon malaga caracas.jpg|thumb|left|Rondón says farewell to [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], a week before joining [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]]]]
On 19 July 2010, [[Málaga CF]] signed Rondón for a record [[Euro|€]]3.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listandalucia.com/news/sport/transfer-record-for-malaga-football-club/ Transfer record for Malaga Football Club]; List Andalucia, 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the [[Andalusia]]ns exactly two months later, in a 1–2 home defeat against [[Sevilla FC]] in [[La Liga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/match/48603/malaga-vs-sevilla/report Report: Malaga vs Sevilla]; [[Goal (website)|Goal]], 20 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he opened the score in a 2–0 win at [[Getafe CF]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2010/09/23/2133624/primera-liga-round-up-sevilla-held-at-home-malaga-stun Primera Liga round-up: Sevilla held at home, Malaga stun Getafe, Villarreal edge past Deportivo La Coruna]; Goal, 23 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; adding a third the following week in a 2–3 home loss to [[Villarreal CF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=302129&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;cc=3888 First-half thriller]; [[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]], 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2011, Rondón contributed with one goal as Málaga came from behind at home to defeat [[Hércules CF]] 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=301948&amp;cc=5739 The Beast boosts Malaga hopes]; ESPN Soccernet, 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That was his 13th goal of [[2010–11 La Liga|the campaign]], with which he surpassed the record of goals from a Venezuelan footballer in the Spanish top flight previously held by [[Juan Arango]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eltiempo.com.ve/deportes/futbol/salomon-rondon-anoto-e-hizo-historia/20166|title=Salomón Rondón anotó e hizo historia|trans-title=Salomón Rondón scored and made history|newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Anzoátegui)|El Tiempo]]|language=es|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=2 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504085755/http://eltiempo.com.ve/deportes/futbol/salomon-rondon-anoto-e-hizo-historia/20166|archivedate=4 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team finally escaped relegation, with the player finishing as their top scorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malaga.eldesmarque.com/malaga-cf/52060-sandro-y-el-exclusivo-club-de-los-10|title=Sandro y el exclusivo club de los 10|trans-title=Sandro and the exclusive 10 club|publisher=El Desmarque|language=es|date=20 April 2017|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rondón started [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12]] on the [[Substitute (association football)|substitutes]] bench. He eventually beat competition from ageing [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/05/18/futbol/equipos/malaga/1337360836.html|title=Rondón, "orgulloso y encantado" de haber aprendido de Van Nistelrooy|trans-title=Rondón, "proud and delighted" for having learned from Van Nistelrooy|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=es|date=18 May 2012|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; again finishing as Málaga's best scorer – this included goals in narrow home wins against [[RCD Espanyol]] (2–1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=323932&amp;cc=5739 Malaga end losing run]; ESPN Soccernet, 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Levante UD]] (1–0),&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=323790&amp;cc=5739 Rondon boosts Boquerones]; ESPN Soccernet, 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a brace against [[Rayo Vallecano]] (4–2 success, also at [[La Rosaleda Stadium]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=323774&amp;cc=5739 Rondon doubles up in Malaga win]; ESPN Soccernet, 22 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rubin Kazan===
[[File:Соломон Рондон.jpg|190px|thumb|Rondón before a [[2012-13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]]]

He previously played for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]]. He joined Newcastle United in 2016.

Born and raised in England, Ritchie qualified to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] through his Scottish father. He made his senior international debut on 25 March 2015, in a friendly match against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].

==Club career==
===Portsmouth===
Ritchie had been involved in Portsmouth's academy since he turned 13, previously playing football locally in Gosport, starting at the age of six.&lt;ref name="Ritchie in dream land"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie in dream land|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-in-dream-land-1-1299296|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing his first professional contract with the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&amp;qs_article_id=1315 |title=Portsmouth Football Club :: News |publisher=Portsmouthfc.co.uk |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728052519/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&amp;qs_article_id=1315 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a positive 2008–09 pre-season campaign, including a [[hat-trick]] in a 4–1 victory over hometown club [[Gosport Borough F.C.|Gosport Borough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3967462,00.html |title=Sky Sports &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Pompey see off Gosport |publisher=Skysports.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the match, Ritchie said scoring a hat-trick was 'unreal'.&lt;ref name="Ritchie in dream land"/&gt;

He went on loan to Swindon Town in 2010 but due to Portsmouth's mounting injury list, he was recalled in March and was named on the bench for their 2–0 [[Premier League]] loss at the hands of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] after making four appearances for Swindon. On 14 April, he made his League debut for Portsmouth in the game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. He played 79 minutes but was then substituted for [[Frédéric Piquionne]]. After the match, Ritchie admits making his Portsmouth debut was a dream come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie: It was a dream come true|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-it-was-a-dream-come-true-1-1249529|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=15 February 2010|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, with Portsmouth's relegation from the Premier League confirmed, he signed a new two-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie set for Pompey stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6221148/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2010–11 Football League|2010–11]] season, Ritchie was handed the number 5 shirt and was selected in Portsmouth's starting XI for their first match of the season at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8881422.stm|title=BBC Sport – Football – Coventry 2–0 Portsmouth|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon found himself out of the Portsmouth line-up and, with the club having disbanded its reserve team, manager [[Steve Cotterill]] agreed to loan out the player for fitness reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/frattonlatest/Cotterill-Ritchie-has-a-Blues.6574341.jp|title=Cotterill: Ritchie has a Blues future|website=www.portsmouth.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge====
Ritchie played reserve and academy football at Pompey until late September and continued to impress until he was taken on a one-month loan deal by [[Football League Two|League Two]] club [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/7636244.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; My Club &amp;#124; Dagenham &amp; Redbridge &amp;#124; Daggers bring in Ritchie on loan |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Football League debut against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 27 September 2008, coming on as a late substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7626803.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Dag &amp; Red 1–1 Rotherham |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie scored on his first competitive start for the ''Daggers'' in a 2–0 win over [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7639346.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Rochdale 0–2 Dag &amp; Red |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=4 October 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again in his next match, a 2–0 win over [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7646415.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Dag &amp; Red 2–0 Barnet |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritchie also made clear his wishes to extend the loan deal until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1782_4344933,00.html |title=Daggers boss keen on Ritchie stay |publisher=Teamtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021174750/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0%2C16368%2C1782_4344933%2C00.html |archivedate=21 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagenham announced on 30 December that the player would remain with the club until the end of the current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/7804737.stm | work=BBC News | title=Daggers extend Ritchie loan spell | date=30 December 2008 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His impressive performances saw him rewarded with a new two-year deal at Portsmouth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_5262599,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Pompey offer Ritchie new deal | date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their Young Player of the Season Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hat-trick of honours for Johnson|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/hat-trick-of-honours-for-johnson-1-1232220|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=20 May 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Notts County====
On 28 July 2009, it was reported that [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], were in talks with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] over a six-figure fee for his services, believed to be £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magpies plan Ritchie raid|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/5459759/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 July 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2009, Ritchie signed on loan until 31 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magpies swoop for Ritchie|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/5530180/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 September 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although County wanted to extend his loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie wants Magpies stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/5700069/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan to Swindon and permanent basis===
After [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] failed to secure Ritchie's services on a permanent deal during the transfer window, it was announced on 11 February 2010 that [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] had signed the midfielder on loan for the remainder of the [[2009–10 in English football|season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/headlines/5001709.BREAKING_NEWS__Town_land_Ritchie/ Town land Ritchie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213213509/http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/headlines/5001709.BREAKING_NEWS__Town_land_Ritchie/ |date=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 February against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] after coming on for [[Danny Ward (English footballer)|Danny Ward]] after 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8496999.stm | work=BBC News | title=Swindon 4–1 Stockport | date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making a brief appearance for Pompey on 4 October, Ritchie was loaned again to Swindon Town, on a one-month deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Ritchie-Loaned-To-Swindon-1459.aspx Ritchie loaned to Swindon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007070023/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Ritchie-Loaned-To-Swindon-1459.aspx |date=7 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later the deal was extended to two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/9101408.stm|title=BBC Sport – Football – Swindon extend loan of Portsmouth winger Matt Ritchie|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2011, Swindon Town signed Ritchie on a two-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He added to his tally with goals against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] in a 3–2 loss, a 4–1 loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], a 1–1 draw with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and a 2–1 loss against Notts County. Despite Swindon Town being relegated to League Two, Ritchie was named the Robins' Player of the Season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie wins Swindon Town's player of the year|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/9474972.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 May 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under manager [[Paolo Di Canio]] in League Two, he retained his first team place in the starting eleven and scoring form with ten goals that season. During the season, Ritchie was linked with League One clubs, with the likes of Bournemouth interested in signing the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bournemouth fail in bid for Swindon Town's Matt Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15870897|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bournemouth's bid for him was rejected, manager Di Canio said that he was worth about £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Di Canio puts £2m price tag on Swindon Town's Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15895163|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March, he won the Football League Two Player of the Year for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie scoops League Two honour|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-scoops-league-two-honour-1-3616685|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With teammate [[Paul Caddis]] he was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1112&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17797832 |title=Arsenal striker Robin van Persie named PFA Player of the Year |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of a new season in League One, Swindon turned down a £900,000 offer from a League One club for Ritchie, insisting he would be sold for £2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swindon Town turn down new bid for Matt Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18883762|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie signs Swindon Town contract extension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19523943|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 January 2013, Ritchie signed for AFC Bournemouth on a three-and-a-half year deal for £400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21265257|title=Matt Ritchie: Bournemouth sign Swindon Town winger|date=30 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8457035/League-One-Bournemouth-have-signed-winger-Matt-Ritchie-from-Swindon "League One: Bournemouth have signed winger Matt Ritchie from Swindon"] Sky Sports. 30 January 2013. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Swindon Town, he said that he was surprised to leave the club and that he had left with a "heavy heart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie: Swindon exit saddens Bournemouth winger|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21286981|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Di Canio claimed that the club sold Ritchie behind his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio: Swindon Town manager 'considers future'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21300099|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut on 2 February in a 3–0 win over [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]. Ritchie scored his first goal for his new team on 23 March in a 4–1 win over [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. That win was the first of an eight match run of successive wins, including a brace for Ritchie in a 3–1 victory over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], that culminated in clinching promotion to the Championship.&lt;ref name="sb1213" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchener|first1=Mark|title=Bournemouth 3 – 1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133176|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 April 2015|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a key performer for Bournemouth during the 2014–15 season. His form helped the side to top the Championship and won him international recognition with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. By April, he had scored 11 goals and provided 13 assists for his team. Ritchie's form saw him voted the [[Football League]]'s best player in a poll by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cusick|first1=Aiden|title=Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie Tops Four Four Two's Football League Top 50 Poll|url=http://www.90min.com/posts/2017319-bournemouth-s-matt-ritchie-tops-fourfourtwo-s-football-league-top-50-poll|publisher=90 Minutes|accessdate=3 April 2015|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2015, he scored his first ever goal in the [[Premier League]], coming on for Bournemouth in a 2–0 home win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bournemouth 2–0 Sunderland|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34191881|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2015, Ritchie scored his team's only goal of the game after just 1 minute, in Bournemouth's 5–1 drubbing by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bournemouth 1–5 Tottenham Hotspur|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34564964|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2016, Ritchie signed a five-year contract with newly relegated [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], becoming the third signing under manager [[Rafael Benítez]].&lt;ref name="Ritchie Signs On At St. James' Park"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160701/ritchie-signs-on-at-st-james-park_2281670_5696102 | title=Ritchie Signs On At St. James' Park | publisher=Newcastle United | date=1 July 2016 | accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], playing the full 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36921094|title=Fulham 1–0 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal, a penalty, came two matches later in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37030439|title=Newcastle United 4–1 Reading|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2016|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, Ritchie would become the club's designated penalty taker and had a 100% success rate in all competitions, converting from the spot five times. He was involved in two penalty related incidents over the course of the season. On 25 October, he refused to hand the ball to [[Aleksandar Mitrović (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrović]], tucking it under his shirt, before scoring the third goal in a 6–0 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37686639|title=Newcastle United 6–0 Preston North End|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 2017, against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]], Ritchie scored a penalty, but it was not awarded due to encroachment by [[Dwight Gayle]]. However, referee [[Keith Stroud]] awarded a direct free kick to Burton, rather than allowing Ritchie to retake the penalty. Ultimately, it did not matter as he scored the winner anyway, to keep Newcastle in the promotion hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39426682|title=Newcastle 1–0 Burton Albion|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie's season was ended by suspension, when he argued with a match official after a home draw with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39735735|title=Matt Ritchie: Newcastle United winger misses rest of season through suspension|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 April 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie scored sixteen goals in all competitions, with only Gayle having netted more than the Scotsman.

On 26 August, Ritchie assisted [[Ciaran Clark]] for the second goal of the match, as Newcastle got their first win of the season, beating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40984016|title=Newcastle United 3–0 West Ham United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 August 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then credited with the assists for the goals scored by [[Jamaal Lascelles]] and [[Christian Atsu]] in wins over [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41139095|title=Swansea City 0–1 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 September 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41210052|title=Newcastle United 2–1 Stoke City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 September 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November, he assisted both Newcastle goals from set-pieces in a 2–2 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41210052|title=West Bromwich Albion 2–2 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 November 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the season, Ritchie scored three times, all in home wins over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42934988|title=Newcastle United 1–0 Manchester United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43267239|title=Newcastle United 3–0 Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43686474|title=Newcastle United 2–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 April 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2018, Ritchie set up [[Joselu]] for the equaliser, in a 2–1 home loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45067372|title=Newcastle United 1–2 Tottenham Hotspur|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken off in the second half, much to his disapproval; his emotional outburst on the bench was captured on television cameras, and was discussed on the following night's "2 Good 2 Bad" segment on ''[[Match of the Day 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/11/matt-ritchie-goes-ballistic-newcastle-bench-subbed-off-tottenham-7827421|title=Matt Ritchie goes ballistic on Newcastle bench after being subbed off against Tottenham|work=Metro|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November, Ritchie assisted Clark for the second goal of the match in a 2–1 away win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], although in the second half, he missed a sitter from two yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46256914|title=Burnley 1–2 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 November 2018|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Under [[FIFA eligibility rules]], Ritchie was eligible for the national teams of England, where he was born and raised, and Scotland, his father's native land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31909618|title=Matt Ritchie: Bournemouth winger's joy at Scotland call-up|date=16 March 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2015, he was called up to the [[Scotland national football team]] for a friendly against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification|qualifier]] against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]]. Ritchie made his debut against Northern Ireland on 25 March at [[Hampden Park]], and took the 85th-minute corner which set up [[Christophe Berra]]'s header for the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scotland 1–0 Northern Ireland|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/31917339|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June he scored his first international goal, a 20-yard strike which was the only goal of a friendly victory over [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] at [[Easter Road]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamont|first1=Alasdair|title=Scotland 1–0 Qatar|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32926060|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came in a European Championship qualifier against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at Hampden Park on 8 October 2015, for which he won "Goal of the Year" award from the [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish FA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14133215.Matt_Ritchie_wins_Scotland_Goal_of_the_Year/?ref=rss |title=AFC Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie wins Scotland Goal of the Year from Scottish FA |work=Daily Echo |publisher= |date=9 December 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Dúbravka''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈmaɾtin ˈduːbɾaʊ̯ka}}; born 15 February 1989) is a Slovakian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Slovakia national football team]].

==Early life==
As a child, Dúbravka enjoyed playing ice hockey as well as football, and could have moved into the former sport were it not for a leg injury he sustained when he was five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/13/martin-dubravka-interview-hyperactive-ice-hockey-goalkeeper |title= Exclusive Martin Dubravka interview: From hyperactive ice-hockey goalkeeper to Newcastle cult hero – via a freak machete injury |work= Daily Telegraph |first=Luke |last=Edwards |date= 13 April 2018 |accessdate= 13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Dúbravka made his senior team debut in a 5–2 home win against [[MFK Dubnica|Dubnica]] on 26 May 2009. In the [[2009–10 Slovak Superliga|next season]] he played 26 [[Slovak Superliga|Corgoň Liga]] games, finishing as a league champion. He became a first choice after the transfer of [[Dušan Perniš]] in January 2010. He qualified with Žilina to the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]] and played all 6 group games. He kept a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Play-off round|play-off round]] against [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]].&lt;ref name=joinsparta&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fotbal.idnes.cz/liberecky-brankar-martin-dubravka-prestoupil-do-sparty-pjw-/fotbal.aspx?c=A170612_162313_fotbal_min|title=Další nováček ve Spartě, z Liberce přichází brankář Dúbravka|language=cs|work=idnes.cz|date=12 June 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2014, he signed a 3½ year deal with the [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Esbjerg fB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2048808.html|title=Esbjerg bring in Dúbravka from Žilina|first=|last=uefa.com|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dúbravka joined [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] of the [[Czech First League]] in July 2016 on a one-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/fotbal-liberec-dubravka-0s0-/fot_pohary.aspx?c=A160728_2262637_fot_pohary_tof|title=Liberec ulovil brankáře Dúbravku.

===Newcastle United===
In January 2018, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest in Dúbravka, initially offering Sparta Prague a [[loan (sports)|loan]] for €500,000, with an option to sign in the summer for €4.5 million. He finally joined the [[Premier League]] side  on 31 January 2018, the final day of the [[List of English football transfers winter 2017–18|winter transfer window]] on a half-year loan deal, due to expire at the end of [[2017–18 Newcastle United F.C. season|2017–18 season]]. According to isport.cz, he joined the club for €2 million, with an option to sign in the summer for €4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sport.aktuality.sk/c/318531/newcastle-a-sparta-sa-dohodli-dubravka-mieri-do-premier-league/|title=Newcastle a Sparta sa dohodli, Dúbravka mieri do Premier League!|language=sk|author=SPORT.SK, s.r.o. &amp; Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia a.s.|publisher=|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He made his debut on 11 February, playing a pivotal role and keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He became the sixteenth Slovak player and only the second Slovak goalkeeper, after [[Ján Mucha]], to start in a Premier League fixture. After a very successful loan spell, he signed permanently for Newcastle on 30 May for an undisclosed fee of around 5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/magpies-confirm-permanent-d%C3%BAbravka-deal{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2019 in [[Durham, England|Durham]], Dúbravka was recognised as the Player of the Year 2018 by [[Football Writers' Association|North East Football Writers' Association]], joing the alikes of [[Alan Shearer]], [[Kevin Keegan]] or [[Shay Given]]. He became the 7th goalkeeper to win the award, in its 39 seasons. Dúbravka stated that he was happy to win the award because "amazing players have won this trophy before". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/dubravka-receives-north-east-football-writers-association-player-of-the-year-award|title=Dúbravka receives North East Football Writers' Association player of the year award|website=Newcastle United Football Club|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Dúbravka, a former [[Slovakia national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|under-21]] national player, was selected for the [[Slovakia national football team]] for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] home game against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

Dúbravka made his national team debut against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] on 23 May 2014 (2–0 win).&lt;ref name=debrep&gt;[http://sport.sme.sk/c/7213206/slovensko-vyhralo-nad-ciernou-horou-20-kozakovi-chybala-atmosfera.html Slovensko vyhralo nad Čiernou Horou 2:0, Kozákovi chýbala atmosféra], SME.sk, retrieved 25. 5. 2014 {{sk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, he played his first full game for the national team, having played 45 minutes in both of his previous matches. While he was benched against [[Uganda national football team|Uganda]] (1–3 loss), on 12 January he was fielded in an unofficial friendly match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. Slovakia lost the game 0–6, despite only trailing 0–1 at half time. This match also marked the first time Dúbravka conceded in the national team and he was also Slovak [[captain (association football)|captain]] for the game, being the most experienced with international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportinak.sk/online-prenos-pripravny-zapas-futbal--slovensko---uganda|title=Prípravný futbalový zápas: Slovensko prehralo s Ugandou 1:3|language=sk|website=www.sportinak.sk|date=8 January 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportinak.sk/online-prenos-pripravny-zapas-futbal--slovensko---svedsko-teraz|title=Slováci prehrali so Švédskom 0:6. To je niečo strašné, hovorí Kozák|language=sk|website=www.sportinak.sk|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his competitive debut in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]], against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] (2–1 win), on 10 June 2017, when the preferred goalkeeper in the qualification, [[Matúš Kozáčik]], was unavailable due to injury. He however achieved his first competitive clean sheet on 1 September in a home [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|qualifier]] against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. Slovakia won thanks to an 81st-minute goal by [[Adam Nemec]]. Just as in the previous [[cap (sport)|cap]], Dúbravka was chosen due to a prolonged injury of Kozáčik. After Kozáčik's return to the squad, Dúbravka remained preferred for the remaining matches against [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. In the match against Scotland, Dúbravka made a series of saves before he was finally beaten by an [[own goal]] from [[Martin Škrtel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/scotland/41525121 |title=Scotland still in it after dramatic late win over Slovakia |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Tom |last=English |date=6 October 2017 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ján Kozák's resignation incident===
Dúbravka was nominated for a double fixture against [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on 13 October and 16 October 2018, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportdnes.sk/futbal/trener-kozak-nominoval-na-cesko-a-svedsko-aj-skrtela-ci-pekarika-pozvanku-dostali-a-mladici-zo/|title=Tréner Kozák nominoval na Česko a Švédsko aj Škrtela či Pekaríka, pozvánku dostali a mladíci zo Serie A|work=SportDnes.sk|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the entirety of both games, but was also involved in an incident, that had led to resignation of [[Ján Kozák (footballer, born 1954)|Ján Kozák]], then Slovakia's longest-serving and most successful coach, who introduced him to the national team.

Dúbravka violated the code of conduct of national team players, along with [[Michal Šulla]], [[Norbert Gyömbér]], [[Ľubomír Šatka]], [[Milan Škriniar]], [[Vladimír Weiss (footballer, born 1989)|Vladimír Weiss]] and [[Stanislav Lobotka]]. On the night of 13 October 2018, after loss in Slovakia's second [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]] fixture and a derby match against Czech Republic (1–2), they left the hotel and went out, missed the bedtime and violated the wellness policy, regarding regeneration and rehabilitation. They were allegedly discovered by Ján Kozák at about midnight, admitting to the incident and apologising during the next day.
Ján Kozák resigned from the national team during the afternoon of 14 October, revealing the details of his decision in a press conference on 18 October, to avoid distractions during the preparation for the fixture against Sweden, that was managed by his former assistant [[Štefan Tarkovič]] on a caretaker basis. Kozák cited his inability to work with such squad under these conditions as the primary reason, as almost a third of the team was concerned, including players, those Kozák described as crucial, with Dúbravka being a part of this group. President of [[Slovak Football Association|SFZ]], Ján Kováčik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for future nominations and performances in the national team during the upcoming qualification cycle. During the press conference, Kozák also revealed that Dúbravka had claimed "difficult times at Newcastle" as one of the reasons for his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sport.sme.sk/c/20940265/online-jan-kozak-o-rezignacii-tlacova-konferencia.html|title=Kozák vymenoval hráčov, ktorí po zápase s Českom porušili večierku (minúta po minúte)|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=sport.sme.sk|access-date=2018-10-18|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October, SFZ published Dúbravka's official statement. He acknowledged that missing the bedtime was a violation, but maintained that the rest was within norms. He accepted any sanctions and stressed that the conduct was not aimed against Kozák, commenting that he regrets that Kozák didn't accept an apology from the trespassers. He also stated that Kozák's resignation surprised him, because of the good relations within the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futbalsfz.sk/sr-a-hraci|title=SR A – Všetci siedmi reprezentanti sa ospravedlňujú: Mrzí nás to, bola to chyba a budeme za ňu niesť následky|last=zväz|first=Slovenský futbalový|website=www.futbalsfz.sk|language=sk|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Dúbravka is a third-generation [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]: his father and grandfather also played in the position.&lt;ref name = "reluctant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reluctant keeper Martin Dubravka makes right impression at Newcastle|first=Louise|last=Taylor|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=24 February 2018|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/martin-dubravka-goalkeeper-newcastle-bournemouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dúbravka has been dubbed the "quintessential sweeper-keeper" due to his "outstanding footwork" and he believes "in modern football the keeper's almost like a [[libero (football)|libero]]. You need to play with the ball, not just kick it long".&lt;ref name="reluctant" /&gt;

Louise Taylor of ''[[The Guardian]]'' christened Dúbravka the "reluctant keeper" after he admitted his favourite position to play is [[right winger (association football)|right wing]]; he sometimes plays as an outfielder in training and coaching staff have suggested that he switch to a [[midfielder|midfield]] role.&lt;ref name="reluctant" /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Yoshinori Muto'''|武藤 嘉紀|Mutō Yoshinori|born 15 July 1992}} is a Japanese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Japan national football team|Japan national team]] as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].

He started his career with [[J1 League]] club [[FC Tokyo]] in 2013 who he played with for three seasons. In May 2015, he signed for German club [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] where he amassed 72 appearances and scored 23 goals before moving to [[Premier League]] club Newcastle United in August 2018.

==Club career==
===FC Tokyo===
As a child, Muto joined FC Tokyo's youth system, where he kept developing until 2010. He then enrolled in the Faculty of Economics of [[Keio University]] but kept playing football, for Keio's team. Despite an injury which sidelined him, in his first season with Keio he won the "Rookie of the Year" title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://keispo.org/wordpress/?p=5171 |title=【ソッカー男子】開幕前取材、第3弾　武藤嘉紀編 |publisher=Keio Sports Press |date=3 May 2011 |language=japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, FC Tokyo included him in their roster as a "Special Designated Player",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=武藤嘉紀選手（慶應義塾大学）「ＪＦＡ・Ｊリーグ特別指定選手」承認のお知らせ |url=http://www.fctokyo.co.jp/?p=148757 |language=japanese |publisher=FC Tokyo |date=26 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302075513/http://www.fctokyo.co.jp/?p=148757 |archivedate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an option that allows J-League clubs to field university players without a professional contract. However, he got on the pitch just once, at the end of a match in July 2013.

In 2014, he signed his first professional contract with FC Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=武藤嘉紀選手(慶應義塾大学)来季新加入内定のお知らせ |url=http://www.fctokyo.co.jp/?p=180838 |language=japanese |date=12 December 2013 |publisher=FC Tokyo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222115444/http://www.fctokyo.co.jp/?p=180838 |archivedate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was given the shirt number 14. Coach Massimo Ficcadenti decided to use him from the first league round and, at the end of the season, Muto reached 33 appearances and scored 13 goals, matching the top debut record in the Japanese first division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea scout out Muto |url=http://www.marca.com/en/2015/04/09/en/football/international_football/1428615427.html |newspaper=Marca |date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he was part of the J-League's Best XI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Orlowitz |title=Yasuhito Endo awarded 2014 J-League MVP; FC Tokyo and Gamba Osaka spearhead Best XI |url=http://footballchannel.asia/2014/12/09/post1086/ |publisher=Football Channel Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muto graduated from Keio University in March 2015, and the following month was subject to a bid by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yoshinori Muto: Chelsea make bid for Japanese striker |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32230300 |accessdate=9 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he was elected as March's MVP (Player of the Month) in the J-League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muto named Coca-Cola MVP winners in March |url=http://www.jleague.jp/en/news/20150411-03.html |accessdate=11 April 2015 |work=JLeague Sport |date=11 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024121/http://www.jleague.jp/en/news/20150411-03.html |archivedate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainz 05===
On 30 May 2015, Muto joined [[Bundesliga]] club [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] on a four-year contract until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mainz 05 sign Yoshinori Muto |url=http://www.mainz05.de/mainz05/en/aktuell/news/news-detail/article/mainz-05-verpflichtet-yoshinori-muto.html |accessdate=30 May 2015 |publisher=Mainz 05 |date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October 2015, he scored a [[hat-trick]] for the first time in his career and also became the second Japanese player after [[Naohiro Takahara]] to score a hat-trick in the Bundesliga, in his team's 3–3 draw against [[FC Augsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2015/11/01/soccer/muto-hits-hat-trick-mainz-draw/#.VjhdKNLhBRB |title=Muto hits hat-trick in Mainz draw |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=1 November 2015 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
[[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] announced on 27 July 2018 that they had reached a deal to sign Muto, pending him being granted a [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|UK work permit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-confirm-sealed-transfer-14962597.amp |title=Newcastle United confirm they have all but sealed the transfer of Yoshinori Muto |newspaper=Evening Chronicle |first=Lee |last=Ryder |date=27 July 2018 |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted the work permit on 2 August, officially becoming a Newcastle player on a four-year contract as part of a £9.5&amp;nbsp;million fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/11457570/yoshinori-muto-completes-newcastle-move-after-work-permit-granted |title=Yoshinori Muto signs for Newcastle after work permit granted |publisher=Sky Sports |first=James |last=Dale |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muto’s first goal for Newcastle came in a 3–2 away loss to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/oct/06/manchester-united-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Muto made his debut for [[Japan national football team|Japan]] on 5 September 2014 in a 2–0 friendly defeat to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] at the [[Sapporo Dome]], replacing [[Yusuke Minagawa]] after 58 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan 0–2 Uruguay: Cavani on target for Celeste |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/japan-vs-uruguay/1837187/report |accessdate=9 April 2015 |publisher=Goal.com |date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later at [[Yokohama]]'s [[Nissan Stadium (Yokohama)|Nissan Stadium]] he scored his first international goal, coming on as a half-time substitute against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] and scoring the first goal of a 2–2 draw six minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=West |first=Harry |title=Japan 2–2 Venezuela: Kawashima mistake costs Aguirre maiden win |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/japan-vs-venezuela/1837189/report |accessdate=10 April 2015 |publisher=Goal.com |date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a substitute, Muto played all of Japan's matches at the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] in Australia, ending with defeat to the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asian Cup 2015: UAE complete shock win over Japan to reach semi-final after penalty shootout dramatics |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-23/uae-japan-asian-cup/6043964 |accessdate=9 April 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Madrid]], Manquillo started playing football with hometown's [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] alongside his twin brother Víctor, a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].

On 28 November 2012, again in [[2012–13 Copa del Rey|the domestic cup]], Manquillo appeared in his second game with Atlético's main squad, playing 63 minutes in a 3–0 success at [[Real Jaén]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atleticofans.com/15413/copa-del-rey-atletico-1-0-real-jaen/ Copa del Rey: Atlético 1–0 Real Jaén]; Atlético Fans, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December he featured in the 0–1 away defeat against [[FC Viktoria Plzeň]] in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000356/match=2010014/postmatch/report/index.html#plzen+atletico Plzeň pip Atlético to take top spot]; UEFA, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, in the first half of the [[2013–14 Copa del Rey|Spanish Cup semifinal clash]] against Real Madrid, Manquillo was involved in two incidents with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]: in the early minutes, he conceded a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] which the Portuguese converted in the first goal of an eventual 2–0 win (5–0 on aggregate). Later, after both went for an aerial challenge, he fell headfirst to the ground,&lt;ref&gt;[http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/387326/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739 Ronaldo spot on for Real]; ESPN FC, 11 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2014/02/13/futbol/equipos/atletico/1392285700.html Manquillo estuvo al borde de la tragedia (Manquillo neared tragedy)]; Marca, 13 February 2014 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; going on to be sidelined for more than one month with a [[neck]] injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2014/02/12/futbol/equipos/atletico/1392215993.html Manquillo, un mes con collarín (Manquillo, one month with neck brace)]; Marca, 12 February 2014 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Lejeune was born in [[Paris]] and began his football career in July 1998 at the Centre de Formation de Paris, a youth sporting club designed to cater only to football players under the age of 19.&lt;ref name ="lejeune_career"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fff.fr/selections/20ans/actualite/535214.shtml | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | title = Nouveau cap pour Florian Lejeune |language = French |date = 8 October 2010 | accessdate = 7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cffp.fr/accueilcffp_histoireducffp.htm | title = Histoire du CFFP | date =  | accessdate = 7 January 2011 | publisher = Centre de Formation de Paris | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720210916/http://www.cffp.fr/accueilcffp_histoireducffp.htm | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After four months at the academy, he departed for Racing Club des Ternes, a local sporting club based in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name ="lejeune_career"/&gt; Lejeune spent two years at the club and, in 2000, was signed by [[Racing Levallois 92|Racing Club de France]].&lt;ref name="lejeune_career"/&gt; He spent the majority of his youth career at the club and, after a five-year stay, moved down south to join Béziers Méditerranée Cheminots, a [[sports club]] more known for its [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] department. With Béziers, Lejeune played in the ''Championnat de France 14 ans Fédéraux'' league.

After one year at Béziers, Lejeune joined the youth academy of [[FC Sète|Sète]]. After two years with the club, he signed an amateur contract with [[RCO Agde|Adge]], which was playing in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of [[Football in France|French football]].&lt;ref name ="lejeune_sport"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sport24.com/football/ligue-2/actualites/lejeune-prenom-florian-434141/ | publisher = Sport24 | title = Lejeune, prénom Florian |language = French |date = 3 December 2010 | accessdate = 7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lejeune spent the majority of the [[2008–09 Championnat de France amateur|2008–09 season]] playing on the club's reserve team. Towards the end of the campaign, he was called up to the senior team and made his amateur debut on 11 April 2009 appearing as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat to [[Gazélec Ajaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foot-national.com/fiche-match-football-11507.html | title = Agde v.

===Istres===
In the summer of 2009, Lejeune joined [[Ligue 2]] club [[FC Istres|Istres]] on trial. After impressing in two [[Exhibition match|friendly matches]], he was signed to a three-year professional contract and inserted onto the club's reserve team.&lt;ref name ="lejeune_sport"/&gt; Lejeune arrived at the club playing primarily in the [[Midfielder|defensive midfielder]] role, but ultimately switched to the centre back position.&lt;ref name ="lejeune_career"/&gt; His positive play during the fall season with the reserves led to the player being called up to the senior team in January 2010. Lejeune made his professional debut on 19 January in a league match against [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] in a 0–0 draw with the player playing the entire match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/53317 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Guingamp v.

Yedlin began playing soccer at age four and learned while watching his uncle from the sideline.

Said [[Seattle Sounders FC|Sounders FC]] sporting director Chris Henderson of Yedlin: "DeAndre has great quickness and speed. He reads the game well, keeps possession, but he's able to attack the flank and get crosses in."&lt;ref name="U23-interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundersu23.com/home/636607.html |title=Getting to Know the U-23's – DeAndre Yedlin |publisher=Seattle Sounders FC U-23 |year=2012 |accessdate=June 4, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306052125/http://www.soundersu23.com/home/636607.html|archivedate=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career at [[Cerro Porteño]] and transferred to [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] in 2015. After winning the [[2016 Argentine Primera División]], he signed for [[Atlanta United FC]] for $8 million. He was named in the [[MLS Best XI]] for both of his seasons in [[Major League Soccer]], as well as [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award|MLS Newcomer of the Year]] for 2017.

Almirón made his international debut for Paraguay in 2015 and represented the country at the [[Copa América Centenario]].

==Early life==

==International career==

'''Callum Michael Roberts''' is a [[marine conservation]] biologist, [[oceanographer]], author, research scholar at the [[University of York]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Callum Roberts|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/environment/our-staff/callum-roberts/|publisher=The University of York|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Roberts' work examines the [[Ecological footprint|impact]] of human activity on [[marine ecosystem]]s, particularly [[coral reef]]s. In [[St. Lucia]] and [[Saba]] in the Caribbean, he has studied the effects of [[marine reserve]]s closed to all fishing. His studies revealed both the scale of human impacts on the sea, and the means of protecting [[marine ecosystem]]s from such effects. He is now working to gain a wider acceptance for marine reserves, including in Britain and Europe where he is advising [[fishermen]] on how to promote the concept within the [[Fishing industry|industry]] and to politicians.

Callum has served on a US National Research Council Committee on [[United States National System of Marine Protected Areas|Marine Protected Areas]] and has also been a member of the Marine Reserves Working Group, headed up by Jane Lubchenco, Steve Gaines and [[Steve Palumbi]] at the [[National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]] in Santa Barbara. With this group he sought to develop a more robust theoretical underpinning for the design and implementation of marine reserves.

In parallel with work on reserves, Callum has also been active with the Coral Reef Fish Specialist Group of the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN). With colleagues, he has developed global maps of the [[biodiversity]] [[Range (biology)|distribution]] of [[Coral reef fish|reef fish]]es and other faunal groups. These maps have revealed that marine species are more at risk of global [[extinction]] than previously believed. Many have small geographic ranges and life history characteristics that render them vulnerable to extinction. However, the maps also show ways to prioritise conservation investment into areas where those resources could be most effective.

He was awarded a Pew fellowship in marine conservation in 2000 to tackle obstacles to implementing marine reserves, and in 2001 he was awarded a Hardy fellowship in conservation biology at [[Harvard University]].  Roberts is also an active supporter of the [[Deep Sea Conservation Coalition]].

Since 2011 Roberts has written occasional opinion editorials for ''The Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Callum Roberts|url = https://www.theguardian.com/profile/callum-roberts|website = the Guardian|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on various marine conservation topics, including [[overfishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = We knew fish catches were too high. But it’s much worse than we thought|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/21/fish-stocks-low-worse-official-figures|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2016-01-21|access-date = 2016-01-22|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the documentary film, [[The End of the Line (2009 film)|The End of the Line]] (2009).

==IUCN Database==

Roberts has also played a major role in creating a global database of coral reef fish biodiversity, in collaboration with members of the IUCN Coral Reef Fish Specialist Group, Chaired by Dr Don McAllister (Ocean Voice International) and Patty Almada-Villela. The project has significantly advanced understanding of the global patterns and determinants of marine biological diversity and provided urgently needed information to establish and guide conservation priorities for the tropical [[Ecosystem|marine environment]].

==Other work==

1999-2003. Member of editorial board of Conservation Biology, published by the Society for Conservation Biology.

1997-2000. Member of Editorial board of journal Animal Conservation, published by Cambridge University Press.

1996. Senior editor of the proceedings of a symposium: “Marine reserves: Function and Design” held at the 8th International Coral Reef Symposium, Panama.

1991-1996. Co-editor of Reef Encounter, Newsletter of the International Society for Reef Studies.

'''Achraf Lazaar''' ({{lang-ar|أشرف لزعر}}; born 22 January 1992) is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] international [[association football|footballer]], who plays as a [[Midfielder|left midfielder]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]] for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C. |Sheffield Wednesday]] on loan from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

== Club career ==
Born in [[Casablanca]], Lazaar moved to [[Italy]] with his parents in 2003. He began his football career with [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]]'s youth system, at the age of fifteen. He went on to make his senior debut with the team in [[Serie B]], in 2012, immediately emerging as one of the most interesting prospects from the small Lombardian team.&lt;ref name="varesenews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www3.varesenews.it/sport/lazaar-corre-per-realizzare-il-suo-sogno-in-a-con-il-varese-271601.html |publisher=Varese News |accessdate=13 March 2014 |language=Italian |title=Lazaar corre per realizzare il suo sogno: "In A con il Varese" |trans-title=Lazaar runs to realize his dream: "Serie A with Varese" |date=19 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119001952/http://www3.varesenews.it/sport/lazaar-corre-per-realizzare-il-suo-sogno-in-a-con-il-varese-271601.html |archive-date=2014-01-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, he was signed by top of [[Serie B]] [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]], on loan with the option to make the move permanent by the end of the season. Initially signed as an understudy to the more experienced [[Fabio Daprelà]], Lazaar immediately gained a starting spot thanks to his impressive performances. He was later permanently signed by Palermo and confirmed as part of the club's 2014–15 squad.

On 28 August 2016, Lazaar joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a five-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160828/lazaar-arrives-at-st-james-park_2281670_5842956|title=Lazaar Arrives At St. James' Park|work=nufc.co.uk|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 2–0 win in the [[EFL Cup]] against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 20 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37346000| title=Newcastle 2–0 Wolves |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His league debut took place when he came on as a 72nd-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Yoan Gouffran]] against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 15 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37593786|title=Newcastle United 3–1 Brentford|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 October 2016|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August 2017 Lazaar returned to Italy with a loan to [[Benevento Calcio|Benevento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/it/notizie/calciomercato-benevento-doppio-colpo-sul-gong-lazaar-e/1cizvuefcrs1t1dsv80ixj7grd|title=Lazaar a Benevento|website=goal.com|date=31 August 2017|accessdate= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2019 Lazaar joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/11624144/west-brom-loan-jacob-murphy-sheffield-wednesday-sign-rolando-aarons-and-achraf-lazaar|title=Newcastle Trio Leave On Loan|publisher=Sky Sports|date=31 January 2019|accessdate= 31 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
Having been born in Morocco Lazaar is eligible to play for [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] by birth, but until 2015 was ineligible to play for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] despite having been raised there. He holds [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizenship]] since April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediagol.it/palermo/palermo-achraf-lazaar-acquisisce-cittadinanza-italiana/|title=Palermo: Achraf Lazaar acquisisce cittadinanza italiana|date=2015-04-07|work=Mediagol|access-date=2018-05-28|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.varesenews.it/2015/05/lazaar-diventa-cittadino-italiano/367620/|title=Lazaar diventa cittadino italiano|date=2015-05-04|work=VareseNews|access-date=2018-05-28|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had originally never stated a clear preference to represent  Morocco or Italy, instead declaring he would play for the first international team that showed a genuine interest in calling him up.&lt;ref name="varesenews" /&gt; His impressive [[Serie B]] performances with Palermo brought interest from the Moroccan national team, who called him up for a friendly match against [[Mozambique national football team|Mozambique]] on 23 May 2014 and ended in a 4–0 win, during which he made his first senior international appearance.

On 1 April 2014, Aarons signed a professional contract with Newcastle United.&lt;ref name="Aarons Pens Professional Deal"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20140401/aarons-pens-professional-deal_2281670_3743603 | title=Aarons Pens Professional Deal | publisher=Newcastle United | date=1 April 2014 | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Aarons had an impressive pre-season prior to the [[2014–15 Newcastle United F.C. season|2014–15 season]], scoring one goal and creating one assist in the [[2014 Schalke 04 Cup]] against [[Bundesliga]] team [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]].

'''Jack Raymond Colback''' (born 24 October 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

Colback began his career at [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2008, having graduated from [[Sunderland A.F.C. Reserves and Academy|their academy]], and broke into the team following loans at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. After 115 [[Premier League]] appearances with Sunderland, his contract expired and he controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United.   However, as of 11 August 2017, his future with Newcastle United is now in doubt after he was dropped from the 25-strong Premiership squad for the 2017–2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4782786/Newcastle-s-Jack-Colback-set-leave-training-row.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He played once for England at [[England national under-20 football team|Under-20 level]] in 2009, and was called up for the [[England national football team|senior squad]] for the first time in August 2014.

====Early career and loans====
[[File:Jack Colback cropped.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Colback in the match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the final day of the [[2011–12 Premier League]] season.]]
Colback was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Tyne and Wear]]&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; and joined the Sunderland academy at the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Jack Colback"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jack Colback| url = http://www.safc.com/page/ReserveSquadProfiles/0,,10281~1707908,00.html| publisher = Sunderland A.F.C| accessdate = 9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2008, Colback signed his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland tie up academy deals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7428057.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 May 2008|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After manager [[Steve Bruce]] announced his intention to loan out Colback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce loans out starlets|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/5472375/bruce-loans-out-starlets|publisher=Sky Sports|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on [[loan (association football)|loan]] on 6 August 2009 on a deal that would expire in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Ipswich sign Sunderland's Colback"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich sign Sunderland's Colback| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/8187193.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 6 August 2009| accessdate = 19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Ipswich in a 3–3 draw with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] after [[extra time]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], which was won 4–2 in a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name="Shrewsbury   3 - 3   Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = Shrewsbury   3&amp;nbsp;– 3   Ipswich| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8188438.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 13 August 2009| accessdate = 19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[The Football League|Football League]] debut came in a 2–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] after being introduced as a 46th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]].&lt;ref name="West Brom   2 - 0   Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = West Brom   2&amp;nbsp;– 0   Ipswich| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8202374.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 22 August 2009| accessdate = 22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Ipswich against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and scored against them again later on in the season in the [[FA Cup]]. His form meant the loan was extended until the end of the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]] season in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Ipswich Town extend loan for Sunderland's Jack Colback"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich Town extend loan for Sunderland's Jack Colback| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/8448221.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 8 January 2010| accessdate = 9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted Ipswich's Players' Player of the Season 2009–10.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/21042010/63/colback-earns-plaudits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Sunderland from a loan spell at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the end of the 2009–10 Championship season and made his [[Premier League]] debut as a 76th-minute substitute against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He was later sent off for two bookable offences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10281~47536,00.html |title=Match Report: Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 – 1 Sunderland |publisher=Sunderland A.F.C. |accessdate=26 July 2014 |date=9 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512200954/http://www.safc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10281~47536%2C00.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his debut lasting just nine minutes. He made his home debut against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 24 August 2010 as a substitute. Colback went out on loan for a second spell at Ipswich, confirmed on 15 October and which lasted until 6 January when he returned to Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback seals Ipswich return|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/6446517/colback-seals-ipswich-return|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback returns to Black Cats|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11688/6638893/colback-returns-to-black-cats|publisher=Sky Sports|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakthrough====
Following his second loan spell at Ipswich, Colback returned to Sunderland in January 2011, and his appearances became more frequent. Colback started for Sunderland in their [[FA Cup]] 3rd Round defeat to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 8 January. He then came off the bench as Sunderland drew 1–1 against local rivals and the team Colback supported as a child, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], on 16 January. He also appeared as a second-half substitute as Sunderland drew 0–0 with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 5 March. Colback made his first Premier League start for Sunderland in their 2–0 defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback’s keen to prove his class after full debut|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8987692.Colback___s_keen_to_prove_his_class_after_full_debut/|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback also started the following week as Sunderland beat [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 4–1. Colback had arguably his best performance in a Sunderland shirt in their 2–1 win at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] on 7 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/09/bolton-wanderers-sunderland-premier-league | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Jolly | title=Boudewijn Zenden shows his staying power to give Sunderland hope | date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback demonstrated his versatility by being deployed at left back in the final game of the season at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland stroll to a top-ten finish at last|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/football/sunderland/9041857.West_Ham_United_0_Sunderland_3/|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colback started the first game of the 2011–12 season, as Sunderland drew with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield, Liverpool|Anfield]]. Sunderland drew 1–1 with Colback playing alongside [[Lee Cattermole]] in central midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0815/1224302451634.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Andy | last=Hunter | title=Liverpool need a few more like Suarez | date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 2011, Colback scored his first goal for the club, a deflected effort, in 1–1 draw with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/16240466.stm | title=Sunderland   1&amp;nbsp;– 1   Everton | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=BBC Sport | date=26 December 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback was deployed at left back on New Year's Day 2012 against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and helped Sunderland to a surprise victory against the Premier League leaders. He again played at left back in Sunderland's 4–2 win at Wigan two days later, where he sustained a knee injury which ruled him out for a few weeks. On 5 January 2012, he signed a 2-year contract extension which expired in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16433256.stm "Jack Colback signs contract extension"] BBC Sport. 5 January 2012. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Colback returned from injury as a substitute in Sunderland's 1–1 FA Cup draw with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], and returned to the starting line up in central midfield as the Black Cats beat Norwich 3–0 on 1 February. He scored his second goal for Sunderland with a left footed strike in the replay against Middlesbrough at the [[Riverside Stadium]], as Sunderland won 2–1 after extra time to reach the fifth round.

The 2012–13 season saw Colback play regularly at left back due to injuries to [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]], and right back in the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] as Sunderland defeated Newcastle 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Newcastle United 0 Sunderland 3|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22056537|date=14 April 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Colback is willing to play out in position, so it will help the club's solve their issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback happy to play out of position|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/8667214/premier-league-sunderland-midfielder-jack-colback-happy-to-play-out-of-position|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cardiff v Sunderland equaliser.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sunderland players celebrate Colback's last-minute equaliser against Cardiff on 28 December 2013.]]
Following Rose's return to Tottenham, Colback began the 2013–14 season as Sunderland's first choice at left back, before being moved back into central midfield by [[Gus Poyet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Jack Colback happy to be back in Sunderland's midfield|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/8997626/premier-league-jack-colback-happy-to-be-back-in-sunderlands-midfield|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December Colback scored a last minute goal in the fifth minute of injury time to salvage a 2–2 draw at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colback late show rocks Cardiff|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/367315/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback made his 100th Premier League appearance on 1 January 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. He scored his second goal of the season on 1 February 2014, scoring the third goal in a 3–0 away win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newcastle 0–3 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25892175|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his third goal of the season on 7 May 2014, scoring the first goal in a 2–0 home win to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], to retain Sunderland's top division safety and relegating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to the Football League Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland 2 – 0 West Bromwich Albion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26300993|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his contract about to expire at the end of the 2013–14 season, then-manager [[Paolo Di Canio]] urged to Colback to make a decision on his future at Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio calls on Jack Colback to decide over his Sunderland future|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/8849634/paolo-di-canio-calls-on-jack-colback-to-decide-over-his-sunderland-future|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Colback confirmed that talks of a new deal had started after initially rejecting a new contract in the summer under the management of Di Canio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Midfielder Jack Colback in talks over a new contract at Sunderland|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9003798/midfielder-jack-colback-in-talks-over-a-new-contract-at-sunderland|publisher=Sky Sports|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further talks over a new contract continued in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Sunderland discussing new deal with Jack Colback|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9156200/premier-league-sunderland-discussing-new-deal-with-jack-colback|publisher=Sky Sports|date=8 February 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, it was reported that Colback had turned down a new contract with the club and was set to depart upon the expiry of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Jack Colback and Phil Bardsley set to leave Sunderland this summer|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9260526/transfer-news-jack-colback-and-phil-bardsley-set-to-leave-sunderland-this-summer|publisher=Sky Sports|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Premier League clubs made contract offers to sign Colback, but Sunderland refused to give up on Colback and hoped he would stay at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Battle for Sunderland's Jack Colback is hotting up|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9269358/transfer-news-battle-for-sunderlands-jack-colback-is-hotting-up|publisher=Sky Sports|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Sunderland still hoping Jack Colback and Phil Bardsley could yet stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9296561/transfer-news-sunderland-still-hoping-jack-colback-and-phil-bardsley-could-yet-stay|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 May 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2014, Colback signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a free transfer.

In January 2018, Colback joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Colback and Adlene Guedioura make it SEVEN January additions for Nottingham Forest|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/jack-colback-adlene-guedioura-make-1148493|publisher=Nottingham Post|accessdate=9 February 2018|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having joined Forest, he accused Benítez of disrespecting him during his stint at the club and said that he was "treated more like a number than a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newcastle news: Jack Colback lashes out at Rafa Benitez after Nottingham loan move|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/914424/Newcastle-transfer-news-Jack-Colback-Rafa-Benitez-Nottingham-Forest-transfer-news|publisher=Express|accessdate=9 February 2018|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2018, Colback returned to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on a season-long loan with the option to make it permanent at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2018/july/reds-clinch-colback-return/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Colback has received one cap for the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20 team]], he played in a 2–0 friendly win against [[Italy national under-20 football team|Italy]] at Loftus Road in March 2009. He replaced [[Marc Albrighton]] in the 79th minute as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIONS' LOFTUS ROAR|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u20s/News/2009/italy_310309_report|publisher=TheFA.com|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2014, Colback received his first call-up to the [[England national football team|senior team]] for the matches against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy calls up four new faces for Norway and Switzerland|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/aug/norway-switzerland-squad-announcement-rose-colback-delph-chambers|publisher=[[The FA]]|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had to withdraw from the squad with a calf injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colback ruled out for England|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/243/545/0/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Colback out of England squad with calf injury|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29056963|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A former left-back, Colback is a left-footed central midfielder known for his versatility and efficient playing style; due to his technical skills, passing range and physique, he is neat in possession and rarely gives the ball away, which along with his athletic ability and defensive work-rate, allows him to link-up the defence and the attack effectively. Former England manager [[Roy Hodgson]] has likened his abilities to those of [[Andrea Pirlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/28/roy-hodgson-jack-colback-england-newcastle-alan-pardew|title=Roy Hodgson’s ‘Ginger Pirlo’ Jack Colback tipped to make England impact|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Louise Taylor|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/11062428/Mocking-Jack-Colbacks-England-call-up-is-nothing-but-ignorance-and-stupidity-from-armchair-fans.html|title=Mocking Jack Colback's England call-up is nothing but ignorance and stupidity from armchair fans|publisher=The Telegraph|author1=Luke Edwards|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having his spot kick saved, he scored from the rebound with his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36993966 |title=Newcastle United 1–2 Huddersfield Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gayle would score in the next two matches for Newcastle, with a brace in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37030439 |title=Newcastle United 4–1 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only goal of the game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37067397 |title=Bristol City 0–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until over a month later when he found the net again, scoring a hat-trick against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], coming back from 3–1 down to win 4–3 in stoppage time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37426290 |title=Newcastle United 4–3 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During October, Gayle scored braces in consecutive victories against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37593786 |title=Newcastle United 3–1 Brentford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37615018 |title=Barnsley 0–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 20 November, Gayle scored another brace, this time against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37965461 |title=Leeds United 0–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December, Gayle scored a hat-trick against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38193496 |title=Newcastle United 4–0 Birmingham City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later score in matches against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], ending 2016 as the league's top scorer with 19 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38271711 |title=Burton Albion 1–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38412240 |title=Newcastle United 3–1 Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 December 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 win over Brentford, and in doing so, became the first Newcastle player since [[Alan Shearer]] to score 20 league goals in a season. A few minutes later however, he sustained a hamstring injury, and had to be substituted off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38551590 |title=Brentford 1–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injury kept him out for the next four matches; he would make his return against Norwich City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38889065 |title=Norwich City 2–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started the match against Aston Villa, but once again, had to leave the pitch early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38952759 |title=Newcastle United 2–0 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would become a recurring problem for Gayle, and on three occasions from February to April, he had to be substituted off in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39111416 |title=Reading 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39239330 |title=Birmingham 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39464957 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, his goal tally also suffered, as he scored twice during this period, netting against Huddersfield Town and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39086346 |title=Huddersfield Town 1–3 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39389117 |title=Newcastle United 2–1 Wigan Athletic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gayle was absent for the rest of April, and made his return on the final day of the season, scoring in a 3–0 win over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], as Newcastle edged out [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] by a point to win the [[2016–17 EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39760419 |title=Newcastle United 3–0 Barnsley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2017 |accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 4–1 loss to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. His goal was the first that the ''Red Devils'' had conceded from open play since 31 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41951920 |title=Manchester United 4–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 November 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, Gayle again scored the opening goal, this time, in a 3–1 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42119935 |title=Chelsea 4–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December, Gayle was involved in both Newcastle goals in a 3–2 loss to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], assisting [[Joselu]] for the first and then scoring the equaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42205603 |title=Newcastle United 2–3 Leicester City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 December 2017 |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the season, Gayle remained a first team regular, but only scored three more goals for Newcastle – a brace against [[AFC Bournemouth]] in a 2–2 draw on 24 February 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43094246 |title=Bournemouth 2–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a goal against Chelsea in a 3–0 win, the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44020154 |title=Newcastle United 3–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Bromwich Albion (loan)====
On 6 August 2018, Gayle joined newly relegated Championship club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a season-long loan deal from Newcastle. The deal included [[Salomón Rondón]] going the other way for the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2018/august/gayle-arrives-at-the-hawthorns/ |title=Gayle arrives at The Hawthorns |publisher=West Bromwich Albion F.C. |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August, Gayle drew a foul from his former Newcastle teammate [[Tim Krul]], now of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], with the resulting penalty scored by [[Jay Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45066581 |title=Norwich City 3–4 West Bromwich Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 August, Gayle scored his first goal for the club, the fourth goal in a emphatic 7–1 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. He was also the fouled player for both of Rodriguez's penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45152565 |title=West Bromwich Albion 7–1 Queens Park Rangers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During September, Gayle scored four times in three consecutive home match wins over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45304577 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–1 Stoke City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45479782 |title=West Bromwich Albion 4–2 Bristol City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45529540 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–0 Millwall |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September, he scored the third goal, a free-kick, in a 3–2 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45609719 |title=Preston 2–3 West Bromwich Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances, he was awarded with the Championship Player of the Month by the [[English Football League|EFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2018/october/player-of-the-month-dwight-gayle/ |title=Player of the Month: Dwight Gayle |publisher=EFL.com |date=5 October 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October, Gayle scored a brace in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45688429 |title=West Bromwich Albion 4–1 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2019, Gayle was suspended for two matches after accepting a charge of "successful deception of a match official", following an incident in the match against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] earlier that week when he "won" a late penalty enabling his team to take a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dwight Gayle: West Brom striker banned for 'diving' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47245351 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 February 2019 |date=14 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
He is described as an "energetic, hardworking, pacey striker" and a "natural finisher".&lt;ref name=posh/&gt;

==Personal life==
Gayle is of Jamaican descent through his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/dwightgayle/status/286791066059939841 |title=@209fifashirts Jamaica and England |first=Dwight |last=Gayle |date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dwight-gayle-not-focused-international-12231210 |title=Dwight Gayle not focused on international football but reveals he can play for Jamaica |first=Lee |last=Ryder |date=26 November 2016 |newspaper=The Chronicle |location=Newcastle |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
