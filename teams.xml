'''A.F.C. Bournemouth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Bournemouth.ogg|ˈ|b|ɔːr|n|m|ə|θ}}) is a professional [[Association football|football]] club in [[Bournemouth]], [[Dorset]], that play in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. Formed in 1890 as '''Boscombe St. John's Institute F.C.''', the club adopted their current name in 1972. Nicknamed The Cherries, since 1910 Bournemouth have played their home games at [[Dean Court]]. Their home colours are red and black striped shirts, with black shorts and socks.

A.F.C. Bournemouth have won the [[List of teams promoted from the English Football League Championship and predecessors|second]] and [[List of winners of English Football League One and predecessors|third]] tiers of English football, and were twice runners-up of the [[List of winners of English Football League Two and predecessors|fourth tier]]. They have also won the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]], and the [[Football League Third Division South Cup]].

Bournemouth have spent the majority of their history bouncing between the third and fourth tier of English football.  Under manager [[Eddie Howe]], they have risen through the pyramid; the 2015–16 season was A.F.C. Bournemouth's first ever in England's top division.

The club is currently owned by [[Maxim Demin]], a Russian multi-millionaire involved in the petrochemicals trading industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/9827260/who-is-afc-bournemouths-russian-owner-maxim-demin | title=Who is Bournemouth's Russian owner Maxim Demin?|website=www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/9827260/who-is-afc-bournemouths-russian-owner-maxim-demin|access-date=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8171260/eddie-howe-bournemouth-test-of-character-transfer | title=Howe faces test of character as storm clouds gather at cushy Bournemouth | website=www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8171260/eddie-howe-bournemouth-test-of-character-transfer |access-date=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Boscombe F.C.===
Although the exact date of the club's foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John's Institute F.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |title=AFC Bournemouth History |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/ |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2015 |location=Bournemouth |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130115/http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/ |archivedate=26 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C. The first president was Mr. J. C. Nutt.&lt;ref&gt;The official Handbook of Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic Football Club; ''Golden Jubilee 1899–1949''&lt;/ref&gt;

In their first season, 1899–1900, Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons, they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season, the team played on a pitch in [[King's Park, Boscombe|King's Park]]. In the 1905–06 season, Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/|date=24 May 2012|title=AFCB Club History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130115/http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the club was granted a long lease over some wasteland next to Kings Park as the club's football ground by local businessman J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. The same year the club signed its first professional player [[Baven Penton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=The Alphabet of the Saints| publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing | year=1992|page = 270| isbn=0-9514862-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around about this time, the club obtained their nickname "The Cherries," with two foremost tales on how the club gained the nickname. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps less plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which, it is believed may have encompassed numerous cherry orchards.

For the first time, during the 1913–14 season, the club competed in the [[FA Cup]]. The club's progress, however, was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of [[World War I]], and Boscombe F.C. returned to the [[Hampshire League]].

In 1920, the Third Division of the [[Football League]] was formed, and Boscombe were promoted to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], finding moderate success.

[[File:Deancourt 14092013 vblackpool.jpg|400px|thumbnail|right|[[Dean Court]] ]]

===Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic F.C.===
To make the club more representative of the district, the name was changed to Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic F.C. in 1923. During the same year, the club was elected to the newly-expanded [[Football League Third Division (South)|Football League Third Division]]. The first league match was at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on 25 August 1923, which Bournemouth lost 3–1. The first league game at Dean Court was also against Swindon, where Bournemouth gained their first league point after a 0–0 draw.

Initially, Bournemouth struggled in the Football League but eventually established themselves as a Third Division club. Bournemouth remains on the records as the longest continuous members of the Third Division.

As a league club, Bournemouth had to wait until after the Second World War before winning their first trophy. This was accomplished as they beat [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in the Third Division (South) Cup in the final at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].

===A.F.C. Bournemouth===
Under manager [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], the club adopted the more streamlined A.F.C. Bournemouth name in 1972. At the same time, the club adopted a new badge as a symbol of the club's progress. The stripes in the background were based on the club shirt, while in the foreground is the profile of a player heading the ball, in honour of [[Dickie Dowsett]], a prolific scorer for the club in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cherries launch evolved crest |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-15-cherries-launch-evolved-crest-912766.aspx |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |accessdate=10 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925103202/http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-15-cherries-launch-evolved-crest-912766.aspx |archive-date=25 September 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their red and black kit, introduced in 1971, was based on the [[A.C. Milan]] strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roopanarine |first1=Les |title=Harry Redknapp-The Biography |date=2011 |publisher=John Blake Publishing |isbn=9781843589426 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=E0WUkWwx38AC&amp;pg=PT28 |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the era of [[Ted MacDougall]], a prolific goalscorer who, in an FA Cup tie in November 1971, scored nine goals in an 11–0 win against [[Margate F.C.|Margate]].

===Late 20th century===
[[File:AFC Bournemouth League Performance.svg|thumb|right|300px|Chart of yearly table positions of Bournemouth in the League.]]
The club recorded a famous victory over holders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[FA Cup]] in January 1984, while they were managed by [[Harry Redknapp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Struthers |first=Greg |title=Caught in Time: Bournemouth beat Manchester United, FA Cup, 1984 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article786175.ece  |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=17 February 2008 | location=London |newspaper=[[The Times]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |title=8 January 1984: Bournemouth 2 Man Utd 0 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,626795,00.html |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate=17 February 2008 |location=London |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211104810/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,626795,00.html |archive-date=11 December 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redknapp took Bournemouth into the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history as Third Division champions in 1987. After comfortably surviving in their first season in the Second Division, Bournemouth made a serious challenge for promotion to the top flight in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]]; they ultimately fell away after a poor run late in the season, but their eventual finish of 12th place remained their highest-ever in the Football League until the [[2013–14 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2013–14 season]].

On 5 May 1990, the final day of the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] had the chance to win the Second Division and gain promotion into the First Division by beating Bournemouth at Dean Court. Some United fans had already caused trouble in the town during the morning and the atmosphere was tense as Leeds won the match by a single goal. Combined with the results of other matches, this meant that Leeds were promoted while Bournemouth were relegated. The violence and destruction by visitors to Bournemouth continued over the holiday weekend, causing more than £1&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage and injury to opposing fans and police officers.&lt;ref name="archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk/2004/5/5/67408.html |title=Bournemouth, Poole, Christchurch news, sports and jobs. Dorset and Hampshire what's on and leisure&amp;nbsp;– Cherry-o Leeds! |website=Archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk |date=5 May 2004 |accessdate=17 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507170026/http://archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk/2004/5/5/67408.html |archivedate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town's ''[[Bournemouth Daily Echo|Daily Echo]]'' newspaper reported that "spectators, including many young children, had to run to safety as missiles were hurled and riot police waded in to control the crowds."&lt;ref name="archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk"/&gt; The matter was raised in Parliament by one of the town's MPs. Financially, the Leeds trouble affected the club for more than a decade, as Bournemouth were prevented by local police from staging home games on Bank Holidays (traditionally a popular day for football) until a game against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] on 21 April 2003.

Redknapp remained at the club for two more seasons, both of which ended with the club falling three points short of the play-offs. However, mounting financial pressures caused him to resign his position at the end of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]], and he subsequently rejoined former club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] as a coach. He was replaced by [[Tony Pulis]], who built a much cheaper squad that could only manage two consecutive 17th-place finishes before Pulis walked out of the club, blaming financial pressures.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Bournemouth went the first few months of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] without a permanent manager in place, and a dreadful start saw them bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season. Despite a minor upturn in form when [[Mel Machin]] was appointed as manager, they looked highly unlikely to survive, given that there were five relegation spots in Division Two for that season due to league reconstruction. However, a late run of form combined with collapses by relegation rivals [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] saw them survive on the last day of the season by two points.

Machin ultimately remained in charge for six years, most of which were marked by unremarkable mid-table finishes. The [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]] proved to be arguably the highlight of his tenure, with the club making a serious playoff challenge for most of the season, but ultimately falling short and finishing seventh. However, a drop to 16th place in the [[1999–2000 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|1999–2000 season]] followed by a poor start to the following season saw Machin removed from his position and given the role of director of football.

===Early 21st century===
[[Image:AFC Bournemouth.svg|200px|thumb|right|Former AFC Bournemouth crest]]
[[Sean O'Driscoll]] was promoted from the coaching staff in place of Mel Machin at the start of the [[2000–01 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2000–01 season]]. In O'Driscoll's first season as manager, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the Division Two playoffs but were relegated a year later in the new stadium (in the early part of the 2001–02 season, they played their home matches at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]]'s ground while their own stadium was being redeveloped). The board kept faith in O'Driscoll and they were rewarded with promotion via the Division Three playoffs in [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]]. The club became the first to score five goals at the [[Millennium Stadium]] when they beat [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] 5-2 in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] Division Three play-off final with goals from [[Steve Fletcher]], [[Carl Fletcher (Welsh footballer)|Carl Fletcher]] (2), [[Stephen Purches]] and [[Garreth O'Connor]]. Under O'Driscoll, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the play-offs for the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] and [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] seasons, and just avoided relegation in the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season.

Long-serving player [[James Hayter (footballer)|James Hayter]] scored the fastest league hat-trick in English Football League history during the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season. The Cherries were leading 3–0 against [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] thanks to goals from Stephen Purches, [[Warren Cummings]] and [[Warren Feeney]] when Hayter was brought onto the field as a substitute. With 86 minutes gone, Hayter managed to net three goals in the space of two minutes and 17 seconds, making the final score 6–0 to Bournemouth.

In September 2006, with the team in eighth in the League, Sean O'Driscoll left to become manager of [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. He was replaced by [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]].

===Decline and administration (2008–2009)===
In February 2008, Bournemouth were forced into administration, suffering a ten-point deduction which put them in relegation trouble. Bournemouth had debts of around £4&amp;nbsp;million and almost went out of business completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7233678.stm |title=Cherries go into administration |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210215154/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7233678.stm |archive-date=10 February 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The off-field uncertainty continued throughout the season, with only one, ultimately unsuccessful, bid for the club accepted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://world.afcb.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10324~1280796,00.html |title=3 April Press conference transcript |website=Afcb.premiumtv.co.uk |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404134434/http://world.afcb.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10324~1280796,00.html |archive-date=4 April 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the club ended the season being relegated to [[League Two]].

Ahead of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], the team's future in the Football League was put into doubt when the league threatened to block Bournemouth's participation in League Two, due to problems with the team's continuing administration and change in ownership. It ordered both Bournemouth and [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] to demonstrate that they could fulfil all of their fixtures and find a way out of administration,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/06/rotherham.bournemouth Troubled League Two clubs on the brink] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305003433/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/06/rotherham.bournemouth |date=5 March 2017 }} ''The Guardian'', 6 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; eventually allowing the club to compete with a 17-point penalty for failing to follow the Football League insolvency rules.

Early into the season, manager Bond was sacked and was replaced by former player [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Irish footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]], who would himself leave the club only a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013110.QUINN_AND_CHERRIES_PART_COMPANY Quinn and Cherries Part Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304065322/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013110.QUINN_AND_CHERRIES_PART_COMPANY/ |date=4 March 2012 }} ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'', 31 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Former player [[Eddie Howe]] took over as manager with the club still ten points adrift at the bottom of the league and initially on a caretaker basis, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11750_4817560,00.html |title=Howe handed permanent role |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2009 |publisher=Sky Sports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602062338/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11750_4817560,00.html |archive-date=2 June 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, it was announced that local businessman Adam Murry had completed the purchase of 50% of the club's shares from previous chairman, Paul Baker. However, in January 2009, Murry missed the deadline to buy Baker's shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013023.UPDATED__CLUB_CONFIRMS_BAKER_BUY_OUT Club Confirms Baker Buy-Out] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304065441/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013023.UPDATED__CLUB_CONFIRMS_BAKER_BUY_OUT/ |date=4 March 2012 }} ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'', 31 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final home game of the 2008–09 season, the Cherries guaranteed their Football League status by beating [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 2–1 with a winning goal ten minutes from time by Bournemouth's Steve Fletcher, sparking wild celebrations after a fairytale ending to "The Great Escape." They finished their troubled season with their best away win in 30 years with a 4–0 victory at [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]].

In June 2009, a consortium including Adam Murry finally took over A.F.C. Bournemouth. The consortium included Jeff Mostyn, former vice-chairman Steve Sly, Neill Blake and former [[Dorchester Town]] chairman Eddie Mitchell.

===Rise to the Premier League (2009–2015)===

Howe's first full season in charge brought success as Bournemouth finished second in League Two to earn promotion with two games to spare. Howe subsequently left the club for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] during the following season; his successor, another former Bournemouth player, [[Lee Bradbury]], led Bournemouth to the League One play-offs. The two-legged semi-final against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] finished 3–3 after extra time, and Huddersfield went through the final by winning the penalty shoot-out 4–2. Bradbury was unable to lead Bournemouth to another promotion challenge in the [[2011–12 Football League One]], placing 11th after a season of indifferent results, and was replaced by youth team coach [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]] for the final games of the season.

Groves remained in charge at the start of the [[2012–13 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2012–13 season]], only to be sacked in October 2012 following a start which left the club near the bottom of the table. Eddie Howe returned as manager, and not only did he pull the club away from their early-season relegation battle, they achieved promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], returning to the second-tier of English football for the first time since 1990. The club also revealed a new club crest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football-shirts.co.uk/fans/afc-bournemouth-launch-new-crest_21507.AFC Bournemouth Launch New Crest] ''Football-shirts.co.uk'', 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After a promising start to life in the Championship, the club was handed a fourth Round [[FA Cup]] tie with [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] which ended in a 2–0 loss. Bournemouth finished their first season back in the Championship in tenth place, their highest ever position in the Football League.

On 25 October 2014, Bournemouth won 8–0 away at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game and their largest winning margin in the league (barring a 10–0 win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in September 1939, which was discounted after the league was abandoned due to the Second World War).&lt;ref name="bbc 2014-10-25"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| author2 =| year =2014| url =https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29669693| title =Managerless Birmingham City suffered a humiliating defeat as Bournemouth scored eight goals at St Andrew's| format =| work =| publisher =BBC| accessdate =25 October 2014| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141026213420/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29669693| archive-date =26 October 2014| dead-url =no| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club followed up this success with a 2–1 victory over [[Premier League]] side [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the League Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time. Bournemouth were again drawn against Liverpool but lost 3–1. The club spent most of the [[2014–15 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2014–15 season]] near the top of the table, and a 3-0 win away at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on the final day of the season was enough to clinch the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the top flight of English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery: All the incredible pictures as Cherries are crowned champions of Football League|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12928783.GALLERY__All_the_incredible_pictures_as_Cherries_are_crowned_champions_of_Football_League/|work=Bournemouth Echo|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505021053/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12928783.GALLERY__All_the_incredible_pictures_as_Cherries_are_crowned_champions_of_Football_League/|archive-date=5 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premier League era (2015–present)===
Bournemouth's first ever game in the top flight of English football was a 1–0 defeat home to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] played on 8 August 2015. Early on in the 2015–16 season the team was beset by a number of crippling injuries, including to their captain, [[Tommy Elphick]] and their star striker from the previous season, [[Callum Wilson (English footballer)|Callum Wilson]], the latter of which was injured for the majority of the season. The team struggled for most of the first half of the season until a turning point was reached during a game at Dean Court against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in which [[Junior Stanislas]] scored a goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time to tie the game. From there, Bournemouth defeated [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in back-to-back wins. The team eventually finished 16th in the league, securing their Premier League status for another year. 

Their second season, despite being largely tipped to suffer [[second season syndrome]], they defied all odds to finish in 9th place. Their squad was largely defined by the highly publicized loans of [[Jack Wilshere]] from Arsenal and [[Nathan Aké]] from Chelsea, but also by the strong form of [[Joshua King (footballer)|Josh King]], who scored 16 goals in 36 appearances, and the £15 million pound move of [[Jordon Ibe]] from [[Liverpool]]. A weak start to the season saw them in the relegation zone for the first three weeks, but after a 1–0 victory against [[West Bromwich Albion]], they never again dropped below 16th place in the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37263912 | work=BBC News | title=Wilson gets winner as Bournemouth beat West Brom | date=10 September 2016 | access-date=21 May 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522121237/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37263912 | archive-date=22 May 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key points of the season occurred when they soundly defeated [[Hull City]] 6–1 and defeated Liverpool 4–3, both of which helped their survival push at the end of the season, when they went unbeaten in the last five matches and earned 11 points from 15.

In preparation for the following season, Howe signed Aké permanently for a club-record fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2719012-nathan-ake-officially-completes-bournemouth-transfer-from-chelsea-for-record-fee|title=Nathan Ake Officially Completes Bournemouth Transfer from Chelsea for Record Fee|first=Christopher|last=Simpson|website=Bleacherreport.com|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230829/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2719012-nathan-ake-officially-completes-bournemouth-transfer-from-chelsea-for-record-fee|archive-date=27 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Asmir Begović]] and [[Jermain Defoe]] also signed deals at Dean Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/3683466/bournemouth-confirm-10m-signing-of-chelsea-goalkeeper-asmir-begovic-on-long-term-deal/|title=Bournemouth confirm £10m signing of Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic on long-term deal|date=30 May 2017|website=Thesun.co.uk|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628015540/https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/3683466/bournemouth-confirm-10m-signing-of-chelsea-goalkeeper-asmir-begovic-on-long-term-deal/|archive-date=28 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season began poorly, with the team losing their first 4 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41133353|title=Arsenal 3–0 Bournemouth|website=Bbc.com|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717184559/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41133353|archive-date=17 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a run of good form through late December and January saw them steer clear the relegation zone, and saw Howe earn his second Premier League Manager of the Month award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/356463|title=Howe wins January Barclays Manager of the Month|website=Premierleague.com|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230710/https://www.premierleague.com/news/356463|archive-date=27 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They won 2–1 at home against [[Arsenal F.C|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42594402|title=Bournemouth 2–1 Arsenal|date=14 January 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713031052/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42594402|archive-date=13 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a 3–0 victory at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] against Chelsea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42799048|title=Chelsea 0–3 Bournemouth|date=31 January 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713024040/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42799048|archive-date=13 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained 19 points from losing positions in the second half of the season; a Premier League Record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/afcbournemouth/status/1031228761411342336|title=AFC Bournemouth 🍒 on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team battled inconsistent form the rest of the season, but still managed a 12th place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&amp;se=79&amp;ha=-1|title=Premier League Table, Form Guide &amp; Season Archives|website=www.premierleague.com|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230801/https://www.premierleague.com/tables?co=1&amp;se=79&amp;ha=-1|archive-date=27 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Fair Play violation during promotion season==

In 2016, Bournemouth was found guilty of violating the Football League’s Financial Fair Play regulations during 2014–2015, the season it secured promotion to the Premier League. 

The club’s over-spend broke the ‘maximum deviation’, with a £38.3 million financial loss in 2014–2015. This followed a loss of £10.3 million in 2013–2014. 

===Financial punishment===
Bournemouth was originally fined £7.6 million by the Football League, but subsequently negotiated a settlement with a fine of £4.75 million for breaching Financial Fair Play rules. The decision followed months of speculation and investigation about the club breaking Football League regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/10267899/bournemouth-fined-7-6m-after-breaching-financial-fair-play-rules|title=Bournemouth fined £7.6m after breaching Financial Fair Play rules|website=www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/10267899/bournemouth-fined-7-6m-after-breaching-financial-fair-play-rules|access-date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://talksport.com/football/395272/afc-bournemouth-fine-financial-fair-play/|title=CHERRIES CHARGED AFC Bournemouth agree to pay £4.75million fine for breaching Financial Fair Play rules|website=talksport.com/football/395272/afc-bournemouth-fine-financial-fair-play|access-date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bournemouth-face-hefty-fine-football-7066844

==Colours and crest==
The team's colours have varied slightly throughout the club's history.

'''Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən|...|ˈ|h|oʊ|v}} is a professional [[association football|football]] club from [[Brighton]] based in [[Falmer]], East Sussex, England. They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. Brighton's home ground is the 30,750-capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/26683559 |title=Brighton ground at capacity - Barber |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falmer Stadium]].

Founded in 1901, and nicknamed the "Seagulls" or "[[Albion]]", Brighton played their early professional football in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], before being elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.

By the late 1990s, Brighton had slipped to the fourth tier of English football and were in financial trouble. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016–17 EFL Championship|2016–17 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.

==History==
{{recentism|date=May 2018}}
{{main|History of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.}}
[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] – having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton &amp; Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in bottom place.

Despite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2–2 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. This was the final that featured the "miss" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well known phrase "...and Smith must score".  However, Smith's kick was actually saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4–0.

After four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.

By the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] – the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.

The sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999–2000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000–01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions – winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].

During May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who had successfully secured £93&amp;nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and secured 75% shareholding at the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009. Retrieved 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton's final season at [[Withdean Stadium|Withdean]] was 2010–11, in which they won League One. The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.

The [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2–1 to Albion. The 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On the final day of the 2013–14 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2–1 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, García resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypiä]] was appointed manager for the 2014–15 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3–0 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1–1 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.

Brighton started 2016–17 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2–1 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2–1 Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the current club record signing of [[José Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over £13&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season and never really being threatened with relegation, despite going on a run of 1 win in 12 games and falling to within a point of the drop zone. However they were able to recover, beating the likes of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to finish the season in 15th, seven points above the relegation zone.

==Stadium==
===Goldstone Ground===
[[File:Goldstone Ground - geograph-1220106.jpg|thumb|[[Goldstone Ground]] (1902–1997)]]
For 95 years Brighton and Hove Albion were based at the [[Goldstone Ground]] in [[Hove]], until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by majority shareholder [[Bill Archer (businessman)|Bill Archer]] and his chief executive [[David Bellotti]], proved controversial, and the move provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received little if any money from this sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html |title=Club in Crisis Brighton |publisher=Club in Crisis |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926121254/http://www.clubsincrisis.com/brighton/brighton_crisis_history.html |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their last season at the Goldstone, [[1996-97 Football League|1996–97]], the Seagulls were in danger of relegation from the [[The Football League|Football League]]. They won their final game at the Goldstone against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10329~2360994,00.html |title=WELCOME – BRIGHTON &amp; HOVE ALBION |publisher=Doncaster Rovers F.C. |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519122819/http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10329~2360994%2C00.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up a winner-takes-all relegation game at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], who were level on points with the Seagulls. Brighton drew 1–1, and Hereford were relegated to the [[Football Conference]] on goals scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4SyMPHlwn8|title=WE ARE STAYING UP|via=YouTube|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdean Stadium===
For two years, from 1997 to 1999, the club shared [[Priestfield Stadium]], the ground of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], before returning to Brighton to play at [[Withdean Stadium]]. This is not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a [[zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpmcollections.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/withdean-stadium/|title=Withdean Stadium|publisher=Royal Pavilion &amp; Brighton Museums|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the cost of the public enquiry into planning permission for a new stadium, rent on [[Withdean Stadium]], fees paid to use [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham's]] [[Priestfield Stadium]], and a general running deficit due to the low ticket sales inherent with a small ground, the club had an accumulated deficit of £9.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2004. The board of directors paid £7&amp;nbsp;million of this; the other £2.5&amp;nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falmer Stadium===
[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]

On 28 October 2005 the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton &amp; Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.

Building of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 12 years without a home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite.&lt;ref name=expansionjan12&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9446804.Albion_s___36_million_plans_to_push_for_Premiership/ |title=Albion's £36&amp;nbsp;million plans to push for Premiership |accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Argus|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was granted unanimously by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012.

'''Liverpool Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club in [[Liverpool]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club [[List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won|has won]] 5 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|more]] than any other English club, 3 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups]], 3 [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, 18 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], 7 [[FA Cup]]s, a record 8 [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], and 15 [[FA Community Shield]]s.

Founded in 1892, the club joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] the following year and has played at [[Anfield]] since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when [[Bill Shankly]] and [[Bob Paisley]] led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of [[Rafael Benítez]] and captained by [[Steven Gerrard]], Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]].

Liverpool was the [[Deloitte Football Money League|ninth highest-earning]] football club in the world in 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €424.2&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html|title=Deloitte Football Money League 2018|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|eighth most valuable]] football club in 2018, valued at $1.944&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/06/12/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2018/#3dddb7c845c8|title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2018|last=Ozanian|first=Mike|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is one of the best supported teams in the world.&lt;ref name=“global”&gt;{{cite news |title=How Liverpool's worldwide fanbase will be tuning into events at Manchester United |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/how-liverpools-worldwide-fanbase-tuning-14387039 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. 

The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the [[1985 European Cup Final]] in Brussels, with 39 people – mostly Italians and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition, and the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a [[Human stampede|crush]] against perimeter fencing.

The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]".

[[File:John Houlding.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Houlding]], the founder of Liverpool F.C.|alt=Black and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.]]

Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] committee and [[John Houlding]], club president and owner of the land at [[Anfield]]. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to [[Goodison Park]] in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.&lt;ref name="formed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=11 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712112221/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |archivedate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after [[The Football Association]] refused to recognise the club as Everton.{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=14}} The team won the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in its début season, and joined the [[Football League Second Division]] at the start of the 1893–94 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], which it won in 1901 and again in 1906.{{sfn|Graham|1985|pp=16–18}}

Liverpool reached its first [[FA Cup Final]] in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], losing 1–0 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-[[West Ham Utd]] centre half [[George Kay]].{{sfn|Graham|1985|p=20}} Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=14}} The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|pp=50–51}} Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] in the 1958–59 FA Cup, [[Bill Shankly]] was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24&amp;nbsp;players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other "[[The Boot Room|Boot Room]]" members [[Joe Fagan]], [[Reuben Bennett]], and [[Bob Paisley]] began reshaping the team.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=57}}

The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1965/intro.html |title=1965/66: Stan the man for Dortmund |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510160346/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season%3D1965/intro.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool won both the League and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.{{sfn|Kelly|1999|p=86}} In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.{{sfn|Pead|1986|p=414}} During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive [[Football League Cup|League Cups]]; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=157}}

Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=158}} Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.{{sfn|Cox|Russell|Vamplew|2002|p=90}} Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] at the [[King Baudouin Stadium|Heysel Stadium]]. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_2733000/2733979.stm |title=On This Day&amp;nbsp;– 29 May 1985: Fans die in Heysel rioting |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=29 May 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and [[Kenny Dalglish]] was appointed as [[player-manager]].{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=172}} During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup "[[Double (association football)|Double]]" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the [[Hillsborough disaster]]: in an FA Cup semi-final against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm |title=On This Day&amp;nbsp;– 15 April 1989: Soccer fans crushed at Hillsborough |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=15 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hillsborough-victim-died-accidentally-coroner-says-withdrawal-of-treatment-not-to-blame-1469037.html |title=Hillsborough victim died 'accidentally': Coroner says withdrawal of treatment not to blame |work=The Independent |date=22 December 1993 |accessdate=28 August 2010 |first=Malcolm |last=Pithers}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting [[Taylor Report]] paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/318497.stm |title=A hard lesson to learn |publisher=BBC |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last minute of the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/29/arsenal-liverpool-1989-football |title=The night Football was reborn |work=The Observer |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |first=Jason |last=Cowley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player [[Graeme Souness]].{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|pp=104–105}} Under his leadership Liverpool won the [[1992 FA Cup Final]], but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by [[Roy Evans]], and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so [[Gérard Houllier]] was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |title=The Boot Room Boys: Inside the Anfield Boot Room |page=227 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a "[[Treble (association football)|Treble]]": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335026.stm |title=Houllier acclaims Euro triumph |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1600193.stm |title=Houllier 'satisfactory' after surgery |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 October 2001 |accessdate=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.

Houllier was replaced by [[Rafael Benítez]] at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]], beating [[A.C. Milan]] 3–2 in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] after the match ended with a score of 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AC Milan 3–3 Liverpool (aet)|publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4573159.stm|accessdate=15 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4756045.stm |title=Liverpool 3–3 West Ham (aet) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2006 |accessdate=26 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American businessmen [[George N.

In the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League.

==Colours and badge==
[[File:Liverpool FC 1892-1896 kit.jpg|thumb|upright|Liverpool's home colours worn from 1892 to 1896&lt;ref name="colours"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/historical-lfc-kits |title=Historical LFC Kits |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=12 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724034342/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/historical-lfc-kits |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A blue and white shirt and white shorts]]

For much of Liverpool's history its home colours have been all red, but when the club was founded its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The blue and white quartered shirts were used until 1894, when the club adopted the city's colour of red.&lt;ref name="formed" /&gt; The city's symbol of the [[liver bird]] was adopted as the club's badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964, when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all red strip.&lt;ref name=colours /&gt; Liverpool played in all red for the first time against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], as [[Ian St. John]] recalled in his autobiography:

:{{quote|He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. "Get into those shorts and let's see how you look", he said. "Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall." "Why not go the whole hog, boss?" I suggested. "Why not wear red socks? Let's go out all in red." Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-1817155,00.html |title=Shankly: the hero who let me down|work=The Times|accessdate=12 September 2006 |date=9 October 2005 |first=Ian |last=St. John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season, when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and [[ecru]], the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012–15, the kits were designed by [[Warrior Sports]], who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lfc-and-warrior-announcement |title=LFC and Warrior announcement |accessdate=18 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120015751/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lfc-and-warrior-announcement |archivedate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Warrior's parent company [[New Balance]] announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Balance Challenges Nike And Adidas With Entry into Global Soccer Market |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/02/04/new-balance-enters-global-soccer-market/ |first=Kurt |last=Badenhausen |work=Forbes |date=4 February 2015|accessdate=4 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by [[Umbro]] until 1985, when they were replaced by [[Adidas]], who produced the kits until 1996 when [[Reebok]] took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.{{sfn|Crilly|2007|p=28}}

Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jul/06/theknowledge.sport |first1=James |last1=Dart |first2=Mark |last2=Tinklin |title=Has a streaker ever scored? |work=The Guardian |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the club has been sponsored by [[Crown Paints]], [[Candy (company)|Candy]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Standard Chartered]]. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/05/carlsberg-liverpool-sponsorship-markets-equities-beer.html |title=Carlsberg and Liverpool might part ways |work=Forbes |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |first=Javier |last=Espinoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool and Standard Chartered announce sponsorship deal |url=http://www.standardchartered.com/media-centre/press-releases/2009/documents/20090914/index.html |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=Standard Chartered Bank |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the [[Shankly Gates]]. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an [[eternal flame]] burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/hillsborough |title=Hillsborough |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool kit launch sparks anger among Hillsborough families|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18033752|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panorama of Anfield with new main stand (29676137824).jpg|thumb|alt=The interior of a stadium.|[[Anfield]], home of Liverpool F.C.]]

Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=112}} Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=187}}

The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.&lt;ref name="Pocket"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The pocket book of Liverpool|last=Moynihan|first=Leo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]] after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=113}} The hill was the site of the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in the [[Second Boer War]], where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=188}} At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0100news/tm_objectid=17610578&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061&amp;headline=how-kop-tuned-in-to-glory-days-name_page.html#story_continue |first=James |last=Pearce |title=How Kop tuned into glory days |work=Liverpool Echo |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210193006/http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/0100news/tm_objectid%3D17610578%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50061%26headline%3Dhow-kop-tuned-in-to-glory-days-name_page.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak, and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276.&lt;ref name="prem"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4f/53/0,,12306~152399,00.pdf |title=Premier League Handbook Season 2010/11 |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=Premier League |page=35 |chapter=Club Directory |accessdate=17 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214090029/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4f/53/0%2C%2C12306~152399%2C00.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the ''Taylor Report'' precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/stadium/anfield |title=Anfield |publisher=Liverpool F.C |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed [[Stanley Park Stadium]] in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1992484.stm |title=Liverpool unveil new stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2002 |accessdate=17 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning permission was granted in July 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0500liverpoolfc/gronudmove/tm_objectid=14487239%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=reds%2dstadium%2dgets%2dgo%2dahead-name_page.html |first=Mike |last=Hornby |title=Reds stadium gets go-ahead |work=Liverpool Echo |date=31 July 2004 |accessdate=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a [[999-year lease]] on the proposed site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/5327426.stm |title=Liverpool get go-ahead on stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with [[HKS, Inc.]] contracted to build the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7081610.stm|title=Liverpool's stadium move granted |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300&amp;nbsp;million needed for the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8261975.stm |title=Liverpool stadium 'will be built' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ben|title=Liverpool to redevelop Anfield instead of building on Stanley Park|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19935925|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100&amp;nbsp;million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260&amp;nbsp;million project to improve the Anfield area. Jurgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as "impressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-37319956|title=Liverpool's new Main Stand boosts Anfield capacity to 54,000|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ''Carousel'' and later recorded by Liverpool musicians [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]], is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Simon|title=Anfield’s 50 years of never walking alone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/anfields-50-years-of-never-walking-alone-8905022.html|publisher=''The Independent''|accessdate=20 July 2018|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1896769/index.html |title=Liverpool |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) |accessdate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly.

The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. [[UEFA]] laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1496054,00.html |first=David |last=McKie |title=Thatcher set to demand FA ban on games in Europe |work=The Guardian |date=31 May 1985 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/768380.stm |title=The Heysel disaster |publisher=BBC |date=29 May 2000 |accessdate=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/9/newsid_2503000/2503885.stm |title=1987: Liverpool fans to stand trial in Belgium |publisher=BBC |date=9 September 1987 |accessdate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14&amp;nbsp;Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;&lt;ref name="witnesses"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Jackson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/03/newsstory.sport |title=The witnesses |work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 May 2006 |date=4 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; half of the terms were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/768142.stm |title=Liverpool remembers Heysel|publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 May 2006 |date=29 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper published an article entitled "The Truth", in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/11/pressandpublishing.football |first=David |last=Smith |title=The city that eclipsed the Sun |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' more than 20&amp;nbsp;years later.&lt;ref name="boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/an-own-goal-rooney-caught-in-crossfire-between-the-sun-and-an-unforgiving-city-552460.html|title=An own goal?

Liverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the [[Merseyside derby]].

As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. [[John McKenna]] took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=108}} McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=109}} The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.{{sfn|Liversedge|1991|p=110}} His successor was [[Noel White]] who became chairman in 1990.{{sfn|Reade|2009|p=206}} In August 1991 [[David Moores]], whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became chairman. His uncle [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973.

Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9&amp;nbsp;million.

==Liverpool in popular culture==
Because of its successful history, Liverpool is often featured when football is depicted in British culture and has appeared in a number of media firsts. The club appeared in the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]'', which screened highlights of its match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.{{sfn|Kelly|1988|p=192}} Liverpool fans featured in the [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Fearless (Pink Floyd song)|Fearless]]", in which they sang excerpts from "You'll Never Walk Alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A330652 |title=The Hillsborough Tragedy |publisher=BBC |date=16 June 2000 |accessdate=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released a song known as the "[[Anfield Rap]]", featuring [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] and other members of the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4770012.stm |title=Footballer Barnes for rap return |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary drama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by [[Jimmy McGovern]], was screened in 1996. It featured [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Trevor Hicks, whose story is the focus of the script. Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/04/99/hillsborough/313635.stm |title=Hillsborough's Sad Legacy |publisher=BBC |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool featured in the film ''[[The 51st State]]'' (also known as ''Formula 51''), in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza ([[Robert Carlyle]]) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180304 |title=Formula 51 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=18 October 2002 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |first=Roger |last=Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was featured in a children's television show called ''[[Scully (TV series)|Scully]]''; the plot revolved around a young boy, Francis Scully, who tried to gain a trial match with Liverpool.

'''Manchester City Football Club''' is a [[association football|football]] club based in [[Manchester]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as '''St. Mark's (West Gorton)''', it became '''Ardwick Association Football Club''' in 1887 and '''Manchester City''' in 1894. The club's home ground is the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at [[Maine Road]] since 1923.

Manchester City entered the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1899, and won their first major honour with the [[FA Cup]] in [[1904 FA Cup Final|1904]]. It had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Malcolm Allison]]. After losing the [[1981 FA Cup Final]], the club went through a period of decline, culminating in [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the third tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, Manchester City was purchased in 2008 by [[Abu Dhabi United Group]] for £210&amp;nbsp;million and received considerable financial investment. 

The club won the Premier League in [[2011–12 Premier League|2012]], [[2013–14 Premier League|2014]] and, most recently in [[2017–18 Premier League|2018]], also becoming the first Premier League team to [[Premier_League_records_and_statistics#Points|attain 100 points]] in a single season. Manchester City's revenue was the [[Deloitte Football Money League|fifth highest]] of a football club in the world in the 2017–18 season at €527.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html|title=Deloitte Football Money League 2018|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-20-most-popular-rich-list-football-teams-on-social-media-2018-8/#10-manchester-city-493-million-followers-11 UK Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|fifth most valuable]] in the world at $2.47&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/06/12/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2018/#3dddb7c845c8|title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2018|last=Ozanian|first=Mike|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 1–0 at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] to win the [[FA Cup]]; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup [[Double (association football)|double]] that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p32&lt;/ref&gt;
In the seasons following the [[FA Cup]] triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain [[Billy Meredith]], who subsequently moved across town to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester:The Greatest City'', pp 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at [[Maine Road]] in [[Moss Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Maine Road through the ages |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/3011895.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2003 |accessdate=10 September 2011 |first=Chris |last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke the record for the [[Record home attendances of English football clubs|highest home attendance of any club in English football history]], as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1934 – a record which still stands to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup special: Thrills, spills and a cast of thousands at Maine Road |last=James |first=Gary |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1418817_fa-cup-special-thrills-spills-and-a-cast-of-thousands-at-maine-road?order=liked#comments |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175959/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1418817_fa-cup-special-thrills-spills-and-a-cast-of-thousands-at-maine-road?order=liked |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=England 1937/38| work=league table from RSSSF | url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1937-38.html| accessdate=29 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the [[Revie Plan]] reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and won the second. The [[1956 FA Cup Final|1956 final]], in which Manchester City beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 3–1, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper [[Bert Trautmann]] continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann – The Biography'', pp. 178–184&lt;/ref&gt;

After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in January 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1965, the management team of [[Joe Mercer]] and [[Malcolm Allison]] was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in [[Mike Summerbee]] and [[Colin Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Penney, ''Manchester City – The Mercer-Allison Years'', pp. 27–36&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later, in [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68]], Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 win at Newcastle United and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, ''Manchester City – The Mercer-Allison Years'', pp. 37–56&lt;/ref&gt; Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in [[1969 FA Cup Final|1969]], before achieving European success by winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1970, beating [[Górnik Zabrze]] 2–1 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, ''The Manchester City Football Book No. 2'', pp. 13–22&lt;/ref&gt; City also won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] that season, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.

The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', pp. 410–420&lt;/ref&gt; One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player [[Denis Law]] scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Other results meant United would have been relegated even if they had won or drawn, but neither team knew this at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''The Manchester City Story'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.

[[File:ManchesterCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|300px|Chart of yearly table positions of City in the Football League.]]
A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on unsuccessful signings, such as [[Steve Daley]].&lt;ref&gt;Tossell, ''Big Mal'', Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of [[Peter Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City – The Complete Record'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the [[Premier League]] upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three seasons of struggle before being relegated in 1996.  After two seasons in Division One, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third league tier, after [[1. FC Magdeburg]] of Germany.

After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] introducing greater fiscal discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Andy |author2=Burgess, Richard |title=Blue Moon Rising: The Fall and Rise of Manchester City |publisher=Milo |location=Bury |year=2000 |isbn=0-9530847-4-4}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Under manager [[Joe Royle]], City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. [[Kevin Keegan]] replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]] Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester City – The Complete Record, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]] was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a [[Manchester derby|derby]] win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/1109/manchester.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219015810/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/1109/manchester.htm |archivedate=19 December 2007 |title= Goater double gives City derby win | accessdate=28 May 2007 |work=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt; City also qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years. In the 2003 close season, the club moved to the new [[City of Manchester Stadium]]. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] became the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6241052.stm|title=Eriksson named Man City manager|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=Eriksson's reign at Man City ends|publisher=BBC Sport|date = 2 June 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7430827.stm|accessdate =2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksson was replaced by [[Mark Hughes]] two days later on 4 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By 2008, the club was in a financially precarious position.

The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] [[Robinho]] from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for £32.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Robinho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7593026.stm|title=Man City beat Chelsea to Robinho|publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2008|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There wasn't a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100&amp;nbsp;million on players [[Gareth Barry]], [[Roque Santa Cruz]], [[Kolo Touré]], [[Emmanuel Adebayor]], [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Joleon Lescott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8216645.stm|title=Lescott completes Man City move |date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by [[Roberto Mancini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8422676.stm|title= Mark Hughes sacked as Man City appoint Mancini manager|accessdate=19 December 2009|date=19 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League, and competed in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in season [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]].

Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the [[2011 FA Cup Final]], their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 1 – 0 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9457489.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the [[1976 Football League Cup Final|1976 League Cup]]. In the same week, the club qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time since 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 1 – 0 Tottenham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9480251.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.
[[File:Centre d'entraînement Manchester City 20-02-15.jpg|thumb|380px|left|Manchester City moved into their new complex at the [[Etihad Campus]] adjacent to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2014.]]
Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at [[White Hart Lane]] and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Man City's title win really the best Premier League moment ever?

The following season City failed to capitalise on the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated [[Wigan Athletic A.F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=REVEALED: Bitter dressing room battles that sealed the fate of preening Mancini |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2326322/Roberto-Mancini-revealed-The-Manchester-City-dressing-room-battles-sacking.html |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini: Manchester City sack manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22507128 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[BBC Sports Editor]] David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini: Man City exit because of poor relationships |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22523981 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his place was appointed the Chilean [[Manuel Pellegrini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manuel Pellegrini: Manchester City appoint Chilean as manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22909811 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pellegrini's first season, City [[2014 Football League Cup Final|won the League Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Pete|title=Capital One Cup final: Manchester City win Capital One Cup after beating Sunderland 3–1|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/307826/report|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=[[Sky Sports News]]|date=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regained the Premier League title on the last day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City crowned Premier League champions with 2–0 victory over West Ham|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/287660/report|accessdate=11 May 2014|work=[[Sky Sports]]|date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester City won the [[2017–18 Premier League]] title. The club had the highest point total in Premier League history and broke numerous Club and English league records in that season. That season, they also won the [[2017-18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]], and won it the season [[2018-19 EFL Cup|after]], which was the first time in Manchester City history that the club retained a major trophy.

== Club badge and colours ==
[[File:A6-EYE (14077630048).jpg|thumb|240px|right|Manchester City's [[City of Manchester stadium|stadium]] and shirt have been sponsored by [[Etihad Airways]] since 2009.]]
Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several different colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled ''Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City'' published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager [[Malcolm Allison]], who believed that adopting the colours of [[A.C. Milan]] would inspire City to glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Nicking the shirts off their backs| work=The Guardian| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1643916,00.html| accessdate=18 December 2006 | location=London | first=Georgina | last=Turner | date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allison's theory worked, with City winning the [[1969 FA Cup Final]], [[1970 League Cup Final]] and the [[1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.

City have previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the [[City of Manchester]] are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club.&lt;ref&gt;David Clayton, ''Everything Under the Blue Moon'' (Mainstream Publishing, 2002), 21&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City History | url=http://mcivta.com/history/ | accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the city of [[Manchester]], and consisted of a shield in front of a [[golden eagle]]. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but has since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield features a ship on its upper half representing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolise the city's three rivers – the [[River Irwell|Irwell]], the [[River Irk|Irk]] and the [[River Medlock|Medlock]]. The bottom of the badge bears the motto "''Superbia in Proelio''", which translates as "Pride in Battle" in [[Latin]]. Above the eagle and shield are three stars, which are purely decorative.

On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/2016/07/02/mcfc-new-badge-is-here/1467452088949 |title=City's New Badge is Here! |work=mancity.com |date=2 July 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manchester City to design new badge following consultation with fans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/24/manchester-city-badge-design-fans-consultation |work=The Guardian |date=24 November 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|IPO]] when the design was trademarked on 22 December.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237 | title=Manchester City's new club badge design leaked online | publisher=BBC News| date=24 December 2015 | accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 December 2015 |accessdate=26 December 2015 |work=The Guardian |title=Manchester City unveil new club crest before home game against Sunderland |first=Niall |last=McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/26/manchester-city-unveil-new-club-crest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters ==
{{main|Manchester City F.C. supporters}}
Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester City's average attendances have been in the top six in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Top 30 English Football Clubs by League Attendances| work=footballeconomy.com attendance table 2002–2005 | url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_att_04.htm| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then Division Two, now [[EFL League One|Football League One]]), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer than 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Average Attendances – English Football Divisions – 1994/95–2004/05| work=footballeconomy.com division attendance table 1995–2005 | url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_att_01.htm| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and the club's recent trophies, that figure has ballooned to many times that size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Customer Success – Manchester City Football Club| work=Hewlett-Packard case study| url=http://h20219.www2.hp.com/services/cache/78471-0-0-225-121.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125201443/http://h20219.www2.hp.com/services/cache/78471-0-0-225-121.html| archivedate=25 November 2005| accessdate=4 April 2007 }} (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed from a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About MCFC Supporters Club| work=MCFC Supporters Club| url=http://mcfcsupportersclub.co.uk/about/| accessdate=19 April 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030214303/http://mcfcsupportersclub.co.uk/about/| archive-date=30 October 2016| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several [[fanzine]]s published by supporters; the longest running is ''[[King of the Kippax]]'' and it is the only one still published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King of the Kippax fanzine |url=http://kingkippax.blogspot.com/ |accessdate=13 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708045305/http://kingkippax.blogspot.com/ |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of "[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results "typical City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FA Cup preview| work=ESPN Star article| url=http://www.espnstar.com/facup/facup_gamedetails_1660559.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219190036/http://www.espnstar.com/facup/facup_gamedetails_1660559.html| archivedate=19 December 2007| accessdate=24 September 2009 }} (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Typical City!|work=Unofficial supporters homepage|url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/typical.html| accessdate=25 March 2006 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060111201056/http://www.uit.no/mancity/club/typical.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events that fans regard as "typical City" include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace|first=Dave |title=Century City – Manchester City Football Club 1957/58 |publisher=King of the Kippax |year=2007 |location=Leigh |isbn=978-0-9557056-0-1}} page ix&lt;/ref&gt; or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], a team two divisions lower.

Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], against whom they contest the [[Manchester derby]]. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves "supporters" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester [[postcode]] areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do You Come From Manchester? |work=Manchester Metropolitan University study |url=http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227194327/http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Man City also has a rivalry with that of [[Everton F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitterandblue.sbnation.com/2015/8/21/9185653/everton-manchester-city-a-historical-look|title=Everton – Manchester City: A Historical Look|website=Sb Nation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing [[inflatable]] objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the craze is that in a match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] chants from fans calling for the introduction of [[Imre Varadi]] as a substitute mutated into "Imre Banana". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]] as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at [[Grimsby Town]]), with the phenomenon reaching a peak at City's match at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 26 December 1988, a match declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Inflatables Craze| work=Manchester City Football Club Supporters' Homepage | url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/bananas.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990423121549/http://www.uit.no/mancity/bananas.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=23 April 1999| accessdate=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed [[The Poznań]], from fans of Polish club [[Lech Poznań]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Poles apart: how fans of Poznan inspired City's unlikely dance craze |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/poles-apart-how-fans-of-poznan-inspired-citys-unlikely-dance-craze-2270018.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=7 November 2011  |first=Jack |last=Pitt-Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership and finances ==
{{main|Manchester City F.C. ownership and finances}}

The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a [[private limited company]], with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.

Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),&lt;ref name="PLUS"&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City plc| work=PLUS Markets Group | url=http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/details.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336| accessdate=30 April 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205055003/http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/details.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=5 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6277502.stm |title=Thaksin completes Man City buyout |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=6 July 2007 | date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares, and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to "squeeze out" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Oak Chinnawat]] also became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] executive [[Garry Cook (CEO)|Garry Cook's]] appointment as executive chairman in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/10/manchestercity.premierleague|title=Wardle quits City|work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate=28 August 2008  | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | date=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which accounts were published as a public company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester City's losses trebled under Thaksin Shinawatra| work=The Telegraph | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/5137361/Manchester-Citys-losses-trebled-under-Thaksin-Shinawatra.html| accessdate =19 April 2017 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL0287604320070802 |title=Eriksson continues Man City spending |agency=Reuters   | accessdate=13 January 2008 | date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending in around £30&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=563047.html |title=Bojinov joins Man City |publisher=FIFA | accessdate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas over the previous few seasons net spending had been among the lowest in the division. A year later, this investment was itself dwarfed by larger sums. On 1 September 2008, [[Abu Dhabi]]-based [[Abu Dhabi United Group|Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited]] completed a takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200&amp;nbsp;million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer "deadline-day" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to [[gazump]] [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s protracted bid to sign [[Dimitar Berbatov]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee in excess of £30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;

Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed [[Robinho]] from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for a [[Progression of British football transfer record|British record transfer fee]] of £32.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;

The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year [[lease]] from [[Manchester City Council]]. It has been City's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when the club moved from [[Maine Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bailey |first=Chris |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/227/227642_why_blues_must_cash_in_on_name_game.html |title=Why Blues must cash in on name game |date=8 November 2006 |accessdate=22 April 2008 |work=Manchester Evening News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014114038/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/227/227642_why_blues_must_cash_in_on_name_game.html |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before moving to the stadium, Manchester City spent in excess of £30&amp;nbsp;million to convert it to football use. The pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand built.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester: A Football History'', p391.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in a [[friendly match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Man City vanquish Barca| work=BBC article | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/3139231.stm | accessdate=28 December 2005 | date=10 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. Current capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 61,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City seek stadium expansion to hold 61,000 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24489940 |publisher=BBC News |location=Manchester |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at [[Hyde Road Football Stadium]], its home for 36 years.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, ''The Football Grounds of Great Britain'', p62&lt;/ref&gt; A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the "Wembley of the North" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mancity.com/fans-and-community/club/club-history|title=Club History|publisher=Manchester City F.C.|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003.

Originally named '''Hotspur Football Club''', the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by [[Bobby Buckle]]. They were members of the Hotspur [[Cricket]] Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 1: A crowd walked across the muddy fields to watch the Hotspur play }} A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at [[All Hallows, Tottenham|All Hallows Church]], who became the first president of the club and its treasurer.

In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived [[Southern Alliance]].{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 3: Moneyball}}

The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 3: Moneyball}} Soon after, [[Frank Brettell]] became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed [[John Cameron (footballer born 1872)|John Cameron]], who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later.

===Early decades in the Football League (1908–1958)===
In 1908, the club was elected into the [[Football League Second Division]] and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in their first season, and finished runners-up in their first year in the league. In 1912, [[Peter McWilliam]] became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the [[1914–15 in English football|1914–15]] season when football was suspended due to the [[World War I|First World War]]. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ahalftimereport.com/2016/07/19/peter-mcwilliam-the-tottenham-boss-who-created-legends/ |title=Peter McWilliam: The Tottenham Boss Who Created Legends |date= 19 July 2016 |work=A Halftime Report|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ArthurGrimsdell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Spurs captain [[Arthur Grimsdell]] displaying the cup to fans on [[Tottenham High Road]] after the 1921 final]]
On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 1–0 in the [[1921 FA Cup Final|Cup Final]]. Spurs finished second to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the league in [[1921–22 in English football|1922]], but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the [[1927–28 in English football|1927–28 season]] after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 40s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the [[1933–34 in English football|1933–34]] and [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]] seasons.{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 8: Spurs Shot Themselves in the Foot}}

Former Spurs player [[Arthur Rowe]] became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as "[[push and run]]", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager.

[[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] took over as manager in October 1958. He would become the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1961]], the FA Cup in 1962 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1963]].&lt;ref name=""nicholson"/&gt; Nicholson signed [[Dave Mackay]] and [[John White (footballer born 1937)|John White]] in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and [[Jimmy Greaves]] in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the [[List of English football first tier top scorers|top tier of English football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/28/cristiano-ronaldo-can-match-magical-mark-set-jimmy-greaves/ |title=Special report: Jimmy Greaves pays tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo as Portuguese closes in on his magical mark |first=Jeremy|last= Wilson|date=28 February 2017 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Welch|2015|loc=Chapter 12: Going Up, Up, Up}}

==Stadia/playing grounds ==

===Early grounds===
Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of [[Tottenham Marshes]], where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 1: A crowd walked across the muddy fields to watch the Hotspur play }} Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt; The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0.{{sfn |The Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Herald|1921 |p=6 }} It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (then known as Royal Arsenal) leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topspurs.com/thfc-november.htm |publisher=topspurs.com |title=A Month in the Illustrious History of Spurs: November |first=Logan |last=Holmes |accessdate=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tottenham Hotspur vs Newton Heath January 1899.jpg|thumb|Northumberland Park, 28 January 1899, Spurs vs Newton Heath (later renamed [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]])]]
As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm, next to the railway line at [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]], at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged [[Threepence (British coin)|3d]] a game, raised to 6d for cup ties.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 2: Enclosure Changed the Game Forever }} The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired.{{sfn|The Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Herald|1921 |pp=22–23 }} In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs were forced to look for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/tottenham-hotspur-spurs-white-hart-lane-farewell-goodbye-diego-maradon-johan-cruyff-a7733846.html|title=White Hart Lane has seen Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff, but after 118 years Tottenham have outgrown it|first= Martin |last=Cloake |date=13 May 2017|publisher=The Independent |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Hart Lane ground was built on a disused nursery owned by the brewery [[Charringtons]] and located behind a [[public house]] named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators.&lt;ref name="stadium history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/the-stadium/history/ |title= History of White Hart Lane |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/spurs-v-notts-county-1899-030804/ |title=Spurs v Notts County 1899 |date= 3 August 2004 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the [[fee simple|freehold]] to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;

After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by [[Archibald Leitch]] being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;
[[File:White Hart Lane Aerial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aerial image of [[White Hart Lane]]. Redevelopment of this stadium began in early 1980s and completed in the late 1990s.]]

Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the [[Taylor Report]]'s recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant [[Sony]] [[Jumbotron]] TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings.&lt;ref name="stadium history2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/stadium-history-070704/ |title=Stadium History |date=7 July 2004 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen.&lt;ref name="stadium history2"/&gt;  Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.&lt;ref name="stadium history"/&gt;

By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|2012 London Olympic Stadium]] in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spurs1882.org/misc/WHL_EastStand2001_PlanningStatement.pdf |title=Proposed New East Stand Redevelopment for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |date=June 2001 |work=Spurs Since 1882 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ley"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/8036137/Tottenham-interested-in-making-London-2012-Olympic-Stadium-their-new-ground.html |title=Tottenham interested in making London 2012 Olympic Stadium their new ground |first= John |last=Ley|date=1 October 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the club settled on the [[Northumberland Development Project]], whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/tottenham-champions-league-fixtures-wembley-stadium |title=Tottenham Hotspur to play Champions League matches at Wembley |work=The Guardian |date=28 May 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic fixtures of the [[2016–17 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2016–17 season]] continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/15/tottenham-waste-no-time-white-hart-lane-demolition-work-begins/ |title=Tottenham waste no time as White Hart Lane demolition work begins |first=Mark |last=Molloy |date=15 May 2017 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/historic-update-spurs-new-stadium-13412817 |title=Historic update on Spurs new stadium site as last visual remnants of White Hart Lane disappear |first=Adam |last= Jones |date=31 July 2017|work=Football London|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7699135.stm|title=Tottenham reveal new ground plan|publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2008|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by [[Haringey Council]] in September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004120344/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/futureplans/news/stadium-plans-011010.html |title= Stadium Plans|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/futureplans/news/stadium-plans-011010.html |archivedate=4 October 2010 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed 20 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14996725.stm|title=Tottenham sign planning agreement to build new stadium|publisher=BBC|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest==
Since the 1921 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] has featured a [[cockerel]]. [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Harry Hotspur]], after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles,&lt;ref name="insall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planningservices.haringey.gov.uk/portal/servlets/AttachmentShowServlet?ImageName=748708 |title=Northumberland Development Project |date=September 2015 |work=Haringey Council |author=Donald Insall Associates|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also said to be fond of [[Cockfight|fighting cocks]] fitted with spurs.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt; The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock.&lt;ref name="insall"/&gt; A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35, and this 9-foot 6-inch figure was then placed on top of the [[White Hart Lane|West Stand]] the end of the 1909–10 season.&lt;ref name="insall"/&gt; Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/aug/31/theknowledge.sport |title=The most unlikely football bet to come off |author=James Dart |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The lions flanking the shield came from the Northumberland family (of which Harry Hotspur was a member). The castle is [[Bruce Castle]], 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the [[Seven Sisters, London|Seven Sisters]]. The arms featured the Latin motto ''Audere Est Facere'' (to dare is to do).&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;

In 1983, to overcome unauthorised [[copyright infringement|"pirate"]] merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red [[supporter|heraldic lions]] and the [[motto|motto scroll]]. This device appeared on most Spurs' playing kits for the next 23 years.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;

In 2006, in order to [[rebrand]] and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/4628886.stm |title=Tottenham unveil new club badge |publisher=BBC |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revamp showed to be more sleeker and elegant on an old-time football. The club claims that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/tottenham-hotspur-unveils-modernised-club-badge/536837 |title=Tottenham Hotspur unveils modernised club badge |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |publisher=Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club [[Fleet Spurs F.C.|Fleet Spurs]] to change their badge because its new design was "too similar" to the Tottenham crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24940529 |title=Tottenham Hotspur force Fleet Spurs badge redesign |work=''BBC News''|date=14 November 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kit==
The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=20–21}}  In 1884 or 1985, the club changed to a "quartered" kit similar to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] after watching them win in the [[1884 FA Cup Final]].{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=22}} After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the [[1889–90 in English football|1889–90 season]]. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'.{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|pages=24–25}} Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.&lt;ref name="historickits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Tottenham_Hotspur/Tottenham_Hotspur.htm |title=Historical Kits&amp;nbsp;– Tottenham Hotspur |work=''historicalkits.co.uk'' |publisher=Historic Football Kits |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–99 season]], their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].{{sfn|Shakeshaft|Burney|Evans|2018|page=26}} White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname "The Lilywhites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://premierskillsenglish.britishcouncil.org/clubs/tottenham-hotspur |title=Tottenham Hotspur |work=Premier Skill English |accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, after they had won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.  In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.&lt;ref name="historickits"/&gt;

In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on [[Seven Sisters Road]], HR Brookes.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 2: Enclosure Changed the Game Forever }} In the 1920s, [[Bukta]] produced the jerseys for the club.

Historically, the club had a significant [[Jewish]] following from the Jewish communities in East and Northeast London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/how-tottenham-became-the-jewish-football-team-1.53784 |title=Spurs and the Jews: the how, the why and the when |first1=Martin |last1=Cloake|first2= Alan|last2= Fisher|date=6 October 2016 |work=The Jewish Chronicle |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), it is nevertheless identified as a Jewish club by rival fans.{{sfn|Cloake|Fisher|2016|loc=Chapter 10: Does your rabbi know you’re here? }} This has led to much [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] provocation with chants of "[[Yids]]" or "Yiddos" against Tottenham supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/28/newsstory.sport2|work=The Guardian |location=UK |title=Alive and unchecked&amp;nbsp;– a wave of anti-Jewish hate|first=Anna|last=Kessel | date=28 October 2007|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/david-baddiel-so-you-think-weve-kicked-racism-out-of-english-football-614251.html|work=The Independent |location=UK |last=Baddiel|first=David|title=So you think we've kicked racism out of English football | date=17 October 2002|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the "Yids" or "Yid Army" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iye9CDk0X_IC&amp;pg=PA244 |title=Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe |editor=Michael Brenner, Gideon Reuveni |pages=241–245 |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans view adopting "Yid" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629172805/http://timesonline.typepad.com/david_aaronovitch/2007/03/aaronovitch_yid.html|title=Aaronovitch yiddos|work=The Times |location=London |date=18 March 2007 |archivedate=29 June 2007|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/david_aaronovitch/2007/03/aaronovitch_yid.html|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "Yid" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans "legitimis[es] references to Jews in football",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/lets-forget-opposition-supporters-even-as-a-term-of-endearment-yid-army-is-offensive/|title=Let's forget opposition supporters.

===Fan culture===
There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as "[[Glory Glory (football chant)|Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur]]". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the [[Double (association football)|Double]] in [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1960–61]], and the club entered the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time. Their first opponents were [[Górnik Zabrze]], the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to describe them as "they were no angels". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into [[togas]], sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing [[biblical]]-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of "[[Glory Glory (football chant)|Glory Glory Hallelujah]]", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glory Glory Nights:The Official Story of Tottenham Hotspur in Europe|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/12/glory-glory-nights-official-story-tottenham-hotspur-europe|website=New Statesman|first=Martin|last=Cloake|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: {{quotation|A new sound was heard in English football in the 1961–2 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I don't know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling.|Bill Nicholson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spurs V Quarabag-Back in Time|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/qarabag-home-back-in-time-170915/|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There had been a number of incidences of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in [[Rotterdam]] at the [[1974 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Feyenoord]], and again during the [[1983–84 UEFA Cup]] matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jun/19/euro2000.sport3 |title=England told: more rioting and you're out |first=Vivek |last=Chaudhary|date=19 June 2000|work=The Guardian |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidences of hooliganism continued to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/10-fans-knifed-in-chelsea-battle-7210890.html |title=10 fans knifed in Chelsea battle |first=Richard |last=Edwards|date= 12 March 2007 |work=London Evening Standard|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.thecnj.com/camden_review/news/2010/aug/hooligans-%E2%80%98put-their-hoods-and-attacked-pub%E2%80%99 |title=Hooligans 'put up their hoods and attacked pub' |work=The Camden Review |date= 13 August 2010 |first=Róisín |last=Gadelrab|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
{{main|North London derby|Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry}}
Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with [[North London derby|north London rivals]] Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]], [[Plumstead]] to [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]], and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.{{sfn|Goodwin|2003|pages=30, 34–34}} They also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |title=Rivalry uncovered!

==Social responsibility==
The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with [[Haringey Council]] and the [[Metropolitan Housing Trust]] and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation/news/foundationnews_haringeymultisportsummercoachingprogramme.html |title=Haringley Multi-Sport Summer Coaching Programme |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322010725/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation/news/foundationnews_haringeymultisportsummercoachingprogramme.html |archive-date=22 March 2011 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalliteracytrust.org.uk/football/FootballClubs/spurs.html |title=Promoting literacy through the power of sport |publisher=National Literacy Trust&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605125334/http://www.nationalliteracytrust.org.uk/football/FootballClubs/spurs.html |archive-date=5 June 2009 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] when it was launched at [[10 Downing Street]] in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs/News/Archive/academy_news_2007_2_440.page |title=Tottenham Hotspur Foundation receives strong political backing |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |date=4 February 2007|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity [[SOS Children's Villages UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/tottenham-sos-partnership-270307.htm |title=Tottenham Hotspur teams up with SOS Children |date=27 March 2007 |publisher=SOS Children's Villages |access-date=30 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522083521/http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/tottenham-sos-partnership-270307.htm |archive-date=22 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Player fines will go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa with the funds being used to cover the running costs as well as in support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentgiving.com/files/IG_Prem_giving_league_07.pdf |title=The Intelligentgiving.com Premiership Giving League 2007 |publisher=Intelligentgiving.com |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5&amp;nbsp;million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | agency = [[Press Association]] | url = http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2007-03-26-Chelsea-FC-near-bottom-of-charitable-donations-league | title = Chelsea FC 'near bottom' of charitable donations league | date = 26 March 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052131/http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2007-03-26-Chelsea-FC-near-bottom-of-charitable-donations-league | archivedate = 6 December 2008 | df = dmy-all |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compared to donations of £9,763 in 2005–06.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/docstore/tottenham_ar2006_72dpi.pdf |title=Tottenham Hotspur PLC Annual Report 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409101702/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/docstore/tottenham_ar2006_72dpi.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2008 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The football club is one of the highest profile participants in the [[10:10]] project which encourages individuals, businesses and organisations to take action on environmental issues. They joined in 2009 in a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint. To do this they upgraded their lights to more efficient models, they turned down their heating dials and took less short-haul flights among a host of other things.&lt;ref name="global1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1010global.org/uk/spurs |title=Case study: Tottenham Hotspur &amp;#124; 10:10 |publisher=1010global.org |accessdate=17 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407015727/http://www.1010global.org/uk/spurs |archivedate=7 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After working with 10:10 for one year, they reported that they had reduced their carbon emissions by 14%.&lt;ref name="global1"/&gt;

In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing (100 out of 200), but this was reduced to 0 out of 285&lt;ref name="insidehousing.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/spurs-given-green-light-to-drop-affordable-homes/6520463.article/|title=Spurs given green light to drop affordable homes|publisher=insidehousing.co.uk|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814152927/http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/spurs-given-green-light-to-drop-affordable-homes/6520463.article/|archivedate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Spurs suggested that the development was not financially viable with this obligation. In addition, a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m.&lt;ref name="insidehousing.co.uk"/&gt;  This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/30/tottenham-new-stadium-fury-regeneration |title=Tottenham's new stadium masterplan: the fury amid the regeneration|first= David |last=Conn|date= 30 October 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2016/12/09/spurs-new-stadium-provides-3500-jobs-boost-will-pump-293m-economy/|title=Spurs new stadium provides 3,500 jobs boost and will pump £293m into economy |date=9 December 2016 |work=Inside World Football |first=Paul |last=Nicholson |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714032108/http://tottenhamhotspur.com/new-scheme/project-update/ |archivedate=14 July 2015 |title=Project Update |url=http://tottenhamhotspur.com/new-scheme/project-update/ |deadurl=yes |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club |accessdate=30 June 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/tottenham_illustrative_map.pdf |title=Tottenham is the next chapter of london's regeneration story and boasts |work= Haringey Council |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tottenham Hotspur Ladies==
{{Main|Tottenham Hotspur L.F.C.}}
Tottenham's women's team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991–92 season and played in the [[London and South East Women's Regional Football League]] (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 2007–08. In the 2016–17 season they won the [[FA Women's Premier League Southern Division]] and a subsequent playoff, gaining promotion to the [[FA Women's Super League 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/spursladies/news/spurs-ladies-win-play-off-290517/|title=Spurs Ladies all set for Women's Super League 29 May 2017 – News |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arsenal Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London]], England, that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of [[English football league system|English football]]. It [[List of English football clubs by elite honours won|has won]] 13 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], a record 13 [[FA Cup]]s, two [[EFL Cup|League Cups]], the [[Football League Centenary Trophy|League Centenary Trophy]], 15 [[FA Community Shield]]s, one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and one [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]].

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join [[English Football League|The Football League]], in 1893, and they reached the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division,&lt;ref name="RSSSF_Div_Movements"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=James|last2=Heneghan|first2=Michael|last3=Orford|first3=Stuart|last4=Culliton|first4=Eoin|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888–2016|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=5 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html |archivedate=5 August 2016|date=23 June 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history.&lt;ref name="RSSSF1stLevelAllTime"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pietarinen|first1=Heikki|title=England – First Level All-Time Tables|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=24 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824181412/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engalltime.html|archivedate=24 August 2017|date=24 August 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]], they won their first [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]]. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.&lt;ref name="Independent: Hodgson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodgson|first1=Guy|title=Football: How consistency and caution made Arsenal England's greatest|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-how-consistency-and-caution-made-arsenal-englands-greatest-team-of-the-20th-century-1133020.html|accessdate=13 May 2016|work=The Independent|date=17 December 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192410/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-how-consistency-and-caution-made-arsenal-englands-greatest-team-of-the-20th-century-1133020.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Chapman]] won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the [[WM formation]], [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlights]], and [[Squad number (association football)#First use of numbers|shirt numbers]],&lt;ref name="Herbert Chapman Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herbert Chapman|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/herbert-chapman|publisher=National Football Museum|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal's kit. [[Arsène Wenger]] was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won [[List of FA Cup winning managers|a record]] 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an [[Football records in England|English record]] for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,&lt;ref name="49 Unbeaten"&gt;{{cite web|title=49 Unbeaten|url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/the-unbeaten-record|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving the nickname [[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]], and a special gold Premier League trophy.&lt;ref name="Special gold trophy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3724897.stm |title=Special trophy for Gunners |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2004 |accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich munitions]] workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], becoming close neighbours of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and creating the [[North London derby]]. In 2006, they moved to the nearby [[Emirates Stadium]]. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the [[Deloitte Football Money League|ninth highest-earning]] football club in the world, earned €487.6m in [[2016–17 Arsenal F.C. season|2016–17]] season.&lt;ref name="Deloitte Football Money League"/&gt; Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world.&lt;ref name="Deloitte Football Money League"/&gt; In 2018, [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|Forbes estimated]] the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes2018/&gt;

In October 1886, Scotsman [[David Danskin]] and his fellow 15 munitions workers in [[Woolwich]], now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with each member contributing sixpence and Danskin adding another three shillings to help form the club.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{efn|Woolwich and Plumstead were officially part of [[Kent]] until the creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889.

Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with [[English Football League|The Football League]] when the club ascended later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|last2=Andrews|first2=Mark|title=How Arsenal's Name Changed – Woolwich Arsenal|url=http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7728|website=The Arsenal History|accessdate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205024313/http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7728|archivedate=5 February 2016|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=.

Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Sally|title=Woolwich Arsenal 1910 – the arrival of Hall and Norris|url=http://www.wrightanddavis.co.uk/Norris/SLWA10.html|website=wrightanddavis.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410074122/http://www.wrightanddavis.co.uk/Norris/SLWA10.html |archivedate=10 April 2016|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=.

In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|last2=Andrews|first2=Mark|title=How Arsenal's Name Changed – The Arsenal|url=http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7730|website=The Arsenal History|accessdate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213131650/http://thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7730|archivedate=13 February 2014|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=. ''Woolwich Arsenal FC: 1893–1915 The club that changed football''|pp=43–64}} In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], into the [[1919–20 Football League|newly enlarged]] First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of [[1914–15 Football League#Second Division|1914–15]]. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.{{efn|It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)]] for more details. This speculation ranges from political machinations to outright bribery; no evidence of any wrongdoing has ever been found.

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first [[crest (sports)|crest]] featured three [[cannon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]] (nowadays transferred to the [[coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich]]). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannons.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest |title=The Crest |publisher=Arsenal F.C |accessdate=11 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812085724/http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest |archivedate=12 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.&lt;ref name="crest"/&gt;

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit -'' "victory comes from harmony" – coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.&lt;ref name="crest"/&gt; For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold "unofficial" Arsenal merchandise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a [[sans-serif]] typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a [[monogram]] of the club's initials in red on a white background.&lt;ref name="shirt badge"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.&lt;ref name="artdeco"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname "The Gunners", in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="shirt badge"/&gt;

In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 [[oak]] leaves to the right and 15 [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto "Forward" at the bottom of the crest.&lt;ref name="125th anniversary crest"&gt;{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.{{sfn|Soar|Tyler|2011|ps=. ''Arsenal 125 Years in the Making: The Official Illustrated History 1886–2011''|p=20}} The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arsenal home kit|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/the-arsenal-kit|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historicalkits"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.&lt;ref name="kitdesign"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name="kitdesign"/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt;

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;&lt;ref name="kitdesign"/&gt; in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Braga|Sporting Clube de Braga]]'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ''Os Arsenalistas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the [[1971 FA Cup Final]] as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the [[Double (association football)|double]] for the first time in their history.&lt;ref name=cupfinal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/index.html|title=FA Cup Finals|accessdate=4 October 2013|work=Historical Football Kits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal reached the [[1972 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]] wearing their "lucky" yellow and blue strip,&lt;ref name=cupfinal/&gt; which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Stadiums==
[[File:Manor Ground, Woolwich Arsenal vs. Everton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manor Ground (Plumstead)|Manor Ground]], Woolwich Arsenal vs. [[Everton F.C.]]]]
Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on [[Plumstead Common]], then at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]]. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]], upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.&lt;ref name="conservation_plan"/&gt; The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.&lt;ref name="conservation_plan"/&gt;

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.&lt;ref name="conservation_plan"/&gt; These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as "Gooners", the name derived from the team's nickname, "The Gunners". The fanbase is large, generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/prematt.htm?comp=1 | title=Attendances 2007/08 | author=Kempster, Tony | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance.&lt;ref name="All Time League Attendance"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Time League Attendance Records|url=http://www.nufc.com/2015-16html/attendance-all-time.html|website=nufc.com|publisher=NUFC|accessdate=6 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406083542/http://www.nufc.com/2015-16html/attendance-all-time.html |archivedate=6 April 2016|date=22 September 2015}} Please note that some pre-war attendance figures used by this source were estimates and may not be entirely accurate.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ger.1/year/2010/german-bundesliga?cc=5901 |title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance&amp;nbsp;– 2010–11 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada10-11/05/17/n110517117527.html |title=Camp Nou league attendances rise by 2.7% |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/eng.1/year/2010/barclays-premier-league?cc=5901 |title= Barclays Premier League Stats: Team Attendance&amp;nbsp;– 2010–11 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ESP.1/year/2010/spanish-primera-division?cc=5901 |title=Spanish La Liga Stats: Team Attendance&amp;nbsp;– 2010–11 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as [[Canonbury]] and [[Barnsbury]], mixed areas such as [[Islington]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[Highbury]], and the adjacent [[London Borough of Camden]], and largely working-class areas such as [[Finsbury Park (district)|Finsbury Park]] and [[Stoke Newington]], has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring [[London Borough of Hackney]] and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from [[Wembley Park]], North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby [[Archway, London|Archway]] area having a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.

[[File:Arsenal Flag (7100433493).jpg|thumb|Arsenal supporters]]
Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]").

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc |format=Word document | title=Fans Report 2006/2007 | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=7 September 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910062129/http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc| archivedate= 10 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million.&lt;ref name="SPORT+MARKT analysis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=Ashling|title=Liverpool lag in fight for global fan supremacy as TV row grows|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3192868.ece|work=The Times|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name="Deloitte Football Money League"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deloitte Football Money League|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/sports-business-group/uk-deloitte-sport-football-money-league-2016.pdf|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager [[George Allison]] was given a speaking part.&lt;ref name="atthemovies"/&gt; More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/nick.hornby | title=Nick Hornby |work=The Guardian | date=22 July 2008 | accessdate=7 September 2008 | quote=Critically acclaimed and commercial dynamite, Fever Pitch helped to make football trendy and explain its appeal to the soccerless | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was twice adapted for the cinema&amp;nbsp;– the [[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|1997 British film]] focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a [[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|2005 American version]] features a fan of baseball's [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Glen|title=Fever Pitch|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=Time (magazine)|date=5 July 2010|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/07/06/top-10-soccer-movies/slide/fever-pitch-1997/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a [[defender (association football)|defensive]] and "boring" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s;&lt;ref name="noble"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,353528,00.html|title=Boring, Boring Arsenal|last=Noble|first=Kate|date=22 September 2002|work=Time (magazine)|accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3037789.stm | title=No more boring, boring Arsenal | first=John |last=May |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=19 May 2003 | accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; many comedians, such as [[Eric Morecambe]], made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[offside trap]], in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[striptease]] routine.&lt;ref name="atthemovies"&gt;{{cite web

==History==

===Early years (1878–1945)===
{{Main article|History of Manchester United F.C. (1878–1945)}}

[[File:Manchester United FC League Performance.svg|thumb|A chart showing the progress of Manchester United through the [[English football league system]] from joining as Newton Heath in [[1892–93 Football League|1892–93]] to the present|alt=refer to caption]]
Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (LYR) depot at [[Newton Heath]].&lt;ref name="barnes_8"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]' reserve team.&lt;ref&gt;James (2008), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, the club had become a founding member of [[The Combination]], a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed [[Football Alliance]], which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.&lt;ref name="barnes_8"/&gt; After two seasons, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref name="barnes_8"/&gt;

[[File:Man.utd 1905-06 dailygraph.jpg|thumb|left|The Manchester United team at the start of the [[1905–06 Manchester United F.C. season|1905–06 season]], in which they were runners-up in the Second Division|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a football team lining up before a match. Four players, wearing dark shirts, light shorts and dark socks, are seated. Four more players are standing immediately behind them, and three more are standing on a higher level on the back row. Two men in suits are standing on either side of the players.]]
In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2670|1902|r=-4}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|group=nb}} – the club was served with a [[liquidation|winding-up order]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell &amp; Meek (1996), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Harry Stafford]] found four local businessmen, including [[John Henry Davies]] (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;&lt;ref name="barnes_9"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.&lt;ref&gt;James (2008), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Sources are divided on the exact date of the meeting and subsequent name change. Whilst official club sources claim that it occurred on 26 April, the meeting was reported by the ''Manchester Evening Chronicle'' in its edition of 25 April, suggesting it was indeed on 24 April.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Ernest Mangnall]], who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a [[yo-yo club]], achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for [[James W. Gibson]], who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.&lt;ref name="barnes_12"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1938–39 Manchester United F.C. season|1938–39 season]], the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.&lt;ref name="barnes_12"/&gt;

===Busby years (1945–1969)===
{{Main article|History of Manchester United F.C. (1945–1969)}}
[[File:Busby babes 1955.jpg|thumb|The Busby Babes in Denmark in 1955|alt=A black-and-white photograph of several people in suits and overcoats on the steps of an aircraft.]]
In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of [[Matt Busby]], who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in [[1948 FA Cup Final|1948]]. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2006), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] the same opportunity the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Glanville |title=The great Chelsea surrender |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,762-1586242,00.html |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |location=London |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; En route to the semi-final, which they lost to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], which remains the club's biggest victory on record.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against [[Red Star Belgrade]], the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The [[Munich air disaster]] of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players&amp;nbsp;– [[Geoff Bent]], [[Roger Byrne]], [[Eddie Colman]], [[Duncan Edwards]], [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]], [[David Pegg]], [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[Billy Whelan]]&amp;nbsp;– and injured several more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1958: United players killed in air disaster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2535000/2535961.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 February 1958 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WillemIIManchesterUnited1963c.jpg|thumb|Manchester United (1963)]]
Assistant manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the [[1958 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]], which they lost to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. In recognition of the team's tragedy, [[UEFA]] invited the club to compete in the [[1958–59 European Cup]] alongside eventual League champions [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.&lt;ref&gt;White, Jim (2008), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as [[Denis Law]] and [[Pat Crerand]], who combined with the next generation of youth players – including [[George Best]] – to win the FA Cup in [[1963 FA Cup Final|1963]]. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] 4–1 in the [[1968 European Cup Final|final]]&lt;ref name="barnes_18-19"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; with a team that contained three [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballers of the Year]]: [[Bobby Charlton]], Denis Law and George Best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Rob |last1=Moore |first2=Karel |last2=Stokkermans |date=11 December 2009 |title=European Footballer of the Year ("Ballon d'Or") |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/europa-poy.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They then represented Europe in the [[1968 Intercontinental Cup]] against Estudiantes of Argentina, but lost the tie after losing the first leg in Buenos Aires, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player [[Wilf McGuinness]].&lt;ref name="barnes_19"/&gt;

Following an eighth-place finish in the [[1969–70 Manchester United F.C. season|1969–70 season]] and a poor start to the [[1970–71 Manchester United F.C. season|1970–71 season]], Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, [[Frank O'Farrell]] was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18&amp;nbsp;months before being replaced by [[Tommy Docherty]] in December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2006), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.&lt;ref name="barnes_18-19"/&gt; The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in [[1976 FA Cup Final|1976]], but were beaten by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. They reached the final again in [[1977 FA Cup Final|1977]], beating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.&lt;ref name="barnes_19"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1977: Manchester United sack manager |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2492000/2492743.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 July 1977 |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dave Sexton]] replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Gordon McQueen]], [[Gary Bailey]], and [[Ray Wilkins]], the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]]. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.&lt;ref name="barnes_20"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Ron Atkinson]], who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign [[Bryan Robson]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in [[1983 FA Cup Final|1983]] and [[1985 FA Cup Final|1985]]. In [[1985–86 Manchester United F.C. season|1985–86]], after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.&lt;ref name="barnes_20-21"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester United won the league again in the [[1999–2000 FA Premier League|1999–2000]] and [[2000–01 FA Premier League|2000–01]] seasons.

==Crest and colours==
[[File:Manchester United Badge 1960s-1973.png|thumb|Manchester United badge in the 1960s|alt=A football crest. In the centre is a shield with a ship in full sail above a red field with three diagonal black lines. Either side of the shield are two stylised roses, separating two scrolls. The upper scroll is red and reads "Manchester United" in black type, while the lower scroll is white with "Football Club" also written in black.]]
The club crest is derived from the [[Manchester City Council#Coat of arms|Manchester City Council coat of arms]], although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.&lt;ref name="Barnes_49"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The devil stems from the club's nickname "The Red Devils"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.&lt;ref name="Barnes_49"/&gt;

Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Angus | first=J. Keith | year=1879 | title=The Sportsman's Year-Book for 1880 | publisher=Cassell, Petter, Galpin &amp; Co. | page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]].&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1894–96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"/&gt; which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"/&gt;

After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"/&gt; Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red "V" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the [[1909 FA Cup Final]]. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"/&gt; For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.&lt;ref name="Barnes_48"/&gt; The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks were sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.&lt;ref name="1819home"&gt;{{cite news |title=Adidas launches new United home kit for 2018/19 |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/adidas-launches-new-manchester-united-home-kit-for-2018-19-season |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 July 2018 |accessdate=17 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Alex Ferguson's ability to play the generation game is vital to Manchester United's phenomenal success |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8725483/Sir-Alex-Fergusons-ability-to-play-the-generation-game-is-vital-to-Manchester-Uniteds-phenomenal-success.html |first=Mark | last=Ogden |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current home kit is a red shirt with black stripes gradually getting thicker towards the base and the trademark Adidas [[three stripes]] in black on the shoulders, black shorts, and red socks with black tops and gradual stripes in between.&lt;ref name="1819home" /&gt;

The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season,&lt;ref&gt;Devlin (2005), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reds unveil new away kit |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2011/Jul/manchester-united-unveil-new-away-kit.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=13.04.96 Manchester United's grey day at The Dell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2 |first=Lee |last=Sharpe |author-link=Lee Sharpe |work=The Guardian |date=15 April 2006 |accessdate=21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as "Manchester United", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin (2005), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name="1415blue"&gt;{{cite news |title=United reveal blue third kit for 2014/15 season |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jul/New-Manchester-United-third-kit-press-release.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin (2005), pp. 154–159.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from 2008–09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the [[1967–68 European Cup]] success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New blue kit for 08/09 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2008/Aug/New-blue-kit-for-0809.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1878–1893: North Road===
{{main|North Road (football ground)}}
Newton Heath initially played on a field on [[North Road (football ground)|North Road]], close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.&lt;ref name="white_21"&gt;White, Jim (2008) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;James (2008), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 4 March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Shury &amp; Landamore (2005), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Shury &amp; Landamore (2005), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1893–1910: Bank Street Ground===
{{main|Bank Street (football ground)}}
In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary [[A. H. Albut]] procured the use of the [[Bank Street (football ground)|Bank Street ground]] in [[Clayton, Greater Manchester|Clayton]].&lt;ref name="shury_21-22"/&gt; It initially had no stands, by the start of the [[1893–94 Newton Heath F.C. season|1893–94 season]], two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the "Bradford end". At the opposite end, the "Clayton end", the ground had been "built up, thousands thus being provided for".&lt;ref name="shury_21-22"&gt;Shury &amp; Landamore (2005), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw [[Alf Farman]] score a [[hat-trick]], Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] three weeks later.&lt;ref name="shury_21-22"/&gt; In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the [[Broughton Rangers]] [[rugby league]] club, and put up another stand on the "reserved side" (as distinct from the "popular side"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;Shury &amp; Landamore (2005), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at [[Harpurhey]] for the next reserves game against Padiham.&lt;ref&gt;Shury &amp; Landamore (2005), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.&lt;ref name="inglis_234"&gt;Inglis (1996), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.&lt;ref name="inglis_234"/&gt;

===1910–present: Old Trafford===
{{main|Old Trafford}}
Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;&lt;ref name="inglis_234"/&gt; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, [[Old Trafford]] was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] drew 76,962&amp;nbsp;spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Rollin and Rollin, pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the [[War Damage Commission]] in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its "home" games at Manchester City's [[Maine Road]] ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.&lt;ref&gt;White, John (2007), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a [[cantilever]]ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the [[1993–94 Manchester United F.C. season|1993–94 season]].&lt;ref name="barnes_19"/&gt; First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}} pylons were erected, each housing 54&amp;nbsp;individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taylor Report]]'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 3–0 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4820120.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Report: United 4 Blackburn 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2007/Mar/Report-United-4-Blackburn-1.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216043425/http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2007/Mar/Report-United-4-Blackburn-1.aspx |archive-date=16 December 2011 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.&lt;ref name="inside_united"&gt;Morgan (2010), pp. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="record_gate"&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=OT100 #9: Record gate |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2009/Nov/OT100-9-Record-gate.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Barclays Premier League Stats: Team Attendance – 2012–13 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/23/statistics/performance?season=2012 |work=ESPN FC |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance – 2012–13 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/german-bundesliga/10/statistics/performance?season=2012 |work=ESPN FC |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spanish La Liga Stats: Team Attendance – 2012–13 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/statistics/performance?season=2012 |work=ESPN FC |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while [[Liverpool]] was a major port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Finlo |last=Rohrer |title=Scouse v Manc |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6956608.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 August 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and European competitions; and between them they have won [[List of English football champions|38 league titles]], 8 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], 4 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups]], 4 [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, 19 [[FA Cup]]s, 13 [[EFL Cup|League Cups]], 1 [[FIFA Club World Cup]], 1 [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and 36 [[FA Community Shield]]s.&lt;ref name="skysports.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11715/10676765/leeds-united-englands-13th-biggest-club-according-to-sky-sports-study |title=Leeds United England's 12th biggest club, according to Sky Sports study |work=Sky Sports |first=Adam |last=Smith |date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Liverpool v Manchester United: The bitter rivalry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19653230|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which club has won the most trophies in Europe|url=http://talksport.com/football/which-club-has-won-most-trophies-europe-most-successful-clubs-best-leagues-revealed|accessdate=26 September 2015|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the association football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football.&lt;ref name=TelLivMan&gt;{{cite news |title=The 20 biggest rivalries in world football ranked – Liverpool vs Manchester Utd|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/11484651/The-20-biggest-rivalries-in-world-football-ranked.html?frame=3239123 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 March 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianFanCensus&gt;{{cite news |first=Tanya |last=Aldred |title=Rivals uncovered|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/22/newsstory.sport11|publisher=The Guardian |date=22 January 2004 |accessdate=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/7308778.stm |title=Interview: Ryan Giggs |work=[[Football Focus]] |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 March 2008 |accessdate=22 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-remain-manchester-uniteds-biggest-rival-says-ryan-giggs-8390079.html |title=Liverpool remain Manchester United's 'biggest rival' says Ryan Giggs |publisher=The Independent |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleacher&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1867347-the-7-greatest-rivalries-in-club-football-from-boca-to-the-bernabeu/page/4 |title=The 7 Greatest Rivalries in Club Football: From Boca to the Bernabeu |publisher=The Bleacher Report |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Roses Rivalry" with Leeds stems from the [[Wars of the Roses]], fought between the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]], with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning (1999), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers [[Alex Ferguson]] and [[Arsène Wenger]], have battled for the [[Premier League]] title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal-world.co.uk/head_to_head/arsenal/vs/manchester_united/index.shtml|title=Arsenal v Manchester United head-to-head record|publisher=Arsenal official web|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/31/sir-alex-ferguson-arsene-wenger-rivalry|title=Rivalry between Arsène Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson unmatched in sport|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 January 2010|accessdate=24 April 2013|last1=Hayward|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global brand==

Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by [[Brand Finance]], valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412&amp;nbsp;million – an increase of £39&amp;nbsp;million on the previous year, valuing it at £11&amp;nbsp;million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 30 Football Club Brands |url=http://www.brandfinance.com/images/upload/top_30_european_football_brands_2011_final_website.pdf |publisher=Brand Finance |accessdate=4 October 2011 |date=September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United Tops The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2012/07/16/manchester-united-tops-the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams/ |work=Forbes |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2012 |first=Kurt |last=Badenhausen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).&lt;ref name="Deloitte_money_league"&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid becomes the first sports team in the world to generate €400m in revenues as it tops Deloitte Football Money League |url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805224812/http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/d039400401a17210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm |work=Deloitte |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2010 |archivedate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3&amp;nbsp;billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3&amp;nbsp;billion – $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.&lt;ref name="bstonfrbs"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Ozanian |title=Manchester United Becomes First Team Valued At $3 Billion |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/01/27/manchester-united-becomes-first-team-valued-at-3-billion/ |work=Forbes |date=27 January 2013 |accessdate=29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Mike |last=Ozanian |title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2017 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2017/06/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2017/ |work=Forbes |date=6 June 2017 |access-date=13 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.&lt;ref name="barnes_52"/&gt; The "iconic" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded "[[catenaccio]]" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) "captured the imagination of the English footballing public".&lt;ref name="hamil_116"&gt;Hamil (2008), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the "[[Fifth Beatle]]" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.&lt;ref name="hamil_116"/&gt;

As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.&lt;ref&gt;Hamil (2008), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Hamil (2008), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham fever grips Japan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2999514.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 June 2003 |accessdate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the [[BSkyB]] broadcasting deal.&lt;ref&gt;Hamil (2008), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51&amp;nbsp;million, compared to £42.5&amp;nbsp;million at Chelsea, £39.3&amp;nbsp;million at Liverpool, £34&amp;nbsp;million at Arsenal and £27.9&amp;nbsp;million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303&amp;nbsp;million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Hamil (2008), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, [[MUTV (Manchester United F.C.)|MUTV]] – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.&lt;ref name="hamil_126"/&gt;

In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp Electronics]] became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when [[Vodafone]] agreed a four-year, £30&amp;nbsp;million deal.&lt;ref name="shirt_sponsorship"&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Ducker |title=Manchester United show financial muscle after signing record £80m shirt contract |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article6426463.ece |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |location=London |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vodafone agreed to pay £36&amp;nbsp;million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.&lt;ref name="shirt_sponsorship"/&gt;

==Ownership and finances==
{{See also|Glazer ownership of Manchester United}}
Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form.&lt;ref name="barnes_9"/&gt; In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.&lt;ref name="barnes_9"/&gt; After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.&lt;ref name="barnes_12"/&gt; Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Crick &amp; Smith (1990), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,&lt;ref&gt;Crick &amp; Smith (1990), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; but the position of chairman passed to former player [[Harold Hardman]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Jim (2008), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson &amp; Goddard (2004), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; [[Martin Edwards]] went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.&lt;ref name="knighton_bid"&gt;{{cite news|title=1989: Man U sold in record takeover deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_2499000/2499267.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=24 June 2010 |date=18 August 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.&lt;ref name="knighton_bid"/&gt; In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to [[Michael Knighton]] for £20&amp;nbsp;million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.&lt;ref name="knighton_bid"/&gt;

Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref&gt;Dobson &amp; Goddard (2004), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[BSkyB|British Sky Broadcasting]] Corporation. This resulted in the formation of ''Shareholders United Against Murdoch'' – now the ''Manchester United Supporters' Trust'' – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any [[hostile takeover]]. The Manchester United board accepted a £623&amp;nbsp;million offer,&lt;ref&gt;Bose (2007), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; but the takeover was blocked by the [[Competition Commission (United Kingdom)|Monopolies and Mergers Commission]] at the final hurdle in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (2007), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, [[John Magnier]] and [[J.

In May 2005, [[Malcolm Glazer]] purchased the 28.7&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800&amp;nbsp;million (then approx. $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4550141.stm |title=Glazer Man Utd stake exceeds 75% |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Glazer gets 98% of Man Utd shares |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4629401.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the club announced a £660&amp;nbsp;million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62&amp;nbsp;million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/archive/archive_2006_jul_08.htm |title=Glazers Tighten Grip On United With Debt Refinancing |work=The Political Economy of Football |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refinancing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester United reveal refinancing plans |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2006/0718/manunited2.html |publisher=RTÉ (Raidió Teilifís Éireann) |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105215252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2006/0718/manunited2.html |archivedate=5 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, with debts of £716.5&amp;nbsp;million ($1.17&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United debt hits £716m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8470595.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504&amp;nbsp;million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509&amp;nbsp;million owed to international banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United to raise £500m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8451848.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Wilson |title=Manchester United raise £504m in bond issue |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8475317.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's [[Trafford Training Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Man Utd 4–0 Hull |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8472354.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prime Minister Gordon Brown warns football over debts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8479331.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath.

Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], five [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shields]] (one shared), one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], one [[UEFA Super Cup]] and one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]].

The club holds the record for most top-division titles (20) – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and FA Community Shields (21).

In winning the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the "[[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|European Treble]]" of [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup/UEFA Champions League]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League]] after [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2017/May/Manchester-United-win-the-Europa-League-after-beating-Ajax-in-the-final-in-Stockholm-24-May-2017.aspx?LP|title=Manchester United win the UEFA Europa League |publisher=manutd.com|date=24 May 2017|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ts_unique"&gt;{{cite web |title=Europa League final: Manchester United on the brink of unique achievement no other English club could ever match |url=http://talksport.com/football/europa-league-final-manchester-united-brink-unique-achievement-no-other-english-club-could |publisher=talkSPORT |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=28 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chelsea Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[London]], England, that competes in the [[Premier League]], the highest tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. The club has won eight League titles, eight [[FA Cup]]s, five [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]s, four [[FA Community Shield]]s, two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]s, one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[UEFA Europa League]], and one [[UEFA Super Cup]].&lt;ref name="Chelsea win breaks London duck"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea win breaks London duck |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=1798274.html#chelseas+capital+gains |work=Union of European Football Associations |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1449255/ivanovic-goal-wins-europa-league-chelsea?cc=5901 |title=Chelsea wins Europa on Ivanovic header |publisher=ESPNFC |date=16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1947872.html |title=Chelsea join illustrious trio |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Mourinho]] is the club's most successful manager in terms of the number of major honours won, and his title-winning team set an English record for points between 2004 and 2005.{{refn|group=note|Chelsa's record number of points (95) in the 2004–05 season was broken by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (100) in the 2017–18 season.}} Chelsea have traditionally wore a royal blue kit with white socks, and the club's crest features a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff.&lt;ref name="new crest"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea centenary crest unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4008257.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The club have rivalries with neighbouring clubs [[West London derby|Fulham]], [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|Arsenal]], and [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|Tottenham Hotspur]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Chelsea F.C.}}
[[File:Chelsea Team 1905.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[History of Chelsea F.C.|first Chelsea team]] in September 1905]]

In 1904, [[Gus Mears]] acquired the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea|Chelsea]] was chosen for the new club; names like ''Kensington FC'', ''Stamford Bridge FC'' and ''London FC'' were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),&lt;ref name="teamhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/1900.html|title=The Birth of a Club|publisher=Chelsea FC|date=30 September 2004|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.

The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the [[1915 FA Cup Final]], where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1800262 |title=Team History – 1905–29 |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=23 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718071312/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0%2C%2C10268~1800262%2C00.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea attracted large crowds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0,,10268~910883,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720222638/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0%2C%2C10268~910883%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2012 |title=Between the Wars – Big Names and Big Crowds |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a reputation for signing big-name players,&lt;ref name="glanville"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 January 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article992039.ece |title=Little sign of change for Chelsea and their impossible dreams |work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=15 March 2009 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years.

Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and England centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in [[1954–55 Chelsea F.C. season|1954–55]]. The following season saw UEFA create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 April 2005 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/europe/article2327902.ece |title=The great Chelsea surrender |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 December 2006 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach [[Tommy Docherty]].

[[File:ChelseaFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing the progress of Chelsea's league finishes from 1906 to the present]]

Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography – The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years|publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7553-1466-9 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, [[Dave Sexton]], Chelsea won the [[1970 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 1970]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in Athens.

The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.

[[File:Chelsea UCL Winners 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|Chelsea players celebrate their first [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League title]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] (2012).]]

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the [[1994 FA Cup Final]] with [[Glenn Hoddle]]. It was not until the appointment of [[Ruud Gullit]] as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the club [[1997 FA Cup Final|won the FA Cup in 1997]] and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who led the team to victory in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]], the [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] and the [[1998 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] in 1998, the [[2000 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2000]] and their first appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Vialli was sacked in favour of [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the [[2002 FA Cup Final]] and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.

In July 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for £140&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="takeover"/&gt; Over £100&amp;nbsp;million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea sack Ranieri |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3742477.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[José Mourinho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea appoint Mourinho |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3765263.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War ([[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/03/12/SOCCER_Chelsea.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603160253/http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F06%2F03%2F12%2FSOCCER_Chelsea.html&amp;TEAMHD=soccer |archivedate=3 June 2012 |title=Terry Eyes Back-to-Back Titles |work=Sporting Life |accessdate=22 January 2007 |first=Matt |last=Barlow |date=12 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to winning an FA Cup ([[2007 FA Cup Final|2007]]) and two League Cups ([[2005 Football League Cup Final|2005]] and [[2007 Football League Cup Final|2007]]). After a poor start to the 2007–2008 season, Mourinho was replaced by [[Avram Grant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea name Grant as new manager |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7004083.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who led the club to their first [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final]], which they lost on penalties to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

[[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] took over from Grant, but was sacked after 7 months following poor results. [[Guus Hiddink]] then took over the club on an interim basis while continuing to manage the [[Russian national football team]]. Hiddink guided Chelsea to another [[2009 FA Cup Final|FA Cup success]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea 2–1 Everton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8060989.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he left the club to return full-time to the Russian managerial position.

Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the [[London Athletic Club]] as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&amp;nbsp;acre (51,000&amp;nbsp;m²) site.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had also designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.

Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.&lt;ref name="stadium"&gt;{{cite web

In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the [[Fee simple|freehold]] being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt; The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.

When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the [[Ken Bates|Bates]] era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of ''"Chelsea Village"'' or ''"The Village"''.

The Stamford Bridge [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the [[Association football pitch|pitch]], the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===

Chelsea have had four main [[crest (sports)|crests]], which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a [[Chelsea pensioner]], the army veterans who reside at the nearby [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]. This contributed to the club's original "pensioner" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When [[Ted Drake]] became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a [[crosier|staff]]. It was based on elements in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lcc.html#chelsea%20bc
|title=Chelsea Metropolitan Borough Council

|accessdate=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the "lion rampant regardant" taken from the arms of then club president [[William Cadogan, 7th Earl Cadogan|Viscount Chelsea]] and the staff from the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbots of Westminster]], former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.&lt;ref name="crest"/&gt; This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s.

In 1986, with [[Ken Bates]] now owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Kits – Chelsea

The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.&lt;ref name="new crest"/&gt;

Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year.&lt;ref name="change kits"&gt;{{cite web

'''Watford Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], England, that plays in the [[Premier League]], the highest level in the English football league system.  Founded in 1898 by the amalgamation of West Herts and Watford St. Mary's. After finishing the [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15 season]] as Southern League champions under the management of [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]], Watford joined [[the Football League]] in 1920.

==History==

===Early years===
Watford Football Club was formed on the 15th April 1898 by the amalgamation of two strong local clubs, West Herts and Watford St Mary's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/rivalry-the/ |title=The Rivalry |work=The Straw Plaiters |accessdate=22 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Watford Observer of the 7th May 1898 reported -
"When three-parts of the season was gone, there were whispers of the advantages of amalgamation of the two clubs. That the principle was right few disputed, and the question narrowed itself down to a few minor difficulties. It was ascertained that the executive on both sides regarded the suggestion favourably, and joint meetings of the officials were arranged. The proposals took a definite shape, and very soon amalgamation was a thing accomplished. It was decided, however, that each club should finish off its fixtures. Next season the Watford club will play on the Cassio-Road ground, and one of the chief ideas of the amalgamation is to have a second team of sufficient strength to be an attraction while the first string is engaged elsewhere. The details of the amalgamation scheme we have already given in these columns. 
Generally speaking, then, the local football season which has just closed has been a most important one. It has witnessed two steps which have marked fresh epochs - the adoption of professionalism and the amalgamation of West Herts and Watford St. Mary's." 
The amalgamation was approved by the full F.A. committee on the 27th May 1898 as reported by the Lichfield Mercury of the 28th May 1898 "permission was given to Watford St. Mary's and West Herts to take the name of Watford Football Club, the two clubs having amalgamated."

West Herts were previously known as Watford Rovers who were formed in 1881 by Henry Grover, who went on to play for the club as a [[full-back (football)|full back]].&lt;ref name="wfcnotablepeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10400~65917,00.html |title=They shaped the club |accessdate=27 October 2009 |publisher=Watford Football Club |date=29 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170637/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/History/0%2C%2C10400~65917%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j15/&gt; Rovers, originally composed entirely of [[amateur football|amateur players]], held home games at several locations in the [[Watford|town of Watford]].&lt;ref name=j15&gt;Jones 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronology/&gt; The team first competed in the [[FA Cup]] in the [[FA Cup 1886–87|1886–87 season]], and in 1889 Watford won the [[Herts Senior Cup|County Cup]] for the first time. The team became the football section of "West Hertfordshire Club and Ground" in 1891, and consequently moved to a ground on [[Cassio Road]]. As "West Herts" they joined the [[Southern Football League]] in 1896.  West Herts fortunes slumped at the start of the 1897/98 season and attendances were less than 200.  They took the bold step of turning professional and their fortunes revived. Watford St. Mary's were runners up in the Hertfordshire Senior Cup of 1894/95 and attracted crowds of 400 to 500 even when West Herts were at home. The two clubs talked of an amalgamation, which ultimately occurred on 15 April 1898. This was reported by the Watford Observer of the 7th May 1898.  It was agreed that the two clubs should complete their remaining fixtures for the season.  The new club was named Watford Football Club.&lt;ref name=chronology&gt;Jones 1996, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SkillyWilliams.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=The head and shoulders of a man, wearing a hat and coat.|Long-serving [[Skilly Williams]] was Watford's first choice goalkeeper between 1914 and 1926.]]Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager – former England international and First Division top scorer [[John Goodall]]. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910.&lt;ref name=managers/&gt; Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15 season]] under his successor, [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]]. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War – after finishing the [[1919–20 Watford F.C. season|1919–20 season]] runners-up on [[goal average]], the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new [[Football League Third Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1996, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[1921–22 in English football|1921–22]], the third tier of [[The Football League]] consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and also battling to hold on to their league status.&lt;ref name=arsenal&gt;Hodgson, Guy (17 December 1999).

===Post-war era===
[[File:Watford FC League Performance.svg|thumb|250px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Watford in the English football league.]]Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in [[1950–51 in English football|1950–51]] meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denied F.C.: The Football League Election Struggles|first=Dave|last=Twdell|publisher=Yore Publications|year=2001|isbn=978-1-874427-98-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBain returned in 1956,&lt;ref name=managers/&gt; and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the [[1958–59 in English football|1958–59]] season, and Watford were placed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]].

Watford's kit has changed considerably over the course of the club's history. The club's kit featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of black and white was adopted for the 1909–10 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black shorts for 1959–60, the team's nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watford's kits started featuring red, and the gold was changed to yellow. That colour scheme has continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=historicalkits&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Watford/Watford.htm|accessdate=17 October 2009|title=Watford – Historical football kits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watford Rovers played at several grounds in the late 19th century, including [[Cassiobury Park]], Vicarage Meadow and Market Street, [[Watford]]. In 1890, the team moved to a site on Cassio Road, and remained there for 32 years, before moving to Watford's current stadium at nearby [[Vicarage Road]].&lt;ref name=chronology/&gt; The new stadium was initially owned by [[Benskins Brewery]]; the club rented the ground until 2001, when it purchased the freehold outright. However, the club's financial situation worsened following the purchase, and in 2002 Watford sold the ground for £6&amp;nbsp;million in a deal which entitled Watford to buy the stadium back for £7&amp;nbsp;million in future. Watford took up this option in 2004 using a campaign backed and funded by the fans called "Lets buy back the Vic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/516393.Watford_seal_Vicarage_Road_deal/|title=Watford seal Vicarage Road Deal|work=Watford Observer|author=Phillips, Oli|date=6 August 2004|accessdate=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822082325/http://mobile.watfordobserver.co.uk/search/516393.Watford_seal_Vicarage_Road_deal/|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luton rivalry==

Watford fans maintain a rivalry with those of [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].

[[File:Graham Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] took Watford from the Fourth Division to the First, between 1977 and 1982.]]Watford's team was selected by committee until 1903, when former [[England national football team|England]] international [[John Goodall]] was appointed [[player-manager]]. The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 1903–04. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, [[Harry Kent (footballer)|Harry Kent]], who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1991, pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Kent led the club to the Southern League title in [[1914–15 Watford F.C. season|1914–15]], and missed out on a second title in [[1919–20 Watford F.C. season|1919–20]] on [[goal average]], before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors – [[Fred Pagnam]], [[Neil McBain]] and [[Bill Findlay (footballer)|Bill Findlay]] – all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]], although Findlay did lead Watford to a [[Football League Third Division South Cup|Third Division South Cup]] win in 1937.

Up until Findlay's departure in 1947, Watford had been managed by five managers in 44 years, all of whom played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players.&lt;ref name="managers"&gt;Jones 1996, pp. 267–274.&lt;/ref&gt; After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. [[Ron Burgess (footballer)|Ron Burgess]] led Watford to promotion from the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1959–60. [[Bill McGarry]] was only in charge for one full season (1963–64), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor [[Ken Furphy]] matched that achievement in 1966–67, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first [[FA Cup]] semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy's departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers [[George Kirby (footballer)|George Kirby]] and [[Mike Keen]].&lt;ref name="managers" /&gt;

Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the first time in Watford's history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 1983–84, as well as reaching the [[1984 FA Cup final]]. Taylor left the club at the end of 1986–87. Under the six subsequent permanent managers ([[Dave Bassett]], [[Steve Harrison (footballer)|Steve Harrison]], [[Colin Lee]], [[Steve Perryman]], [[Glenn Roeder]] and [[Kenny Jackett]]), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 1997–98 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the [[Premier League]] in [[1999–2000 Watford F.C. season|1999–2000]]. Since Taylor's retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, [[Aidy Boothroyd]] took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/7707054.stm "Boothroyd &amp; Watford part company"]. BBC Sport. 3 November 2008. Retrieved 14 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Watford's takeover by the Pozzo family, [[Gianfranco Zola]] was appointed head coach, replacing former centre back [[Sean Dyche]] in July 2012,.&lt;ref name="managers2" /&gt; Zola took Watford to third position in the Championship in 2012–13 but resigned on 16 December 2013. He was replaced by fellow Italian [[Giuseppe Sannino|Beppe Sannino]] in December 2013. Sannino guided the team to a final league position of 13th.

Despite winning four of the first five league matches of the 2014/15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino's position had become the subject of much speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] the day before.

Sannino's departure initiated a bizarre sequence of events which led to Watford having three further head coaches in little more than a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] head coach [[Óscar García Junyent|Óscar García]] as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Leeds United F.C|Leeds United]] for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. [[Billy McKinlay]], who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11686/9549731/billy-mckinlay-is-still-bemused-after-a-short-spell-at-watford/|title=Bill McKinlay left bemused following his spell at Watford|work=Sky Sports|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] coach [[Slaviša Jokanović]] appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/11522881.COMMENT__Must_be_more_to_Watford_s_disgraceful_treatment_of_McKinlay/?ref=mrs]. Watford Observer, 8 October 2014. Retrieved 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 2015, [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] was announced as the new head coach as the replacement to Jokanović,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/13315768.Flores_is_Hornets__new_boss/]. Watford Observer, 4 June 2015. Retrieved 4 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; who had failed to agree contract terms. Despite going on to lead the newly promoted Watford to a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it was announced on 13 May 2016 that Sánchez Flores would be leaving the club at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnton|first1=Simon|title=Quique Sánchez Flores was no longer the answer to Watford's question|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/quique-sanchez-flores-watford-departure-explained|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sanchez Flores's departure, Walter Mazzarri was announced as Watford's head coach starting on 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/walter-mazzarri-watford-fc-head-coach-premier-league-3121237.aspx "OFFICIAL: Walter Mazzarri Appointed Head Coach At Watford"].

Mazzari's tenure as manager was terminated at the end of the season.
On 27 May 2017 Marco Silva was appointed Head Coach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.watfordfc.com/club/silva-named-hornets-head-coach]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 January 2018, Javi Gracia was appointed as Head Coach following Silva's departure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.watfordfc.com/club/official-gracia-named-hornets-head-coach]&lt;/ref&gt;

Striker [[Luther Blissett]] holds the record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all competitions between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in [[The Football League]] during the same period is also a club record. Blissett holds the corresponding goalscoring records, with 186 career Watford goals, 148 of which were in the league. The records for the most league goals in a season is held by [[Cliff Holton]], having scored 42 goals in the 1959–60 season. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in September 1903.&lt;ref name="wfcrecords"&gt;[https://archive.today/20110718004727/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/History/0,,10400~65910,00.html "Watford FC club records"].

Watford's biggest ever competitive win came in 1900, when the team defeated [[Maidenhead F.C.|Maidenhead]] 11–0 in the Southern League Second Division.&lt;ref name="wfcrecords" /&gt; The team's biggest Football League winning margin is 8–0; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 1982. Both of these matches were at home – Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most recently in the 6–1 win against Leeds United at [[Elland Road]] in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watford's 7–4 victories against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively.&lt;ref name="stattorecords"&gt;Brown, Tony.

'''Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Wolverhampton.ogg|ˌ|w|ʊ|l|v|ər|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|t|ən}}, commonly known as '''Wolves''', is a professional [[association football|football]] club in [[Wolverhampton]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England. Formed as St Luke's F.C. in 1877, they have played at [[Molineux Stadium]] since 1889 and compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football, after winning the [[2017–18 EFL Championship]].

Wolves were one of the founding members of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in [[1888–89 Football League|1888]]. The club spent 33 years in the top flight from 1932 to 1965, their longest continuous period at that level. In the 1950s, they were [[List of English football champions|League champions]] three times ([[1953–54 Football League|1953–54]], [[1957–58 Football League|1957–58]] and [[1958–59 Football League|1958–59]]), under the management of [[Stan Cullis]]. Wolves also finished League runners-up on five occasions, most recently in [[1959–60 Football League|1959–60]].

Wolves have won the [[FA Cup]] four times, most recently in [[1960 FA Cup Final|1960]], and finished runners-up on a further four occasions. The club has also won the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] twice, in [[1974 Football League Cup Final|1974]] and [[1980 Football League Cup Final|1980]].

In 1953, Wolves was one of the first British clubs to install [[floodlight]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/Articles/DidYouKnow26.htm|title=Floodlights|publisher=footballsite.co.uk |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in televised "floodlit friendlies" against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956 before the creation of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/13/wolves-world-champions-honved-molineux-hungary-wembley|title=The night Wolves became 'champions of the world' against Honved|work=[[The Observer]]|date=13 September 2014|first=Nick|last=Miller|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the [[1959–60 European Cup]] and the semi-finals of the [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup]], and were runners-up to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the inaugural [[1972 UEFA Cup Final]].

Wolves' traditional strip consists of gold shirts and black shorts and the club badge one or more [[Wolf|wolves]]. Wolves have long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs, the main one being with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], against whom they contest the [[Black Country derby]], although the two clubs have not met in a League fixture since [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12]], the last season they competed in the same division.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.}}
{{about||a statistical breakdown by season|List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. seasons}}
In the 2000 edition of "The Rough Guide to English Football", the history section on the Wolves page begins: "The very name Wolves thunders from the pages of English football history".&lt;ref name="Rough"&gt;Goldstein, Dan (editor). The Rough Guide to English Football (2000), page 582. Rough Guides Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As with several other clubs, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for example, Wolves had humble beginnings shaped by the twin influences of [[cricket]] and the [[Christian Church|church]]. The club was founded in 1877 as '''St Luke's F.C.''' by John Baynton and [[John Brodie (footballer born 1862)|John Brodie]], two pupils of St Luke's Church School in [[Blakenhall]], who had been presented with a football by their headmaster Harry Barcroft.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthews, Tony |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers: The Complete Record |year=2008 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |isbn=978-1-85983-632-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team played its first-ever game on 13 January 1877 against a reserve side from [[Stafford Road F.C.|Stafford Road]], later merging with the football section of a local cricket club called Blakenhall Wanderers to form '''Wolverhampton Wanderers''' in August 1879.&lt;ref name="Rough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; Having initially played on two different strips of land in the town, they relocated to a more substantial venue on [[Dudley Road]] in 1881, before lifting their first trophy in 1884 when they won the Wrekin Cup, during a season in which they played their first-ever [[FA Cup]] tie.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; Having become professional, the club were nominated to become one of the twelve founder members of the [[Football League]] in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Father of The Football League |publisher=[[The Football League]] |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20130227/the-father-of-the-football-league_2293334_3091039 |date=27 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302121558/http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20130227/the-father-of-the-football-league_2293334_3091039 |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they played the first Football League match ever staged (against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]).&lt;ref name="FL History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |title=History of the Football League |publisher=[[The Football League]] |date=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121005/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1357277%2C00.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ended the inaugural season in third place, as well as reaching their [[1889 FA Cup Final|first FA Cup Final]], losing 0–3 to the first [[Double (association football)#England|"Double"]] winners, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. At the conclusion of the campaign the club relocated for a final time when they moved to [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], then a pleasure park known as the Molineux Grounds.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;

[[File:Wolverhampton wanderers 1893.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wolves' 1893 FA Cup-winning team]]
Wolves lifted the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1893 FA Cup Final|1893]] when they beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 1–0, and made a third [[1896 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final appearance in 1896]]. The club added a second FA Cup Final triumph (a 3–1 win against [[Newcastle United]]) to their 1893 success in [[1908 FA Cup Final|1908]], two years after having dropped into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first time. After struggling during the years either side of the First World War to regain their place in the top division (a period that was punctuated by another [[1921 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final appearance in 1921]]), the club suffered a [[1922–23 Football League#Second Division|further relegation in 1923]], entering the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division (North)]], which they [[1923–24 Football League#Third Division North|won at the first attempt]]. Eight years after returning to the Second Division, Wolves regained their top-flight status as [[1931-32 Football League Second Division|Second Division Champions]] under [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]] after twenty-six years away. With Buckley at the helm the team became established as one of the leading club sides in England in the years leading up to the Second World War, as they finished runners-up in the league twice in succession ([[1937–38 Football League#First Division|1937–38]] &amp; [[1938–39 Football League#First Division|1938–39]]), as well as reaching the [[1939 FA Cup Final|last pre-war FA Cup Final]], in which they suffered a shock defeat to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Cup Final: Today's prospects at Wembley| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=29 April 1939|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story?id=786336&amp;sec=englandopinion&amp;root=englandopinion&amp;cc=5739#|title=FA Cup final upsets|date=14 May 2010|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/stoke-city/8509939/FA-Cup-Final-2011-Seven-Wembley-upsets-to-give-Stoke-City-hope-as-they-start-underdogs-against-Manchester-City.html |title=Seven Wembley upsets to give Stoke City hope as they start underdogs against Manchester City |date=12 May 2011|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1937–38 Football League#First Division|1937–38]] Wolves came within a whisker of winning the club's first English league title: a win in the side's last game away to [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] would have clinched things, but in the event Wolves lost 0–1 and thus ended the campaign one point behind the eventual champions, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Tony (1994).

Breedon Books Publishing Company. {{ISBN|1859830005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the things Major Buckley and his Wolves side attracted a lot of attention for in the last two full seasons prior to the outbreak of the Second World War was Buckley's insistence that his players be injected with monkey gland extract to enhance their stamina and performance, a practice that the Football League elected not to sanction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/monkey-glands |title= Monkey Glands&amp;nbsp;– Major Frank Buckley took Wolves to 1930s prominence with dubious injections |date=1 December 2017|publisher=www.theblizzard.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When league football resumed after the Second World War, Wolves suffered yet another final day failure in the First Division. Just as in 1938, victory in their last match would have won the title but a 2–1 loss to title rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] gave the championship to the Merseysiders instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/2464|title=Billy wins his only League title in 1947|publisher=LFChistory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game had been the last in a Wolves shirt for [[Stan Cullis]], and a year later he became manager of the club. In Cullis's first season in charge, he led Wolves to a first major honour in 41 years as they beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to lift the [[1949 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], and a year later, [[1949–50 Football League#First Division|only goal average prevented Wolves winning the league title]].

The 1950s were by far the most successful period in the club's history.&lt;ref name="Cullis"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1193951.stm |title=Wolves legend Cullis dies |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captained by [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]], Wolves finally claimed the league championship for the first time in [[1953–54 Football League#First Division|1953–54]], overhauling [[Black Country derby|local rivals]] [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] late in the season. Two further titles were soon won in successive years ([[1957–58 Football League#First Division|1957–58]] and [[1958–59 Football League#First Division|1958–59]]), as Wolves vied with [[Manchester United]] to be acknowledged the premier team in English football at that juncture. Wolves were renowned both for the club's domestic success and for the staging of high-profile "floodlit friendlies" against other top club sides from around the world.&lt;ref name="European"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shipley, John |title=Wolves Against the World |year=2003 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-2947-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves had become one of the first club sides in Britain to invest in floodlighting in 1953 at a cost of £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-61-years-ago-today-8280713 |title=When Wolverhampton Wanderers invented European football |publisher=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (£274,000 at 2018 prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inflation.iamkate.com/ |title=Historical UK inflation rates and calculator|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Perhaps [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. v Budapest Honvéd FC|the most famed of these friendlies]] saw Wolves defeat a [[Budapest Honvéd FC|Honvéd]] side including many members of the [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian national team]] that had recently humbled [[England national football team|England]] twice, leading the national media to proclaim Wolves "Champions of the World".&lt;ref name="UEFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=419682.html |title=Hats off to Hanot |date=12 May 2006 |publisher=[[UEFA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the final spur for [[Gabriel Hanot]], the editor of ''[[L'Équipe]]'', to propose [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League history|the creation of the European Cup]] (later rebranded as the [[UEFA Champions League]]).

[[File:Wolverhampton Wanderers FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|Chart of yearly performance of Wolves in the [[English football league system|English Football League]] system.]]
The 1960s began with [[1960 FA Cup Final|a fourth FA Cup victory]] and Wolves almost achieved the [[Double (association football)|first League and FA Cup 'double' of the 20th century]] in English football. They were pipped to the league title by a point on the final day of the season by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Despite that bright start to the decade, the 1960s saw Wolves begin to decline. After finishing as [[1959-60 Football League#First Division|league runners-up in 1959–60]] and a creditable third-place league finish in [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[1960-61 Football League#First Division|'double'-winning season]], the team faded and Cullis himself was sacked after sixteen years in post in September 1964 after a disastrous start to the [[1964-65 Football League First Division|1964–65 season]].&lt;ref name="Cullis"/&gt; Cullis's sacking did not prevent the season ending with relegation and the club's first spell outside the top division in more than 30 years. This lasted only two seasons as Wolves were [[1966–67 Football League#Second Division|promoted in 1967]] as Second Division runners-up.

During the close season in 1967, Wolves played a mini-season in North America as part of the fledgling [[United Soccer Association|United Soccer Association league]] which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Playing as the "[[Los Angeles Wolves]]", they won the Western Division and ultimately the championship by defeating the Eastern Division champions [[Washington Whips]] in a final decider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolvesheroes.com/2009/05/04/usa-1967/ |title=USA, 1967: Life in the Fast Lane|date=4 May 2009|publisher=Wolves Heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's return to the English top flight in 1967 heralded another period of relative success under [[Bill McGarry]], with [[1970–71 Football League#First Division|a fourth place league finish in 1971]] qualifying Wolves for the newly created [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. En route to [[1972 UEFA Cup Final|the UEFA Cup final]], they defeated [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencváros]] before losing to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 3–2 on aggregate; a 2–1 home defeat in the first leg proving decisive. Wolves lifted silverware two years later when they won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] for the first time by beating [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 2–1 [[1974 Football League Cup Final|in the final]]. Despite [[1975–76 Football League#First Division|relegation again in 1976]], Wolves bounced back at the first attempt as [[1976–77 Football League#Second Division|Second Division champions]] under manager [[Sammy Chung]], and then under manager [[John Barnwell]], the turn of the decade saw them [[1979–80 Football League#First Division|finish in the top six in the league]] and win the [[1980 Football League Cup Final|1980 League Cup]], when then-record signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]] scored the only goal of the final to defeat the reigning European champions and League Cup holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].

The multi-million pound rebuilding of the Molineux Street Stand in 1979 was to be the catalyst for the club's near-financial ruin during the next decade as difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund it led to receivership and relegation in 1982. The club was "saved" from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player [[Derek Dougan]].&lt;ref name="1982 deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves are saved by last-minute deal| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=31 July 1982|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves 'will have to pay own way'| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=9 August 1982|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought immediate [[1982–83 Football League#Second Division|promotion back to the First Division]] under manager [[Graham Hawkins]], but the Bhattis' failure to invest sufficiently in the club soon saw things unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations through the football divisions under different managers,&lt;ref name="Crisis3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves: What's gone wrong at Molineux?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21589401 |publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being wound-up.&lt;ref name="Crisis1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves in new crisis| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=6 December 1982|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves try to suspend winding-up order| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=30 July 1985|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, with the club again in [[receivership]], a deal saw [[Wolverhampton City Council]] purchase the stadium and surrounding land, while a local developer paid off the club's outstanding debts in return for planning permission to develop the land adjacent to the stadium.&lt;ref name="1986 deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves in the clear| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=6 August 1986|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986–87 season saw Wolves' first-ever campaign in the Fourth Division, where, with the guidance of new manager [[Graham Turner]] and the goals of [[Steve Bull]], who would ultimately score a club record 306 goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-steve-bull-2009-421293.aspx?pageView=full |title=Steve Bull |date=16 January 2009 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054807/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-steve-bull-2009-421293.aspx?pageView=full |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team reached [[1987 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final|the final of the inaugural play-offs]] but were denied promotion by [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]]. Building on that, the team achieved both the [[1987–88 Football League#Fourth Division|Fourth]] and [[1988–89 Football League#Third Division|Third Division]] championships in the next two seasons and won the [[1988 Football League Trophy Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].

[[File:Wolves Football League Championship 2008–09 030509.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Celebrating the Championship title in 2009.]]
Lifelong fan [[Jack Hayward]] purchased the club in 1990 and immediately funded the extensive redevelopment of dilapidated Molineux into a modern all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name="1990 deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayward pledge to restore the greatness of Wolves| newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=11 May 1990|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; With work completed in 1993, Hayward redirected his investment onto the playing side in an attempt to win promotion to the newly formed [[Premier League]]. Despite substantial spending, neither [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] nor [[Mark McGhee]] could fulfil this, both managers leading the team to play-off defeats at the semi-final stages in [[1995 Football League play-offs#First Division|1995]] and [[1997 Football League play-offs#First Division|1997]] respectively. It was not until 2003 that Wolves were promoted, when they defeated [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 3–0 in [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|the play-off final]] under [[Dave Jones (footballer born 1956)|Dave Jones]] to end a 19-year absence from the top level.&lt;ref name="2003 promotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/2938952.stm |title=Hayward's dream come true |date=27 May 2003 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stay proved short-lived as they were immediately relegated back to the newly retitled [[EFL Championship]].

After former England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] failed to bring a swift return, the rebuilding of the squad by [[Mick McCarthy]] rejuvenated the club with an unexpected [[2007 Football League play-offs#Championship|play-off finish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A20554229|title="Merlin" casts magical Molineux spell|date=8 March 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was bought by [[Steve Morgan (businessman)|Steve Morgan]] in 2007&lt;ref name="2007 deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Morgan buys Wolves|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-456671/Morgan-buys-Wolves.html |publisher=Daily Mail|date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later the team returned to the Premier League as [[2008–09 Football League Championship]] title winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7990074.stm |title=Wolves 1–0 QPR|date=18 April 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves successfully battled relegation for two seasons before McCarthy's dismissal in the 2011–12 season,&lt;ref name="BBC 17012933"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17012933 |title=Wolves sack manager Mick McCarthy |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which precipitated relegation under his assistant [[Terry Connor]].&lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Connor appointed to end of season|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17153404|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following relegation, Norwegian [[Ståle Solbakken]] became the club's first overseas manager&lt;ref name="Solbakken"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18030227 |title=Wolves appoint Norwegian Stale Solbakken as new manager |date=11 May 2012|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his tenure lasted only six months before a poor run of results saw him replaced by [[Dean Saunders]] in January 2013.&lt;ref name="Solbakken sacked"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20870241 |title=Wolves sack manager Stale Solbakken after FA Cup exit|date=5 January 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20931554 |title=Dean Saunders: Wolves appoint Doncaster Rovers boss |date=7 January 2013 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders failed to bring any upturn, culminating in both the club's relegation to [[EFL League One]] and his own dismissal.&lt;ref name="Saunders sacked"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dean Saunders sacked after relegation to League One |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22432597 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wolves chairman Steve Morgan says club have failed their city|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22415309|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Kenny Jackett]] was appointed in May 2013 in the retitled position of head coach,&lt;ref name="Jackett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenny Jackett: Wolves name ex-Millwall boss as head coach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22731377|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the team back to the EFL Championship in his first season, setting a new club record points total of 103 which is also an all-time record for the most points accumulated by any team during a Tier 3 season.

On 21 July 2016, it was confirmed that the Chinese investment group [[Fosun International]] had bought the club's parent company, W.W. (1990) Ltd, from [[Steve Morgan (businessman)|Steve Morgan]] and his own company Bridgemere Group, for an undisclosed amount, with [[Jez Moxey]] stepping down from his role as a CEO (he was replaced by [[managing director]] Laurie Dalrymple).&lt;ref name="Fosun Group Takes Over"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fosun Group Takes Over Wolves |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/news-fosun-group-takes-over-wolves-3198807.aspx |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers |date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves bought by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International for £45m |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36852323 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, the new regime announced that Kenny Jackett's contract with the club had been terminated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36929363|title=Kenny Jackett: Wolves sack head coach after three seasons in charge |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Italian international [[Walter Zenga]] was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walter Zenga: Wolves name former Italy international as head coach |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36931955 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenga was sacked after just 14 league games and [[Paul Lambert]] appointed as his successor in November 2016 but, at the conclusion of the season, Lambert too was dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39896630 |title=Paul Lambert: Wolves boss leaves Molineux after seven months in charge |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with former [[FC Porto]] boss [[Nuno Espirito Santo]] replacing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40105588 |title=Nuno Espirito Santo: Wolves appoint former Porto boss as head coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2017, Jeff Shi, one of the executive directors of the club, as well as one of the two directors of W.W.

The club's traditional colours of gold and black allude to [[Wolverhampton City Council|the city council]]'s motto "'''out of darkness cometh light'''" with the two colours representing light and darkness respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1984: Wolves' recurring nightmare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/25/sport.comment2 |publisher=The Guardian|date=25 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the team's original colours upon formation were red and white, adopted from the school colours of St Lukes, for much of their history their home colours have been their distinctive old gold shirts with black shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers |url=http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/wolverhampton-wanderers/ |publisher=The Beautiful History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early decades of the club a variety of shirt designs using these colours were created, including stripes and diagonal halves, until the continual usage of a plain shirt design since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="HistoricalKits"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers – Historical Kits |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Wolverhampton_Wanderers/Wolverhampton_Wanderers.htm |publisher=Historicalkits.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1960s a darker shade of gold was used,&lt;ref&gt;The "old gold" colour was briefly revived during 2000–02.&lt;/ref&gt; known as "[[old gold]]", which is still often cited in the media as the club's colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old gold turns to dross for Wolves |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/19/wolves-terry-connor-relegation |work=The Guardian|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves new boy Doyle cannot wait to slip on an old gold shirt for real |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1198084/Wolves-new-boy-Doyle-wait-slip-old-gold-shirt.html|work=Daily Mail|date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Gold Pennant |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jermaine-pennant-joins-wolves-on-loan-1374561|work=Daily Mirror|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most English teams, their earliest shirts usually only featured a badge on special occasions such as cup finals.&lt;ref name="HistoricalKits"/&gt; The first such badge to be worn on Wolves shirts was the coat of arms of [[Wolverhampton City Council]].&lt;ref name="HistoricalKits"/&gt; In the late 1960s, Wolves introduced their own club badge that appeared on their shirts consisting of a single leaping wolf, which later became three leaping wolves in the mid-1970s. Since 1979 the badge has consisted of a single "wolf head" design; the current badge was last redesigned in 2002.&lt;ref name="HistoricalKits"/&gt;

Wolves' traditional away colours have been all-white, but recent decades have seen a variety of colours used, including black, blue, teal and purple.;&lt;ref name="HistoricalKits"/&gt; The current away kit made by Adidas is all-white with 3 black stripes on the shoulders, the outside of the shorts and top of the socks.

==Stadium==

===Former grounds===
When first founded the club used a field on Goldthorn Hill in the [[Blakenhall]] area as its home, which could accommodate some 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; In 1879 they relocated to John Harper's Field on Lower Villiers Street where they remained for two years before a short move to [[Dudley Road]], with the new ground situated opposite the Fighting Cocks Inn.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; It was here that they played their first ever [[FA Cup]] tie in 1883 and their first ever Football League fixture in September 1888. Although the site could only hold 2,500 spectators at first it was eventually developed to be capable of 10,000.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;

{{Main article|Molineux Stadium}}
{{See also|Sir Jack Hayward Training Ground}}
In the summer of 1889 the club moved to its permanent home ever since, [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], in the [[Whitmore Reans]] area of the city. The stadium name originates from the [[Molineux Hotel|Molineux House]] built in the area by Benjamin Molineux, a local merchant, in the 18th century and whose grounds were later developed to include numerous public leisure facilities. When the Northampton Brewery Company purchased these grounds in 1889, they rented their use to the city's football club, who were seeking to find a home more befitting a Football League member.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; After renovating the site, the first ever official game was staged on 7 September 1889 before a crowd of 4,000.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; The ground was capable of hosting 20,000 spectators, although English football crowds rarely reached that number in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;

Wolves bought the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] in 1923 and soon began a series of ground improvements under the auspices of [[Archibald Leitch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://molineuxstadiumthroughtheages.blogspot.com/p/molineux-archibald-leitch.html|title=Molineux - Archibald Leitch|publisher=molineuxstadiumthroughtheages.blogspot.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the construction of a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side.&lt;ref name="Programme"&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Years of Molineux 1889–1989: Special Souvenir Programme |year=1989 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later; this South Bank was historically the second largest of all [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Kop ends]] in the country and regularly held crowds in excess of 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2011/02/10/launch-of-a-golden-vision-at-molineux/|title=Launch of a golden vision at Molineux|publisher=Express &amp; Star |date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium finally now had four complete stands that would form its basis for the next half-century.

In the days before seating regulations, the ground could hold more than 60,000 spectators, with the record attendance being 61,315 for a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 11 February 1939.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; The 1940s and 1950s saw average attendances for seasons regularly exceed 40,000, coinciding with the club's peak on the field.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; During this time Molineux became one of the first British grounds to install floodlights, enabling it to host a series of midweek friendlies against teams from around the globe.&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt; In the days prior to the formation of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and international club competitions, these games were highly prestigious and gained huge crowds and interest with the [[BBC]] often televising such events.&lt;ref name="European"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football from top to bottom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/football-from-top-to-bottom-994699.html|publisher=The Independent|date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Molineux Street Stand failed to meet new safety legislation, the club began building a new replacement stand behind the existing one on land where housing had been demolished. This new all-seater stand – named the John Ireland Stand after the then-club president – was completed in 1979 and was the first stage of a plan to rebuild the entire stadium.&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt; The cost of the Ireland Stand escalated to over £2 million and plunged the club into a financial crisis. As a result, it was forced to enter receivership in 1982.&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt; By the time the team dropped into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1986, only the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace remained in use. New safety laws were implemented following the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and these forced the closure of both the now-dilapidated North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand. The club did not have the funds necessary to rebuild them.&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt;

Following the takeover of the club by [[Jack Hayward|Sir Jack Hayward]] in 1990, £8.5&amp;nbsp;million of funding was made available to redevelop Molineux comprehensively.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; Between August 1991 and December 1993 three sides of the stadium were completely rebuilt to form a 28,525 capacity all-seater stadium that complied with the [[Taylor Report]]: the Waterloo Road Stand was replaced by the [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] Stand, the North Bank terrace by the [[Stan Cullis]] Stand, and the South Bank terrace by the Sir Jack Hayward Stand (named the Jack Harris Stand until 2015).&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt; Aside from the addition of a temporary seating area in the southwest corner used during Wolves' seasons in the Premier League;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground capacity raised|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~390175,00.html|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=11 June 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902140854/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~390175,00.html|archivedate=2 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this redevelopment formed the stadium for almost twenty years.

In 2010 plans were unveiled of an extensive redevelopment programme to enlarge the capacity and develop the facilities.&lt;ref name="Plans"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolves unveil Molineux redevelopment plans|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2060349,00.html|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=28 May 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630054439/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2060349,00.html |archivedate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of this saw a new two-tier Stan Cullis Stand become fully operational for [[2012–13 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|the 2012–13 season]], raising the current official capacity to 31,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/stan-cullis-stand-official-opening-090812-302651.aspx?pageView=full|title=Stan Cullis Stand official opening|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=24 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605023047/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/stan-cullis-stand-official-opening-090812-302651.aspx?pageView=full|archivedate=5 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed second stage planned to see the rebuilding of the oldest stand at the stadium (built in 1979 and renamed the Steve Bull Stand in 2003) to increase capacity to around 36,000, but this proposal was shelved when it became likely that the club would be relegated from the Premier League in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2581694,00.html |title=Wolves to postpone Steve Bull Stand redevelopment |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122075352/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2581694,00.html |archivedate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club announced in March 2018 that preliminary discussions for the enlargement of the South Bank (the Sir Jack Hayward Stand) had taken place, together with proposals for the Steve Bull Stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2018/03/03/revealed-wolves-plan-for-huge-south-bank/ |title=Revealed: Wolves' plan for huge South Bank|publisher=[[Express &amp; Star]]|date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially thought that the Sir Jack Hayward stand would be rebuilt first, but in February 2019 it was announced that the Steve Bull stand would be rebuilt in 2020, with an increase from 9,500 seats to 11,000, followed by the expansion of the Sir Jack Hayward stand (South Bank) in 2022, a single tier stand is planned, doubling its size to 10,000, this would increase the ground capacity to 46,000. The change of plan appears to be to do with the logistics of housing away fans during construction.

This will leave only the Billy Wright Stand to be developed in the future. Wolves' owners, Fosun, have plans for a final Molineux capacity of between 50,000 and 60,000, but this depends on the club continuing to improve and expand.

===Managerial history===
[[File:StanCullisStatue.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Statue of Stan Cullis outside Molineux.]]
{{Main article|List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. managers}}
Wolves can be identified as having had 27 different (permanently appointed) managers during the club's existence.&lt;ref name="Managers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wolves: Manager history |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=2848&amp;teamTabs=managers|publisher=Soccerbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first manager, [[George Worrall]], was identified by the title of "club secretary", a post that continued until the appointment of a full-time manager in the modern sense was made in 1922.

The club's most successful manager is [[Stan Cullis]], whose 16-year tenure brought all three of Wolves' league championships as well as two FA Cup triumphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stan Cullis |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-stan-cullis-2009-421286.aspx?pageView=full |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=16 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111032/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-stan-cullis-2009-421286.aspx?pageView=full|archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other managers have been inducted into the Club Hall of Fame: [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]] and [[Graham Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall of Fame Inductee Announcement |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hall-of-fame-buckley-and-honved-261012-448288.aspx?pageView=full |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=26 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111746/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hall-of-fame-buckley-and-honved-261012-448288.aspx?pageView=full |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Graham Turner |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-graham-turner-2010-421632.aspx?pageView=full |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=14 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123041925/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/hof-graham-turner-2010-421632.aspx?pageView=full |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner oversaw two successive divisional championship wins in the late-1980s, winning the [[1987-88 Football League#Fourth Division|Fourth Division title in 1987-88]] and the [[1988-89 Football League#Third Division|Third Division title the following season]]. [[Bill McGarry (footballer)|Bill McGarry]] and [[John Barnwell]] both won the [[League Cup]] for Wolves in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Managers"/&gt; 

In the 21st century, [[Dave Jones (footballer born 1956)|Dave Jones]], [[Mick McCarthy]] and [[Nuno Espírito Santo]] have led the club into the [[Premier League]]. [[Kenny Jackett]] took Wolves to a record [[EFL League One]] (Tier 3) points haul of 103 as they won the divisional championship in the [[2013–14 Football League One|2013–14]] season. 

Wolves have been managed by two former [[England national football team|England national team]] managers in [[Graham Taylor]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]].&lt;ref name="Managers"/&gt;

They have a particularly sizeable Scandinavian fanbase, due to the area's television coverage of Midlands football in the 1970s when the club were a regular top-flight team; the first-ever English match shown live in both Sweden and Norway involved Wolves (Wolverhampton Wanderers 1 [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 0, [[Football League First Division]], Saturday [[1969–70 in English football|29 November 1969]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The English Occupation of Sweden; How We Came to Love Your Football| url=http://www.thefightingcock.co.uk/2012/12/the-english-occupation-of-sweden-how-we-came-to-love-your-football/| publisher=thefightingcock.co.uk|date=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugh've Been Framed!| url=http://www.wolvesheroes.com/2009/11/29/hughve-been-framed/|publisher=wolvesheroes.com|date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
{{See also|Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. league record by opponent}}
Wolves' longest-established and strongest rivalry is with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], against whom the club contest the [[Black Country Derby]]. The two clubs, separated by eleven miles, have faced each other 159 times;&lt;ref name="Derby stats"&gt;{{cite web| title=Head to head: Leyton Orient vs. Wolves| url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2744&amp;team2_id=2848| publisher=Soccerbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; their first competitive clash being an [[FA Cup]] tie in 1886.&lt;ref name="Derby stats"/&gt; A national survey by the [[football pools]] found the rivalry to be the strongest in English football.&lt;ref name="Rivalries League"&gt;{{cite web| title=Rivalries League| url=http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/Rivalries_Report_2008.pdf| publisher=The New Football Pools| date=February 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015233159/http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/Rivalries_Report_2008.pdf| archivedate=15 October 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs are founder members of the Football League and the two once contested the league title in [[1953–54 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|1953–54]], with Wolves finishing as champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=When the Black Country rivals Wolves and West Bromwich Albion ruled English football| url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/when-the-black-country-rivals-wolves-and-west-178706| publisher=Birmingham Mail |date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolves also share rivalries with the two Birmingham clubs, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], though they are much farther away than West Bromwich. Wolves have played both Villa and Birmingham numerous times dating back to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Head to head: Wolves v Aston Villa |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&amp;team2_id=154 |publisher=Soccerbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Head to head: Wolves v Birmingham City |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&amp;team2_id=291 |publisher=Soccerbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves' closest geographic rival is actually [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] but, as they have rarely competed at the same level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Head to head: Wolves v Walsall |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=2848&amp;team2_id=2737 |publisher=Soccerbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is of less significance. As Wolverhampton historically sat in [[Staffordshire]], a Staffordshire derby between Wolves and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] was once recognised.

With Wolves gaining promotion from the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to the [[Premier League]] at the end of the 2017–18 season, West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City being relegated from the Premier League the same season, and Aston Villa suffering defeat in the 2017–18 Championship play-off final, Wolves will be the only West Midlands team in the English top flight during the 2018–19 season - the first time that Wolves will be the solo representative of the West Midlands in the top division in 120 seasons stretching back to 1888–89. Wolves’ most 'local' rivals in 2018–19 will be East Midlands side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], who are based 63 miles away from Molineux.

===Fan culture===
During the club's peak in the 1950s, the home crowd's signature song was "The Happy Wanderer". In more recent times, "[[Hi Ho Silver Lining]]" – a 1967 rock song by [[Jeff Beck]] with its chorus modified to ''"Hi Ho Wolverhampton!"'' – has become a staple feature of home games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Football Ground Guide: Molineux| url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/wolverhampton_wanderers/index.htm#Visiting-Molineux| publisher=The Football Ground Guide| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217130801/http://www.footballgroundguide.com/wolverhampton_wanderers/index.htm#Visiting-Molineux| archivedate=17 February 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Liquidator (instrumental)|The Liquidator]]" instrumental by the [[Harry J. Allstars]] was also popularly used in the stadium until a request from the [[West Midlands Police]] to cease due to concerns that the obscene lyrics used by some fans during the chorus&lt;ref&gt;The offending lyrics were "Fuck off West Brom"&lt;/ref&gt; could incite trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Can we play you every week?| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/1680656.stm| publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Wolverhampton Council (Licensing and Environmental Protection Panel) Meeting| url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/15397180-2094-4B5E-871B-CC4725E39132/0/limi210503.pdf| publisher=Wolverhampton Council| date=21 May 2003| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227065704/http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/15397180-2094-4B5E-871B-CC4725E39132/0/limi210503.pdf| archivedate=27 February 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all large city football teams the club attracted a number of hooligans in the 1960s. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a [[hooligan firm]] named "The Subway Army" would often ambush fans in the [[Subway (underpass)|subway]] adjacent to the ground. The group was gradually broken up and virtually ceased to exist due to a large number of arrests – many as part of the police's nationwide "Operation GROWTH" (or "Get Rid of Wolverhampton's Troublesome Hooligans") in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gary Armstrong and Dick Hobbs | editor = Richard Giulianotti, Norman Bonney and Mike Hepworth | title = Football, Violence and Social Identity | year = 1994 | publisher=Routledge | location = London | isbn = 0-415-09838-6 | pages = 196–228 | chapter = Tackled from behind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club invites interaction with its supporters, and held a Fans' Parliament, usually attended by then-CEO [[Jez Moxey]], which invited independently selected candidates to attend meetings at Molineux every two months up to the acquisition of the club by Fosun in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fans' Parliament| url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/fans/fans_parliament/| publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent [[fanzine]] named "A Load of Bull" (ALOB), in part a reference to leading goalscorer [[Steve Bull]], published supporters' views between 1989 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Fanzine Focus – A Load of Bull 1989–2012| url =http://www.junkarchive.co.uk/wordpress/| publisher =Junk Archive blog| date =30 March 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120420014534/http://www.junkarchive.co.uk/wordpress/| archivedate =20 April 2012| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = A Load of Bull: End of an era| url = http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2705979,00.html| publisher = Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C| date = 30 March 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120405174851/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2705979,00.html| archivedate = 5 April 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership and finances==
The club is owned by the Chinese conglomerate group [[Fosun International]], which purchased the parent company of the club, W.W. (1990) Ltd., on 21 July 2016 for a reported £45&amp;nbsp;million from previous owner [[Steve Morgan (businessman)|Steve Morgan]] and his company Bridgemere Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fosun Group takes over Wolves|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/news-fosun-group-takes-over-wolves-3198807.aspx?pageView=full|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves bought by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International for £45m|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36852323|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fosun International acquired "W.W.

Wolves' group parent company, which wholly owns both the "football club company" and the company holding its properties (including its [[Molineux Stadium|stadium]] and [[Sir Jack Hayward Training Ground|training facilities]]), has net assets valued at almost £50&amp;nbsp;million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report and Financial Statements|publisher=W.W.(1990) Limited|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the club's last published accounts (covering the 2016-17 season), Wolves registered a pre-tax loss of £23.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves reveal huge loss in latest accounts|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2018/03/07/wolves-reveal-huge-loss-in-latest-accounts/|publisher=[[Express &amp; Star]]|date=7 March 2018|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous 2015–16 season, the club had achieved a final pre-tax profit of £5.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Accounts"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves publish annual accounts|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/news-wolves-publish-annual-accounts-3598352.aspx|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most football clubs, significant commercial income is generated from shirt sponsorship deals.&lt;ref&gt;Historicalkits.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Past shirt sponsorship deals were as follows: [[Tatung Company|Tatung]] (1982–86), Benjamin Perry (1986), Staw Distribution (1986–88), [[Mander Brothers|Manders Paint &amp; Ink]] (1988–90), [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] (1990–2002), [[Doritos]] (2002–04), Chaucer Consulting (2004–09), [[Sportingbet]] (2009–13), [[What House?]] (2013–15), Silverbug (2015–16) and payday lender [[Dollar Financial Group|The Money Shop]] (2016-18). The club's current affiliation is with international gaming company W88, who signed a two-year sponsorship deal in June 2018 that made W88 the club's main sponsor on the team's return to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.casinoreviews.co.uk/news/sport/w88-becomes-betting-partner-leicester-city-football-club.html|title=W88 Becomes Betting Partner of Leicester City Football Club|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fosun bought Wolves from Steve Morgan, who had taken ownership in August 2007 for a nominal sum of £10 with the proviso that £30&amp;nbsp;million was injected into the club,&lt;ref name="2007 deal"/&gt; ending an almost four-year search for a new buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayward to quit Wolves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/3141952.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan oversaw nine full seasons, but placed the club on the market for new owners in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club statement: Steve Morgan|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-steve-morgan-2716227.aspx|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=28 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930024356/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-steve-morgan-2716227.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan had bought the club from [[Jack Hayward|Sir Jack Hayward]], a lifelong fan of the club, who had himself purchased it in 1990 for £2.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="1990 deal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RichList"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rich List Profiles: Sir Jack Hayward|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/richlist/profiles2011/2011/01/23/38-34-sir-jack-hayward-120million-130m-65233-28031766/ |publisher=Birmingham Post|date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure Sir Jack invested an estimated £50&amp;nbsp;million of his personal wealth to rebuild the club's stadium and fund new players, but the team only achieved one season in the top flight during his 17 years at the helm despite this increased spending power.&lt;ref name="RichList"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayward frees Wolves|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/21/newsstory.wolverhamptonwanderersfootball |work=The Guardian|date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayward's takeover greatly improved the club's financial health, after a turbulent 1980s in which the club twice was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref name="1982 deal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1986 deal"/&gt; In 1982 the club was "saved" from liquidation when it was purchased by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti, as part of their company Allied Properties.&lt;ref name="1982 deal"/&gt; However, their failure to sufficiently invest in the club saw it face several winding-up orders as well as successive relegations through the football divisions.&lt;ref name="Crisis3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis2"/&gt; In 1986 the [[Receivership|official receiver]] was again called in and a deal eventually brokered for [[Wolverhampton City Council]] to purchase [[Molineux Stadium|the club's stadium]] for £1.12&amp;nbsp;million, along with the surrounding land, while a local developer, Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the [[Asda]] supermarket chain, agreed to pay off the club's outstanding debts in return for the building of an Asda superstore on land adjacent to the stadium.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1986 deal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Programme"/&gt;

==Honours==

'''Everton Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|v|ər|t|ən}}) is &lt;!--  [[Comparison of American and British English#Grammar|Comparison of American and British English]]--&gt; a [[association football|football]] club in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], that competes in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of [[Football in England|English football]]. The club have competed in the top division for a [[Football records in England#Top-flight appearances|record 116 seasons]], missing the top division [[List of Everton F.C. seasons|only four times]] (1930–31 and three consecutive seasons starting with 1951–52) since [[The Football League]] was created in 1888. Everton have won 15 major trophies: the [[List of English football champions|League Championship]] nine times ([[List of English football champions#Total titles won|fourth most]] as of 2017–18), the [[FA Cup]] five times ([[List of FA Cup Finals#Results by team|ninth most]]) and the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] once.

Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first League Championship [[1890–91 Everton F.C. season|two seasons later]]. Following four League Championship and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period, until a revival in the 1960s, which saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championships, an FA Cup, and the [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985 European Cup Winners' Cup]]. The club's most recent major trophy was the [[1995 FA Cup Final|1995 FA Cup]].

The club's supporters are known as [[Everton F.C. supporters|Evertonians]]. Everton have a rivalry with neighbours [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the two sides contest the [[Merseyside derby]]. The club has been based at [[Goodison Park]] in [[Walton, Liverpool]], since 1892, after moving from [[Anfield]] following a row over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.

The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club.&lt;ref name=stdomingos/&gt; The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.&lt;ref name=stdomingos&gt;{{cite web |title=Club profile: Everton |publisher=Premier League |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/everton|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/05/10/st-domingos |title=St Domingo's – 53.425799°N, 2.964903°W |publisher=Everton F.C. |date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was a founding member of [[the Football League]] in 1888–89 and won their first [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] title in the [[1890–91 Football League|1890–91 season]]. Everton won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1906 FA Cup Final|1906]] and the League Championship again in [[1914–15 Football League|1914–15]]. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Facts About Football in the First World War|url = http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/9-facts-about-football-in-the-first-world-war|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Facts About Football in the Second World War|url = http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-facts-about-football-in-the-second-world-war|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Everton FC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|300px|Chart showing the progress of Everton F.C. through the [[English football league system]] (1888–2017)]]
It was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed [[Dixie Dean]] from [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]. In [[1927–28 Football League|1927–28]], Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1878 to 1930 |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Everton were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in [[1931–32 Football League|1931–32]], Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/21/joy-of-six-promoted-success-stories |title=The Joy of Six: Newly promoted success stories| author=Scott Murray |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eedd.html |title=English Energy and Nordic Nonsense| author=Karel Stokkermans|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton also won their second FA Cup in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] with a 3–0 win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the final.

The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton were relegated for the second time in [[1950–51 Football League|1950–51]] and did not earn promotion until [[1953–54 Football League|1953–54]], when they finished as runners-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club have been a top-flight presence ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-dixie-years.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113085752/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-dixie-years.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 November 2006 |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1931 to 1960 |publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Everton seasons 1955-2011.png|thumb|Finishing positions in the top flight since 1955]]

Everton's second successful era started when [[Harry Catterick]] was made manager in 1961. In [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]], his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1962/63 Season {{!}} Everton Football Club|url = http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/honours-and-records/championship-wins/196263-season|website = www.evertonfc.com|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1966 FA Cup Final|1966]] the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'A great final&amp;nbsp;– a fantastic comeback'|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30804543|newspaper = BBC|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton again reached the final in [[1968 FA Cup Final|1968]], but this time were unable to overcome [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = West Brom to honour Jeff Astle by wearing replica 1968 FA Cup final kit|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/26/jeff-astle-west-brom-1968-fa-cup-final-replica-kit|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 3 September 2015|first = Press|last = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later in [[1969–70 Football League|1969–70]], Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1969/70 Season {{!}} Everton Football Club|url = http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/honours-and-records/championship-wins/196970-season|website = www.evertonfc.com|accessdate = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1969/70 SEASON|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/1969/70-season.html|publisher=Everton FC|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any [[silverware (sport)|silverware]] for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in [[1974–75 Football League|1974–75]] under manager Billy Bingham, third in [[1977–78 Football League|1977–78]] and fourth the following season under manager [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]]. Lee was sacked in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-school-of-science.html |title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1961 to 1980 |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Kendall]] took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in [[1984 FA Cup Final|1984]] and two League Championships in [[1984–85 Football League|1984–85]] and [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]]. In Europe, the club won its first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985]].&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt; The European success came after first beating [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|University College Dublin]], [[Inter Bratislava]] and [[Fortuna Sittard]]. Then, Everton defeated German giants [[Bayern Munich]] 3–1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club [[Rapid Vienna]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Goodison's greatest night |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/goodison-s-greatest-night.html |accessdate=24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a [[treble (association football)|treble]], but lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup [[1985 FA Cup Final|final]].&lt;ref name="modernhistory" /&gt; The following season, [[1985–86 Football League|1985–86]], Everton were runners-up to neighbours Liverpool in both the League and the [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], but did recapture the League Championship in [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]].

After the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to [[Athletic Bilbao]] after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant [[Colin Harvey (footballer)|Colin Harvey]]. Harvey took Everton to the [[1989 FA Cup Final]], but lost 3–2 after extra time to Liverpool.

Everton were founding members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]], was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player [[Joe Royle]] took over in 1994, the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in its history by defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the [[1995 FA Cup Final|final]]. The cup triumph was also Everton's passport to the Cup Winners' Cup – their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96]] as they climbed to sixth place in the Premiership.&lt;ref name="modernhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|title=The Everton Story&amp;nbsp;– 1981 to 2006
|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain [[Dave Watson]].

Howard Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership.

In [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]] Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996.

Everton reached the semi-finals of both the [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in 2015–16, but were defeated in both.

Everton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added.&lt;ref name=kit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1888-1915.asp |title=Everton history&amp;nbsp;– II: Before World War I (1888–1915) |accessdate=16 November 2007|publisher=Toffeeweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the [[1901–02 in English football|1901–02]] season.&lt;ref name="kit" /&gt; The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]] and [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Everton/Everton.htm|title=Everton|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Historical Football Kits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes. The home goalkeeper attire for the [[2014-15 Everton F.C. season|2014–15]] season was all yellow.

Everton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, black, white, grey and yellow away shirts have been used. The away shirt for the [[2011-12 Everton F.C. season|2011–12]] season was reverted to an amber shirt with navy blue shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2011/05/17/amber-kit-set-to-go-on-sale|title=New Away Kit on Sale|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current away kit is a black shirt with a pink trim, while their third kit is a white shirt with a blue design on the front in the shape of Prince Ruperts Tower.

==Crest==
[[File:Prince Rupert's Tower, Everton FC's Symbol - geograph.org.uk - 72858.jpg|thumb|Since 1938, the local [[Everton Lock-Up]] has featured on Everton's crest]]
At the end of the [[1937–38 in English football|1937–38]] season, Everton secretary [[Theo Kelly]], who later became the club's first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of [[Everton Lock-Up]], which stands in the heart of the [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton district]].&lt;ref name=crest/&gt; The Lock-Up has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a [[village lock-up|bridewell]] to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the [[College of Arms]] in London, Kelly chose to include the [[laurel wreath|laurels]] as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, ''"[[Nil Satis Nisi Optimum]]"'', meaning "Nothing but the best is good enough".&lt;ref name="crest" /&gt; The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the [[1938–39 in English football|1938–39]] season.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Everton crest from official site |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/history-of-the-club-crest.html|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on its shirts. An interwoven "EFC" design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold "EFC" lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.

In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown of Elements|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/breakdown-of-elements|publisher=Everton F.C. Official Website |accessdate=25 May 2013|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=May 2013}} suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer [[Nike, Inc.]] that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-fc-fans-disappointment-modern-4019362 | title=Everton fans' disappointment at 'modern, cleaner' Blues badge | work=Liverpool Echo | date=27 May 2013 | accessdate=27 May 2013 | author=Jones, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Adam |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/yournextevertoncrest |title=Next Crest Revealed |publisher=Everton F.C.

==Nickname==
Everton's most widely recognised nickname "The Toffees" or "The Toffeemen", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton village]], between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a [[toffee]] shop that sold sweets including the [[Humbug (sweet)#Everton mints|Everton Mint]]. It was also located opposite the [[Prince Rupert's Tower|lock up]] which Everton's club crest is based on. The Toffee Lady tradition in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named ''Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House'' in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reasons behind the "toffees" nickname |publisher=Toffeeweb |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#Toffees|accessdate=21 August 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060809052249/http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp| archivedate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, Everton were nicknamed "The Black Watch" after the [[Black Watch|famous army regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Everton history&amp;nbsp;– "The Black Watch" |publisher=Everton F.C. |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since going blue in 1901, Everton have been given the simple nickname "The Blues". Everton's attractive style of play led to [[Steve Bloomer]] calling the team "scientific" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname "The School of Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The School of Science |publisher=Toffeeweb |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809052249/http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp |archivedate=9 August 2006|accessdate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known as "The Dogs of War". When David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton as "The People's Club", which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton are a better buy than Liverpool, says David Moyes |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Everton-are-a-better-buy-than-Liverpool-says-David-Moyes-article418289.html |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2010|first=Simon|last=Mullock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton originally played in the southeast corner of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at [[Anfield]], which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= I: THE EARLY DAYS (1878–88)|publisher=Toffeeweb|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1878-1888.asp|accessdate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groom|first1=Andy|title=The Illustrated Everton Story|date=2014|publisher=Andrews UK Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Groom"/&gt; A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd". Everton left Anfield for a new ground, [[Goodison Park]], where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by [[The Football Association]]. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool F.C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |title=Liverpool Football Club is formed |publisher=Liverpool FC |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907184403/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/timeline/1892-1917/liverpool-football-club-is-formed |archivedate=7 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/goodison/gp-history.asp|title=History of Goodison Park|publisher=Toffeeweb|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. It was also the first English ground to have under soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton firsts |publisher=Everton F.C.|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-firsts.html|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the theme song for ''[[Z-Cars]]'', which is named "[[Theme from Z-Cars|Johnny Todd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'real' story behind Everton's enduring anthem Z-Cars|url = http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-prentice-real-story-behind-7795561|accessdate = 3 September 2015|first = David|last = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a traditional Liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by [[Frank Kidson]] and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny Todd|publisher=feniks.com|url=http://www.feniks.com/skb/music/lull7.html|accessdate=21 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218185904/http://www.feniks.com/skb/music/lull7.html|archivedate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On two separate occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played [[2 Unlimited]]'s song "[[Get Ready For This]]". A month later, the club used a reworking of the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] classic "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]". Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mimms |first=Robert |title=Amateur Dramatics |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/30-Clubs/6382-amateur-dramatics |publisher=When Saturday Comes |date=July 1998 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training facilities===
{{details|Finch Farm}}
From 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at [[Bellefield]] in the [[West Derby]] area of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ghosts-bellefield-part-one-football-3380766 | title=The Ghosts of Bellefield part one: Football history in the making for Everton FC | work=Liverpool Echo | date=22 March 2011 | accessdate=11 March 2015 | author=Prentice, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to the [[Finch Farm]] training complex in [[Halewood]] in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy.

===Proposed new stadia===
There have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000 seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the £30&amp;nbsp;million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/2940481.stm |title=Kings Dock proposal collapse |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 August 2006 |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with [[Liverpool F.C.]] about sharing a proposed stadium on [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton and Liverpool say no to ground share |publisher=icliverpool |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0400evertonfc/0150kingsdock/tm_objectid=15062893%26method=full%26siteid=50061%26headline=both%2dclubs%2dsay%2da%2dfinal%2dno%2dto%2djoint%2dstadium-name_page.html|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own [[Stanley Park Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4164319.stm |title=Merseysiders rule out groundshare |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=17 November 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everton entered into talks with the [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley Council]] and [[Tesco]] in June 2006 over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in [[Kirkby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/5083198.stm |title=Everton in talks on stadium move |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2006 |date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan became known as [[The Kirkby Project]]. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59% to 41%.&lt;ref name = "ground trouble"&gt;{{cite news |title=Grounds for discontent at Everton as move hits trouble |work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/21/everton-goodison-kirkby-inquiry |accessdate=23 August 2010 |date=21 January 2009 |last=Conn |first=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool.&lt;ref name = "ground trouble"/&gt; Following a public inquiry into the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/7546148.stm |title=New Everton stadium faces inquiry |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the central government rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/8379839.stm |title=Government reject Everton's Kirkby stadium plans |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an amended rescue plan with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C. The plan was to assess some suitable sites short listed within the city boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/8379839.stm|title=Government reject Everton's Kirkby stadium plans|accessdate=2 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_5720222,00.html|title=Government dash Toffees plans|accessdate=25 November 2009|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amended plan was also not successful.

The Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10 February 2011 featured a proposal to open the [[Canada Dock Branch|Bootle Branch line]] using "Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic enablers of the project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://councillors.liverpool.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=10728&amp;T=11 |title=Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee meeting on 10.02.2011 |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid transit [[Merseyrail]] line that would circle the city and ease transport access. In September 2014 the club, working with the [[Liverpool City Council]] and [[Liverpool Mutual Homes]], outlined initial plans to build a new stadium in [[Walton Hall Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/15/everton-new-stadium-walton-hall-park-goodison | title=Everton announce plan for new stadium in nearby Walton Hall Park | work=The Guardian | date=15 September 2014 | accessdate=16 September 2014 | author=Tallentire, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those plans were later scrapped in May 2016 with the prospect of two new sites being identified for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-mayor-says-everton-new-11337859 |title=Liverpool Mayor says Everton will have new stadium 'within three years' | work=Liverpool Echo | date=16 May 2016 | accessdate=19 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, the chairman, Bill Kenwright revealed that [[Bramley-Moore Dock]] was the preferred site for the new stadium, with a new railway station and a new road being funded by the City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Everton have a large fanbase, with the eighth highest average attendance in the Premier League in the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=English Premier League&amp;nbsp;– Attendance&amp;nbsp;– 2009/2010|publisher=ESPN |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance?league=eng.1&amp;year=2009&amp;cc=5739|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the [[North West of England]], primarily [[Merseyside]], Cheshire, [[West Lancashire]] and parts of Western [[Greater Manchester]] along with many fans who travel from [[North Wales]] and Ireland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city.

[[File:Luis Suarez runs at Distin 3.jpg|thumb|[[Merseyside derby]] in 2012, Everton's [[Sylvain Distin]] defending against Liverpool's [[Luis Suárez]]]]
Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for [[North West England]] away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benfica 5&amp;nbsp;– 0 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8318447.stm|accessdate=2 July 2010 | date=22 October 2009 |first=Oliver |last=Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the [[1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]].

Everton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], against whom they contest the [[Merseyside derby]]. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other [[Local derby|derbies]] in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the [[Hillsborough disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/fans/index.php?id=6|title=Merseyside Derby|publisher=footballderbies.com|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the "friendly derby" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both [[Anfield]] and Goodison Park. Recently on the field, matches tend to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|red cards]] than any other fixture in Premier League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Malam |title= Gerrard off as Reds take derby honours |date=26 March 2006 |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/03/26/sfgliv26.xml |accessdate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managers==
{{details|List of Everton F.C. managers}}
The club's current manager, [[Marco Silva]], is the seventeenth permanent holder of the position since it was established in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers|title=Managers {{!}} Everton Football Club|website=www.evertonfc.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been [[Harry Catterick]], who was in charge of the team from 1961–73 for 594 first team matches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers|title=History: Managers|website=www.evertonfc.com|publisher=Everton FC|accessdate=29 September 2015|ref=Managers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is [[Howard Kendall]], who won two [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championships, the [[1984 FA Cup Final|1984 FA Cup]], the [[1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], and three [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]]s.

==Records and statistics==
{{details|List of Everton F.C. records and statistics}}
[[File:NevilleSouthall.jpg|thumb|Goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] made a record 751 first-team appearances for Everton between 1981 and 1997]]
[[Neville Southall]] holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain [[Brian Labone]] comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper [[Ted Sagar]], who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]] by American goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]], who ended the season with 17 clean sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/howard-ends-long-search-for-real-no-1-1682619.html |title=Howard ends long search for real No 1 |first=Jon |last=Culley |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |work=The Independent |date=11 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is [[Dixie Dean]]; the second-highest goalscorer is [[Graeme Sharp]] with 159. Dean still holds the [[English football records|English national record]] of most goals in a season with 60.&lt;ref name=records&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/team_records.sd?teamid=942|title=Everton F.C. records|accessdate=16 November 2007|publisher=Soccerbase|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221111720/http://www.soccerbase.com/team_records.sd?teamid=942|archive-date=21 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the [[cornet]] with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]] were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison.&lt;ref name=records/&gt; Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the [[Iceland]]ic midfielder [[Gylfi Sigurðsson]] for a sum of £45m in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40848343|title=Gylfi Sigurdsson: Everton sign Swansea midfielder for £45m|date=16 August 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of [[Romelu Lukaku]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was for an initial sum of £75m, a record fee between two English clubs and the largest sum Everton have received for a player.

Everton hold the record for the most seasons in England's top tier (Division One/Premier League), at 114 seasons out of 118 as of 2016–17 (the club played in Division 2 in 1930–31 and from 1951–54). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992&amp;nbsp;– the others being [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England's top flight. As of the 2012–13 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonresults.com/avillasumm.htm|title=Everton Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everton's community department==
Everton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-15729296 |title=Everton FC charity's free school approved |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EitC represents the club in the [[European Multisport Club Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/events/2014/documents/eusf-agenda.pdf|title=Monday, 1 December 2014 / Session 6: Multi-sport clubs |publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team was an amalgam of the Toxteth Tigers community youth programme, which started in 1968. The team quickly became one of the most successful in the league by winning the BBL Cup in 2009 and the play-offs in 2010. However, Everton withdrew funding before the 2010–11 season, and the team was re-launched as the Mersey Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Everton Tigers to join BBL ranks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/basketball/6222960.stm |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1997 television film ''[[The Fix (TV film)|The Fix]]'' dramatised the true story of a match fixing scandal in which the club's recent newly signed wing half [[Tony Kay]], played by [[Jason Isaacs]], is implicated in having helped to throw a match between his previous club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The majority of the story is set during Everton's 1962–63 League Championship winning season with then manager [[Harry Catterick]] played by [[Colin Welland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126303/|title=The Fix (TV Movie 1997)|date=31 July 1999|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First shown in 1969, the television movie ''The Golden Vision'', directed by [[Ken Loach]], combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life, following the team, is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings. The film's title character, celebrated forward [[Alex Young (footballer born 1937)|Alex Young]], was one of several who appeared as themselves.&lt;ref name="Golden Vision"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/mar/02/screen-break-kelner-football-golden-vision | title=Loach and Boorman prove that footballers were once real people |work=The Guardian | date=2 March 2009 | accessdate=30 August 2011 | last=Kelner |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 film ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', part of the [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]] franchise, Goodison Park features prominently and serves as the venue of climatic fight scene.  Filming for this had been taken of the stadium and crowd during a match against West Bromwich Albion. Boxer [[Tony Bellew]], an Everton supporter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42249192|title=Liverpool v Everton: Tony Bellew on 'a day of torment and stress'|date=8 December 2017|work=BBC Sport|access-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays Creed's opponent Ricky Conlon and wears the Everton badge on his training gear and shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-club-crest-gets-hollywood-10057827|title=Everton club crest gets Hollywood treatment in new Rocky movie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=15 September 2015|work=liverpoolecho|access-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club have entered the UK pop charts on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s when many clubs released a song to mark their reaching the [[FA Cup Final]]. "The Boys in Blue", released in 1984, peaked at number 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=4115 |title=Everton Football Club |publisher=Chart Stats |date=26 May 1984 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the club scored their biggest hit when "Here We Go" peaked at 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=4338 |title=Everton 1985 |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the club released "Everybody's Cheering the Blues" which reached number 83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=13179 |title=Everton Football Team 1986&amp;nbsp;– Everybody's Cheering The Blues |publisher=Chart Stats |date=17 May 1986 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All Together Now", a reworking of a song by Merseyside band [[The Farm (British band)|The Farm]], was released for the [[1995 FA Cup Final]] and reached number 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=7411 |title=Everton FC |publisher=Chart Stats |date=20 May 1995 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the club next reached the [[2009 FA Cup Final]], the tradition had passed into history and no song was released.

'''West Ham United Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[East London]], England. They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club re-located to the [[London Stadium]] in 2016.

The club was founded in 1895 as [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]] and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. They moved to the [[Boleyn Ground]] in 1904, which remained their home ground for more than a century. The team initially competed in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[Western Football League|Western League]] before joining the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1919. They were promoted to the top flight in 1923, when they were also losing finalists in the first [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. In 1940, the club won the inaugural [[Football League War Cup]].

West Ham have been winners of the [[FA Cup]] three times, in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1964]], [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]], and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]], and have also been runners-up twice, in [[1923 FA Cup Final|1923]], and [[2006 FA Cup Final|2006]]. The club have reached two major European finals, winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1964–65 European Cup Winners' Cup|1965]] and finishing runners-up in the same competition in [[1975–76 European Cup Winners' Cup|1976]]. West Ham also won the [[Intertoto Cup]] in 1999. They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 60 of 92 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the [[2017-18 Premier League|2017–18 season]]. The club's highest league position to date came in [[1985–86 Football League|1985–86]], when they achieved third place in the then [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

Three West Ham players were members of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] final-winning [[England national football team|England]] team: captain [[Bobby Moore]] and goalscorers [[Sir Geoff Hurst|Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]].

===Origins===
{{main article|Thames Ironworks F.C.}}
[[File:ThamesIronworksFC.gif|thumb|right|200px|Earliest club shot, during its founding year as Thames Ironworks in 1895]]
The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as [[Thames Ironworks F.C.]], the [[works team]] of the largest and last surviving shipbuilder on the Thames, [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]], by foreman and local league referee [[Dave Taylor (Thames Ironworks F.C. founder)|Dave Taylor]] and owner [[Arnold Hills]]&lt;ref name=Spartacus1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WHhistory1.htm|title=The History of West Ham United 1895–1896|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was announced in the ''Thames Ironworks Gazette'' of June 1895. Thames Ironworks was based in [[Leamouth|Leamouth Wharf]] in [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Canning Town]] on both banks of the [[River Lea]], where the [[River Lea|Lea]] meets the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Thames Ironworks built many ships and other structures, the most famous being {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}. The last ship built there was the [[dreadnought]] {{HMS|Thunderer|1911|6}} in 1912 and the yard shut soon after.

The repair yard of the [[Union-Castle Line|Castle Shipping Line]] was a very near neighbour and their work team, initially known as the [[Old Castle Swifts F.C.|Castle Swifts]], would informally merge with the Thames Ironworks own team.

The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees. Thomas Freeman was a ships fireman and Walter Parks, a clerk. [[Johnny Stewart (footballer, born 1872)|Johnny Stewart]], [[Walter Tranter]] and [[Jamie Lindsay (footballer, born 1870)|James Lindsay]] were all boilermakers. Other employees included William Chapman, [[George Sage (footballer)|George Sage]] and Fred Chamberlain, as well as apprentice riveter [[Charlie Dove]], who was to have a great influence on the club's future at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=West Ham: A Nostalgic Look at a Century of the Club| publisher=Haynes Publishing| first=Iain| last=Dale| isbn=978-0-857330-45-1| page=10| date=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thames Ironworks won the [[West Ham Charity Cup]], contested by clubs in the [[West Ham]] locality, in 1895, then won the [[London League (football)|London League]] in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt.&lt;ref name="Stats1"&gt;'{{cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/THAMEIRO.HTM | title= Source for Thames Ironworks statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.&lt;ref name="Stats1"/&gt;

The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University "[[University Sporting Blue|Blue]]," but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn through 1897 to 1899.

Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club, in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded, then almost immediately relaunched on 5 July 1900 as West Ham United F.C. with [[Syd King]] as their manager and future manager [[Charlie Paynter]] as his assistant. Because of the original "works team" roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as "the Irons" or "the Hammers" amongst fans and the media.&lt;ref name="EastLon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/thames%20ironworks.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213220605/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/thames%20ironworks.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=13 February 2006 | title=East London History regarding Thames Ironworks | publisher=EastLondonHistory.com | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All%20abstracts.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117001255/http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All%20abstracts.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=17 January 2005 | title=Pg24, citing study into West Hams community ties | publisher=Leeds Metropolitan University | format=PDF | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of West Ham United (1901–1961)===
West Ham Utd joined the Western League for the 1901 season&lt;ref name="Stats2"&gt;'{{cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/W-HAMU.HTM | title=Source for West Ham statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1. In 1907, West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1–0 to become the Western League Overall Champions.&lt;ref name="Stats2"/&gt; The reborn club continued to play their games at the [[Memorial Grounds]] in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a [[Association football pitch|pitch]] in the Upton Park area in the guise of the [[Boleyn Ground]] stadium in 1904. West Ham's first game in their new home was against fierce [[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 3–0 winners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Northcutt| first =John |author2=Roy Shoesmith | title =West Ham United: A Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books | year =1993 | location =Derby | page =198 | id = | isbn =978-1-873626-44-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote on 2 September 1904, "Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning, West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park."

[[File:Whitehorsefinal.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Billie'' the White Horse, saviour of the 1923 [[FA Cup]] Final]]
In 1919, still under King's leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the [[Football League Second Division]], their first game being a 1–1 draw with [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], and were promoted to [[Division One]] in 1923, also making it to the first ever [[FA Cup Final]] to be held at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] stadium. Their opponents were [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. This was also known as the [[White Horse Final]], so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by "Billie," a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by [[Constable|PC]] [[George Scorey]]. The Cup Final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.&lt;ref name="1933semi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=1282&amp;united=18_Mar_1933 | title=Game played on 18 March 1933 | publisher=westhamstats.info | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the club was relegated to Division Two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1932&amp;united=1st_Division_1931-32 | title=1st Division 1931–32 | publisher=westhamstats.info | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long term custodian [[Syd King]] was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=P38foEpwni4C&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=syd+king+sacked+west+ham#v=onepage&amp;q=syd%20king%20sacked%20west%20ham&amp;f=false | title=The Manager: The absurd ascent of the most important man in football | publisher=Hachette Digital | accessdate=5 October 2013 | author=Ronay, Barney| isbn=9780748117703 | date=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced with his assistant manager [[Charlie Paynter]], who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player [[Ted Fenton]].

Fenton succeeded in getting the club once again promoted to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player [[Malcolm Allison]], Fenton helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham's approach to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101015/malcolm-allison-1927-2010_2236884_2185790 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025141806/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101015/malcolm-allison-1927-2010_2236884_2185790 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=25 October 2010 | title=Malcolm Allison 1927–2010 | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=15 October 2010 | accessdate=5 October 2013 | author=Helliar, John | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ted Fenton biography|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WHfentonT.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of West ham United|url=http://espnfc.com/feature/_/id/841093?cc=4716|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tributes pour in for Bond|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120926/tributes-pour-in-for-bond_2236884_2930511|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928030453/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120926/tributes-pour-in-for-bond_2236884_2930511|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2012|publisher=West Ham United|accessdate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glory years (1961–1978)===
[[Ron Greenwood]] was appointed as Fenton's successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies, winning the [[FA Cup]] in 1964. The team was led by the young [[Bobby Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/2582091/1964-FA-Cup-final-colour-picture-special-West-Ham-3-Preston-2.html|title=1964 FA Cup final|work=The Sun|accessdate=4 October 2013|location=London|first=Jim|last=Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also won the [[1965 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-managers-how-roy-hodgsons-predecessors-fared-7703923.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4 | title=England managers: How Roy Hodgson's predecessors fared | work=The Independent | accessdate=4 October 2013 | location=London | date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/1447218.stm | title=Obituary: Ron Greenwood | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=4 October 2013 | date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], key members of the tournament winners [[England national football team|England]] were West Ham players, including the captain, [[Bobby Moore]]; [[Martin Peters]] (who scored in the final); and [[Geoff Hurst]], who scored the first, and only, [[hat-trick]] in a men's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final.&lt;ref name=rg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100531/world-cup-hammers_2236884_2059863 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603135903/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100531/world-cup-hammers_2236884_2059863 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=3 June 2010 | title=World Cup Hammers | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=4 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130222/bonzo-pays-tribute-to-bobby_2236884_3084197 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221506/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130222/bonzo-pays-tribute-to-bobby_2236884_3084197 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=4 October 2013 | title=Bonzo plays tribute | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:champions statue.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Champions statue on Barking Road]]
There is a "Champions" statue in [[Barking Road]], opposite The [[Boleyn Tavern]], commemorating West Ham's "three sons" who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.

They also won the [[FA Cup]] in 1975 by defeating [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] 2–0. The Fulham team had former England [[captain (association football)|captains]] [[Alan Mullery]] and West Ham legend [[Bobby Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hammers nail Fulham|url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham|publisher=The FA|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a difficult start to the 1974–75 season, Greenwood moved himself "upstairs" to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant [[John Lyall]] as team manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4922314.stm | title=Former West Ham boss Lyall dies | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=4 October 2013 | date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games combined and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 2–0 in the 1975 final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120517/hammerabilia-wembley-special_2236884_2774289 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221516/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120517/hammerabilia-wembley-special_2236884_2774289 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=4 October 2013 | title=Hammeralelia Wembley special | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyall then guided West Ham to another [[1976 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]] final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4–2 to Belgian side [[R.S.C.

===Ups and downs (1978–2005)===
In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to Division Two, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to an [[FA Cup Final 1980|FA Cup Final]] win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1980, their last major honour.  They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham 1 Everton 1|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1980-04-18&amp;fromDate=1980-04-17&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=Everton&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1980-04-17-12&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1980-04-17-12-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=2&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=17&amp;date_mm_From=04&amp;date_yyyy_From=1980&amp;date_dd_to_range=18&amp;date_mm_to_range=04&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1980&amp;date_dd_from_precise=17&amp;date_mm_from_precise=04&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1980&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText=|work=The Times|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hammers won 1–0, with a goal scored from a header by [[Trevor Brooking]] in the 13th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When the Hammers shocked Arsenal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8435400.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 October 2013|first=Chris|last=Bevan|date=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since. West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86; a group of players which came to be known as [[The Boys of 86]]. However, they suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall's sacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Welch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/20/guardianobituaries.mainsection1 |title=Obituary John Lyall |work=The Guardian |date= 20 April 2006|accessdate=29 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an ''ex gratia'' payment of £100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as "upsetting" circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Nearly Reached the Sky | publisher=Football World | author=Blowers, Steve | year=2005 | page=18 | isbn=978-0-9548336-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WestHamUtdFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Yearly performance of West Ham since joining the Football League]]

After Lyall, [[Lou Macari]] briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/Person.asp?PersonID=MACARILO | title=Lou Macari | publisher=swindon-town-fc.co.uk | accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was replaced by former player [[Billy Bonds]].&lt;ref name=essential&gt;{{cite book | title=The Essential History of West Ham United | publisher=Headline Book publishing | author=Blows, Kirk | year=2000 | page=193 | isbn=978-0-7472-7036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bonds' first full season, [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]], West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a [[Debenture (sport)|bond scheme]], there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season.&lt;ref name=Protest1&gt;{{cite news|last=Pierson|first=Mark|title=Football: West Ham fear FA censure over pitch invasion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-west-ham-fear-fa-censure-over-pitch-invasion-1285373.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 May 2013|location=London|date=27 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BrownOut&gt;{{cite news|last=May|first=John|title=Who IS Terence Brown?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/2539355.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=3 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TEHOWHU197"&gt;{{cite book| title= The Essential History of West Ham United | pages = 197, 198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storrie&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkby|first=Darren|title=Peter Storrie|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/6630/29/|work=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=30 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524031131/http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/6630/29/|archive-date=24 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93.

With the team in the Premier League, there was a need to rebuild the team. [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] player [[Joey Beauchamp]] was recruited for a fee of £1.2&amp;nbsp;million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldseries.co.uk/sport/oxfordunited/unitednews/8220434.I_was_sold_to_save_United_says_Beauchamp/ |title=I was sold to save United says Beauchamp |publisher=Heraldseries.co.uk |date=22 June 1994 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender [[Adrian Whitbread]] going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coventry-ask-babb-bidders-to-raise-offers-liverpool-made-to-wait-1377205.html|title=Coventry ask Babb bidders to raise offers Liverpool made to wait|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant manager [[Harry Redknapp]] was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] being prepared to offer him a position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.football-england.com/billy_bonds.html | title=Billy Bonds | publisher=football-england.com | accessdate=18 August 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703155116/http://www.football-england.com/billy_bonds.html | archivedate=3 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the West Ham board and their managing director, [[Peter Storrie]], made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club—on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club.&lt;ref name="BMTHOTB146"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bring Me the Head of Trevor Brooking | publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company | author=Blow, Kirk | year=2010 | location=Edinburgh | page=136 | isbn=978-1-84596-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling.&lt;ref name="BMTHOTB146"/&gt; Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation.

Redknapp's time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16&amp;nbsp;million, despite the £18&amp;nbsp;million sale of [[Rio Ferdinand]] to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref name="fees"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/redknapp-blamed-for-west-ham-loss-6353787.html | title=Redknapp blamed for West Ham loss | work=London Evening Standard | date=8 November 2001 | accessdate=14 August 2013 | author=Dyer, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were notably successful, such as the signings of [[Stuart Pearce]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Trevor Sinclair]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Paolo Di Canio]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[John Hartson]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Eyal Berkovic]]&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; and [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref name="wrightwrightwright"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/news/131949.stm | title=Sport: Football: News | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=18 August 2013 | date=13 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as [[Florin Raducioiu]];&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Davor Šuker]], who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Christian Bassila]], who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Titi Camara]]; [[Gary Charles]], whose wages amounted to £4.4&amp;nbsp;million but made only three starts for the club;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Rigobert Song]]; [[Paulo Futre]];&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; and [[Marco Boogers]],&lt;ref name=hr&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1321837.stm | title=Harry Leaves his legacy | publisher=BBC Sport | date=9 May 2001 | accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League.&lt;ref name="Boogers"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport16 | title=The 10 worst foreign signings of all time | journal=The Guardian | date=6 August 2000 | accessdate=18 August 2013 | author=Hills, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1995&amp;united=Premier_League_1994-95 | title=Premier League 1994–95 | publisher=westhamstats.info | accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his third season would also see another relegation battle.

Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as [[Ragnvald Soma]], who cost £800,000 and played only seven league games, Camera and Song.

West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following season's [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] as Liverpool had already qualified for the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Javier Mascherano]].&lt;ref name="West Ham sign Tevez &amp; Mascherano"&gt;{{Cite news| title = West Ham sign Tevez &amp; Mascherano

The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined £5.5 million in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huggins|first1=Trevor|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-westham-fapl/west-ham-given-record-fine-over-transfers-idUKL2744414120070427|title=West Ham given record fine over transfers|publisher=Reuters|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the [[2006–07 Premier League|2006–07 season]].

In the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]], West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table, with [[Freddie Ljungberg]] in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing [[Craig Bellamy]] missed most of the campaign, while [[Kieron Dyer]] was out from August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7257001.stm | title=Injured Bellamy out for six weeks | publisher=BBC Sport | date=21 February 2008 | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/happy-returns-making-a-comeback-from-a-lengthy-layoff-2359159.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=2 | title=Happy returns?

It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.

After a row with the board over the sale of defenders [[Anton Ferdinand]] and [[George McCartney]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7596106.stm | title=Curbishley quits as West Ham boss | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=7 October 2013 | date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor was former Chelsea striker [[Gianfranco Zola]], who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the club's first non-British manager.&lt;ref name="zola1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/11/westham.zola|title=West Ham unveil Zola as new manager|date=11 September 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=12 September 2008  | first=John | last=Ashdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], West Ham finished ninth, a single place improvement.

===Move to London Stadium and recent years (2016–)===
Following Manchester United's win in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League|2016–17 edition]].&lt;ref name="europe201617"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/21-May/Hammers-qualify-for-UEFA-Europa-League | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524190640/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/21-May/Hammers-qualify-for-UEFA-Europa-League | dead-url=yes | archive-date=24 May 2016 | title=Hammers qualify for UEFA Europa League | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=21 May 2016 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the tough [[2016–17 Premier League|first season at the London Stadium]], the team finished 11th, along with having to deal with the departure of star man [[Dimitri Payet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/10887457/west-ham-201617-premier-league-season-review|title=West Ham 2016/17 Premier League season review|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team suffered a poor start to the following season, taking only two wins in their opening 11 games. Following a 4–1 defeat to Liverpool at home and with the team threatened by relegation, Bilić was sacked on 6 November 2017. He was replaced by former Sunderland boss [[David Moyes]] on a contract till the end of the season. The team battled inconsistent form for the rest of the season but managed to avoid relegation and finish 13th. Moyes was not offered a new contract and left the club on the expiration of it on 16 May 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2776278-david-moyes-departs-west-ham-after-expiration-of-his-contract|title=David Moyes Departs West Ham After Expiration of His Contract|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Ham United FC.svg|Crest of West Ham United|200px|thumb|right|Club crest (1998–2016)]]
===Thames Ironworks FC===
The Thames Ironworks Team (1895–1900) used the [[Union Flag]] as its badge.

===Rivet Hammers===
The principal element of the badge is the crossed pair of rivet hammers, tools that were used in the shipbuilding industry. The [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Canning Town]] neighbourhoods surrounding the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] echoed to the sound of hammers; [[steam hammer|steam hammers]], sledge hammers and rivet hammers.&lt;ref&gt;The shipbuilding description that follows comes from Brian Belton's book 'The Thames Ironworks' Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Seven large mechanical steam hammers would punch small holes near the edges of the iron plates which would be joined to build the ships. The plates would be put in place and fixed together with rivets by teams of five, three inside the emerging vessel and two outside.
 
Inside the ship one member of the team would heat the rivets till they were white hot and pass to a second person known as a 'catch-boy' or 'putter-in' who would place the rivet in the hole. The third person was known as the 'holder-on' and he would then smash the rivet home with a sixteen pound sledge hammer and then use his sledgehammer to hold the rivet in place while the men on the other side flattened the other end of the rivet.
 
Outside the ship, exposed to the elements, two men with rivet hammers – one right-handed, one left-handed – would hammer the protruding and still glowing rivet flat, so securing one of the many points necessary to link each of the ship's large plates.

The crossed hammers were also incorporated into the coat of arms of the [[County Borough of West Ham]] and those of its successor, the modern [[London Borough of Newham]].&lt;ref&gt;Archived material from LB of Newham website, description of each element of the coat of arms https://web.archive.org/web/20130602073325/http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower===
A yellow or white tower was added, intermittently, from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;website shows much of the evolution of the badge http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/club-crest/4548286338&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for this seems to be to represent ''Anne Boleyn’s Tower'', the most notable feature of [[Green Street House]], an originally Tudor group of buildings which stood next to the [[Boleyn Ground]] until demolished in 1955. [[Green Street House]] was also known as ''Boleyn Castle'' through an association with [[Anne Boleyn]]. The manor was reputedly one of the sites at which [[Henry VIII]] courted his second queen, though there is no documentary evidence to support the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=42741 | title=East Ham: Manors and estates | publisher=University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust | author=Various | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of other factors which may have influenced the inclusion of the stylised castle feature, for instance:
* to reflect the contribution made to the club by players of [[Old Castle Swifts]] 
* The imposing towers, rooves and doorway of the Engineering Department of the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] bore a strong resemblance&lt;ref&gt;link to external image https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/0/02/Im1895EnV80-p567.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; to the castle feature in earlier iterations of the badge.
* The first verse of the club's anthem [[I'm forever blowing bubbles]] begins "I'm dreaming dreams, I'm scheming schemes, I'm building castles high".
* The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] of the [[Tower of London]] as emblematic of [[East London]]. For hundreds of years, up until 1900, inner [[East London]] had been known as the [[Tower division|Tower Division]],&lt;ref&gt;The London Encyclopaedia, 1983, by Weinreb and Hibbert. The Encyclopaedia describes how the creation of the Tower Division, aka Tower Hamlets, made East London a distinct military unit&lt;/ref&gt; an area which owed military service to the [[Tower of London]]. The (originally whitewashed) [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] was used as insignia for the area, for instance on cap badges of local units of the army.
* In recognition of the ‘West Ham Pals’, the 13th Battalion of the [[Essex Regiment]] which was raised in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] in 1915 and saw extensive action and heavy losses on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[World War I]]. The Battalion was formed from volunteers from [[West Ham]] and [[East London]] generally. Their [[battle cry|war cry]] was “Up the Hammers”. The cap badge of the [[Essex Regiment]] was the castle and key of Gibraltar, though the unit made an unsuccessful request to the [[War Office]] that crossed hammers could be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;"Up the Hammers" The West Ham Battalion in the Great War 1914–1918, by Elliot Taylor andBarney Alston.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/hilsdon.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013213249/http://eastlondonhistory.com/hilsdon.htm | archivedate=13 October 2007 | title="Gatling Gun" George Hildson | publisher=Football Lives | author=Colm Kerrigan| isbn=978-0-9530718-0-7| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the club’s reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site.

===Shield===
A shield has been used in many iterations of the club badge, and the shape of the 2016 version matches the cross-section on the hull of [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS Warrior]],&lt;ref&gt;Newham Recorder article on the change of badge http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/heritage/how-a-new-west-ham-united-crest-is-keeping-strong-links-between-the-football-club-and-hms-warrior-1-4346169&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous ship built by the Thames Ironworks. However examining draughtsman's diagrams&lt;ref&gt;Draughtsman's diagram of the hull of the warrior https://d32ptomnhiuevv.cloudfront.net/en-gb/sites/default/files/product_jackets/Haynes-H6106-page-5_0.jpg {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072942/https://d32ptomnhiuevv.cloudfront.net/en-gb/sites/default/files/product_jackets/Haynes-H6106-page-5_0.jpg |date=10 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ship casts doubt on the resemblance between the shield and the ship.

===Iterations===
The crest was redesigned and updated in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform "windows" along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]'s Sleeping Beauty's Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/west-ham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405014018/http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/west-ham|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2010|publisher=premierskills|accessdate=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the club rebuilt the west stand of the [[Boleyn Ground]] (construction finished 2001–02) the "castle" from the redesigned badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers were prominent features of the ground's appearance, both bearing large club badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://www.footballbadgesguide.com/West%20Ham.html|publisher=Footballbadgesguide|accessdate=3 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212837/http://www.footballbadgesguide.com/West%20Ham.html|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new badge was introduced following the end of the [[2015–16 West Ham United F.C. season|2015–16 season]], when the club moved into the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham: Hammers fans vote in favour of new club crest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28261889|accessdate=17 July 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away, leaving just the crossed hammers, which the club says is inspired by the crest before and during the career of [[Bobby Moore]]. The word "London" was introduced below to "establish the club firmly on the international stage", and the more minimalist approach is to give a "strong statement that is instantly West Ham United". The shape of the crest is that of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, the first [[ironclad warship]] in the [[Royal Navy]], which was built by [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We will always be West Ham United|url=http://www.whufc.com/staticFiles/c2/c2/0,,12562~180930,00.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726193724/http://www.whufc.com/staticFiles/c2/c2/0%2C%2C12562~180930%2C00.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 July 2014|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|accessdate=19 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours==
The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] chairman [[Arnold Hills]] being a former student of Oxford University. However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif | title=West Ham kits since inception I | publisher=Various sources, image of kits | author=kitclassics.co.uk | accessdate=15 August 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625144306/http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif| archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/West_Ham_United/West_Ham_United.htm | title=West Ham kits since inception II| publisher=Various sources, images of kits | author=Dave Moor | accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/playing-kit-1900-1999/4547927422| title=Playing Kit: West Ham United 1900 to 1999| last=Marsh| first=Steve| website=theyflysohigh.co.uk| accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story suggests that [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]] right-half [[Charlie Dove]] received the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] kit from William Belton, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Belton had been at a fair in [[Birmingham]], close to [[Villa Park]], the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Belton defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team's kit offered a complete team's "football kits" to Belton in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was "missing."{{sfn|Belton|2006|pages=2–4}} This, however, is often disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Myths and Legends |first=Steve |last=Marsh |work=theyflysohigh.co.uk |accessdate=16 December 2018 |url= http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/myths-and-legends/4593203735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I'm forever blowing bubbles,''&lt;br /&gt;
''pretty bubbles in the air.''|original lyrics to "Bubbles"| from John Helliar&lt;ref name="Bubbles2"/&gt;}}
The team's supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team's anthem, "[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]" introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A [[Pears soap]] commercial featuring the curly haired child in the [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]' "[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]" was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. "Bubbles" Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" whenever any player was having a good game.&lt;ref name="Bubbles1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528221016/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 May 2010|title=The Story of Bubbles|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|author=John Helliar|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as [[Jim Barrett, Sr.|Jim Barrett]]. Through this contrivance of association the club's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.&lt;ref name="Bubbles2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/claret/?page_id=3595 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218021240/http://www.whufc.com/claret/?page_id=3595 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2006 |title=The Story of Bubbles |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |author=John Helliar |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FA Cup Final 1975|1975 FA Cup]] version – which contains the original lyrics, and features vocals from the team's then-current players – is always played before home games, with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line "Fortune's always hiding".&lt;ref name="ifbb"&gt;{{cite web | url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdFnUy0k7Js | title=Blowing Bubbles@Upton park WHUFC-Chelski | via=YouTube | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in [[common time]].&lt;ref name=ifbb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sudhalter-chords.html | title=Lost Chords | work=The New York Times | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Sudhalter, Richard M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other teams, the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as "[[Me And My Girl|The Bells are Ringing]]," along with more [[pun]]-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player [[Paolo Di Canio]]'s name to the [[canzone]] "[[La donna è mobile]]" by [[Giuseppe Verdi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46kADtKInKAC&amp;pg=PA109 | title=Football Delirium | publisher=Karnac Books | year=2007 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Oakley, Chris| isbn=9781780494883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or D.I. Canio to the tune of [[Ottawan]]'s "[[D.I.S.C.O.]]", or the chant of "Who Let The Potts Out?" to the tune of [[Baha Men]]'s "[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]" when [[Steve Potts (footballer)|Steve Potts]] could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or "That's Zamora" to the tune of [[Dean Martin]]'s 1953 "[[That's Amore]]" in honour of former striker [[Bobby Zamora]]. Other former players to be serenaded include [[Christian Dailly]] with vastly-altered lyrics to [[Frankie Valli]]'s "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fanchants.com/football-songs/west_ham-chants/christian-dailly/| title="Oh Christian Dailly" lyrics | publisher=fanchants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Cole]] and [[Carlton Cole]] with [[Spandau Ballet]]'s "[[Gold (Spandau Ballet song)|Gold]]" song title sung as "Cole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/28/sport.arts | title=R Kelly sings the Blues | work=The Guardian | location=London |date=28 November 2005 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=de Lisle, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luděk Mikloško]]. A song for West Ham favourite [[Bobby Moore]], "Viva Bobby Moore", is also sung based on [[The Business (band)|The Business]]'s "[[Oi!]]" rendition of the song, based on [[The Equals]]' 1969 release "Viva Bobby Joe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/bobby-moore-lyrics-the-business.html | title=Bobby Moore Lyrics | publisher=metrolyrics.com | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, supporters adapted the lyrics of [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]" in honour of [[Dimitri Payet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/he-does-flicks-and-tricks-tackles-and-scores-west-hams-dimitri-payet-does-everything|title=He does flicks and tricks, tackles and scores: West Ham's Dimitri Payet 'does everything'|work=The National|date=14 March 2016|first=Andy| last=Mitten|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the players come onto the pitch, and at other times of celebration, as the song ''I'm forever blowing bubbles'' is being sung, around 60 bubble machines produce copious bubbles that rise high into the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;https://meninblazers.com/2017/09/22/bubbles/&lt;/ref&gt;.
Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to [[David Beckham]] in his first away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on [[Diego Simeone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/156542.stm |title=Beckham runs gauntlet at West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=29 August 1998 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in [[South East (London sub region)|South-East London]], the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/07/14/beckham_safety/|title=Beckham still subject of fans' ire | publisher=CNN – Sports Illustrated | date=19 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club, or performed some disservice.

===Hooliganism===
The origins of West Ham's links with [[Football hooliganism|organised football-related violence]] starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The [[Mile End]] Mob (named after an area of the East End of London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casspennant.com/book-aggro.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314024542/http://www.casspennant.com/book-aggro.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=14 March 2010 | title=Want Some Aggro? | publisher=casspennant.com | accessdate=5 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s (the main era for organised football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 1970s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of [[Barking, London|Barking]] and [[Dagenham]].&lt;ref name="CassPennant"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONFESSIONS OF A TERRACE LEGEND The fights, the politics, the rival firms: Cass Pennant, notorious founder member of West Ham's InterCity Firm, recalls hooliganism's heyday.|url=http://www.casspennant.com/news.php?8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314030123/http://www.casspennant.com/news.php?8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 March 2010|publisher=CassPennant|accessdate=7 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter City Firm]] were one of the first "[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]", so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed "football special" charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm's moniker "inter city" suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.&lt;ref name="CassPennant"/&gt;

The 2005 independent film ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'' starring [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Charlie Hunnam]] focuses on a firm of West Ham hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=My guilty pleasure: Green Street |last=Hann |first=Michael |work=The Guardian |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=6 January 2019 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/24/my-guilty-pleasure-green-street}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===

The oldest and fiercest [[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|rivalry]] is with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. The two sides are local rivals, having both formed originally around local companies, with players living in the same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling [[The Football League|Football League]] while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which [[Isle of Dogs]]-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.

The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of [[football hooliganism]]. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the [[2009–10 Football League Cup|2009–10 League Cup]] and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. [[2009 Upton Park riots|Clashes]] between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, including the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8221451.stm |title=Violence erupts at London derby |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 August 2009 | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8443013.stm| title=West Ham fined £115,000 over violence against Millwall| publisher=BBC Sport| date=15 January 2010| accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2016, West Ham were based at the [[Boleyn Ground]], commonly known as Upton Park, in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], East London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35,016,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/page/StadiumInformation/0,,12562,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110235510/http://www.whufc.com/page/StadiumInformation/0%2C%2C12562%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 November 2007 |title=Stadium Information |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=29 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been West Ham's ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]], they played at [[Hermit Road]] in [[Canning Town]] and briefly at [[Browning Road]] in [[East Ham]], before moving to the [[Memorial Grounds]] in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904.

Former chairman [[Eggert Magnússon]] made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government as it was in the borough of Newham.

In February 2010, however, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/7027066/David-Sullivan-admits-West-Ham-buy-out-makes-no-commercial-sense.html |title=David Sullivan admits West Ham buy-out 'makes no commercial sense' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 January 2010 | location=London | first1=Steve | last1=Wilson | accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2010, West Ham and [[Newham London Borough Council]] submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look like you had a track between you and the pitch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100517/olympic-stadium-proposal-submitted_2236884_2053629 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519131459/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100517/olympic-stadium-proposal-submitted_2236884_2053629 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 May 2010 |title=Olympic Stadium proposal submitted |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=18 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/8670638.stm |title=UK Athletics boss Ed Warner boosts West Ham's 2012 plan |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at [[10 Downing Street]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100930/hammers-at-no10_2236884_2170275 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002041608/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100930/hammers-at-no10_2236884_2170275 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 October 2010 |title=Official Olympic Stadium bid. |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 8 October 2010 the world's largest live entertainment company, [[Live Nation]], endorsed the club's Olympic Stadium plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101008/live-nation-back-hammers-bid_2236884_2178677 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010034538/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101008/live-nation-back-hammers-bid_2236884_2178677 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2010 |title=Live Nation back hammers bid. |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=9 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after Live Nation's endorsement, [[UK Athletics]] confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101011/uk-athletics-back-the-hammers_2236884_2180792 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014152958/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101011/uk-athletics-back-the-hammers_2236884_2180792 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 October 2010 |title=UK Athletics back the Hammers |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for "informal discussions" about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014.&lt;ref name=Redevelop&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/west-ham-kicks-off-upton-park-developer-search/5009351.article|title=West Ham kicks off Upton Park developer search

The decision in favour of West Ham's bid was unanimous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12424549 |title=West Ham chosen as preferred Olympic Stadium tenant |publisher=BBC News|date= 11 February 2011|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23922167-spurs-ready-for-legal-battle-as-west-ham-win-olympic-stadium-bid.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212153349/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23922167-spurs-ready-for-legal-battle-as-west-ham-win-olympic-stadium-bid.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 February 2011 |title=Spurs ready for legal battle as West Ham win Olympic stadium bid |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=6 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their [[Brisbane Road|Brisbane Road ground]] could steal support from the club and put them out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13082972 |title=Leyton Orient in 2012 Olympic stadium High Court action |publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/23/tottenham-olympic-stadium-judicial-review |title=Tottenham fail with appeal over West Ham's use of the Olympic Stadium |work=The Guardian |date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]].

On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the [[Westfield London Shopping Centre|Westfield Shopping Centre]] had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2011/06/06/westfield-to-sponsor-west-ham-olympic-stadium |title=Westfield to sponsor West Ham Olympic stadium |work=Construction Enquirer |date= 8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name=Stratford&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham to call 2012 stadium home after Games|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23980097-west-ham-to-call-2012-stadium-home-after-games.do|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=22 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent inquiry into Olympic Stadium decision clears West Ham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/23/inquiry-olympic-stadium-west-ham|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs return to High Court over Olympic Stadium verdict|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/13964363|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs win Olympic review|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/7122003/spurs-win-olympic-review|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012: West Ham Olympic Stadium deal collapses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15251893|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham Hotspur ends 2012 Olympic Stadium legal bid|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15344523|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the original deal collapsed, a new process to select a tenant was begun. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20111011/west-ham-newham-statement_2236884_2478075 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012233754/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20111011/west-ham-newham-statement_2236884_2478075 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=12 October 2011 | title=West Ham&amp;nbsp;– Newham Statement | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=11 October 2011 | accessdate=11 October 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2012, West Ham was one of the four bidders for the Stadium. With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012, Mayor of London Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating that it was "overwhelmingly likely" that the tenants would be West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/16335-west-ham-among-four-formal-bidders-for-london-2012-olympic-stadium|title=West Ham among four formal bidders for London 2012 Olympic Stadium|first=David| last=Gold|work=insidethegames.biz|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borisdecides&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelso|first=Paul|title=London 2012 Olympics: West Ham likely to get Olympic Stadium despite delays, says Boris Johnson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9271826/London-2012-Olympics-West-Ham-likely-to-get-Olympic-Stadium-despite-delays-says-Boris-Johnson.html|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 22 March 2013 that West Ham had signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £1 million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was to move into the stadium prior to the start of the [[2016–17 in English football|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=West Ham get Olympic Stadium after government ups funding|journal=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21889864|first=David| last=Bond|date=22 March 2013|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benge|first1=James|title=Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham fan coalition's call for public inquiry into West Ham Olympic stadium deal rejected by government|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/government-rejects-arsenal-chelsea-and-tottenham-fan-coalitions-bid-for-public-inquiry-into-west-ham-a2926561.html|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Academy of Football==
{{Main article|The Academy of Football}}
[[File:Footballacademy.JPG|200px|right|thumb|"Academy of Football"]]
The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being "[[The Academy of Football]]", with the moniker adorning the ground's new stadium façade. The comment predominantly refers to the club's youth development system which was established by manager [[Ted Fenton]] during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1192517.stm |title=Hammer house of legends |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 February 2001 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the club contributed three players to the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup-winning]] [[England national football team|England]] side of 1966, including club icon [[Bobby Moore]], as well as [[Martin Peters]] and [[Geoff Hurst]] who between them scored all of England's goals in the eventual 4–2 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included [[Trevor Brooking]], [[Alvin Martin]], [[Tony Cottee]] and [[Paul Ince]].

Since the late 1990s, [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Frank Lampard]], [[Joe Cole]], [[Michael Carrick]] and [[Glen Johnson (English footballer)|Glen Johnson]] began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for much bigger clubs. Most recently, the likes of first teamers [[Mark Noble]] and [[James Tomkins (footballer)|James Tomkins]], as well as Welsh international [[Jack Collison]], have emerged through the Academy. Frustratingly for fans and managers alike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418151747/http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 April 2005 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529201217/http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archivedate=29 May 2006 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=29 May 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham, during the 2007–08 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7417746.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=England player numbers at new low | date=27 May 2008 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having "homegrown players."

===Hammer of the Year===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The following is a list of recipients of the 'Hammer of the Year' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whufc.com/club/history/records-and-honours/hammer-of-the-year|title=Awards |publisher=West Ham United F.C.|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first award, to Andy Malcolm in [[1957–58 West Ham United F.C. season|1957–58]], was nominated by a journalist at ''The Stratford Express''. Subsequent recipients would be awarded the title after a vote by supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Andy Malcolm | first = Roger | last = Hillier | website = theyflysohigh.co.uk | accessdate = 21 May 2018 | url = http://theyflysohigh.co.uk/andy-malcolm/4575118372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Brooking was the first player for West Ham United to have been honoured with the title of Hammer of the Year three times in a row in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Scott Parker repeated this feat between 2009–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110516/scott-completes-hoty-hat-trick_2236884_2361310 |title=Scott completes HOTY hat-trick |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521001558/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110516/scott-completes-hoty-hat-trick_2236884_2361310 |archive-date=21 May 2011 |dead-url=yes|access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking has won the award the most times, on five occasions: 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1984. Bobby Moore, Billy Bonds and Julian Dicks have each won it four times.

Bobby Moore has been runner-up four times, while Billy Bonds and Tony Cottee have both been runners-up three times.

Billy Bonds and Trevor Brooking's wins are notable in the amount of time between first and last Hammer of the Year award. Bonds has 16 years separating his wins whilst Brooking has 12.

===Lifetime Achievement Award===
In 2013, West Ham United introduced a new annual award, the West Ham United Lifetime Achievement Award.

The first award was presented to club-record appearance maker [[Billy Bonds]], who picked up the award on the pitch at Upton Park before kick-off against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on the opening day of the [[2013–14 West Ham United F.C. season|2013–14 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130818/bonds-honoured-at-the-boleyn_2236884_3365079 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819102820/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130818/bonds-honoured-at-the-boleyn_2236884_3365079 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=19 August 2013 | title=Bonds Honoured at the Boleyn | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 award was presented to Sir [[Trevor Brooking]], a record five-time winner of the Hammer of the Year award. Brooking received the award before the [[2014–15 West Ham United F.C. season|2014–15 season]] curtain-raiser against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11685/9300736/west-ham-award-for-sir-trevor-brooking | title=West Ham award for Sir Trevor Brooking | publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking had already had the Centenary Stand at the Boleyn ground named after him in 2009.

The 2015 award was awarded to [[Martin Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20150210/hammers-to-honour-peters_2236884_4476925 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216010414/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20150210/hammers-to-honour-peters_2236884_4476925 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=16 February 2015 | title=Hammers to honour Peters | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=25 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2016, it was announced via the club's official website that the fourth recipient of the award would be Sir [[Geoff Hurst]], the club's second all-time leading goalscorer, and scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] Final. Hurst would be honoured at the club's 2015/16 Player Awards Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/3-May/Hurst-to-be-honoured-at-Player-Awards | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604014603/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/3-May/Hurst-to-be-honoured-at-Player-Awards | dead-url=yes | archive-date=4 June 2016 | title=Hurst to be honoured at Player Awards | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Brown (footballer)|Ken Brown]] became the sixth recipient of the award, in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/april/25-april/wonderful-ken-brown-set-receive-lifetime-achievement-award|title='Wonderful' Ken Brown set to receive Lifetime Achievement Award |publisher=West Ham United F.C.|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2019 honour was awarded to [[midfielder]] [[Ronnie Boyce]] who made his debut for West Ham in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/october/22-october/ronnie-boyce-hammers-legend-who-debuted-58-years-ago-today]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leicester City Football Club''' is an English professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Leicester]] in the East Midlands. The club competes in the [[Premier League]], England's top division of football, and plays its home games at the [[King Power Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/kingpowerstadium/|title=Walkers Stadium |year=2004|work=The Stadium Guide website|publisher=The Stadium Guide|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded in 1884 as '''Leicester Fosse F.C.''',&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10274,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621091515/http://www.lcfc.com/page/History/0%2C%2C10274%2C00.html |archivedate=21 June 2009 |title=The History of Leicester City Football Club |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to [[Filbert Street]] in 1891, were elected to [[the Football League]] in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filbertstreet.net/filbert.php3 |title=A History of Filbert Street |publisher=Filbertstreet.net |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929231836/http://www.filbertstreet.net/filbert.php3 |archivedate=29 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renamed the King Power Stadium in 2011.

Leicester won the [[2015–16 Premier League]], their first [[List of English football champions|top-level football championship]]. They are one of only six clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest sporting shock ever, considering at the start of the season they were favourites to face [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/05/03/leicester-citys-football-fairytale-touches-us-all/|title=Leicester City's football fairytale touches us all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple [[bookmaker]]s had never paid out at such long odds for any sport.&lt;ref name="SL upset"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sport's greatest-ever upset|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/article/165/10266888/leicesters-premier-league-triumph-considered-the-greatest-ever-sporting-upset|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=Sporting Life|date=2 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503123546/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/article/165/10266888/leicesters-premier-league-triumph-considered-the-greatest-ever-sporting-upset|archivedate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail odds"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Nick|title=Just what were the odds?

Throughout Leicester's history, they have spent all but one season in the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship).

The club have been [[FA Cup]] finalists four times, in [[1948–49 FA Cup|1948–49]], [[1960–61 FA Cup|1960–61]], [[1962–63 FA Cup|1962–63]] and [[1968–69 FA Cup|1968–69]]. This is a tournament record for the most defeats in the final without having won the competition. Leicester have several promotions to their name, two play-off final wins, and one [[Football League One|League One]] [[List of winners of English Football League One and predecessors|title]]. In [[1971 FA Charity Shield|1971]], they won the [[FA Community Shield]], and in [[2016 FA Community Shield|2016]], they were runners-up. The club have won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] three times in [[1964 Football League Cup Final|1964]], [[1997 Football League Cup Final|1997]] and [[2000 Football League Cup Final|2000]], as well as being runners-up in [[1965 Football League Cup Final|1965]] and [[1999 Football League Cup Final|1999]]. Leicester City have also competed in European football, featuring in the [[1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup]], [[1997–98 UEFA Cup]], [[2000–01 UEFA Cup]], and most recently the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League]], reaching the quarter-finals of the competition in that year.

[[File:LeicFosse1892.jpg|thumb|right|The Leicester Fosse team of 1892]]

===Founding and early years (1884-1949)===
Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston School]] as "Leicester Fosse", the club joined [[The Football Association]] (FA) in 1890.&lt;ref name="OBAF"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sewell|first=Albert|title=Observers Book of Association Football|publisher=Frederick Warne &amp; co. |location=London, England|year=1974|page=58|isbn=978-0-7232-1536-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before moving to [[Filbert Street]] in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] south-east of the city centre and the [[Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Short-sporting-lifetime/story-12030623-detail/story.html|work=Leicester Mercury|title=Short sporting lifetime|date=1 February 2010|accessdate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002163351/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Short-sporting-lifetime/story-12030623-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club also joined the [[Midland League (1889)|Midland League]] in 1891, and were elected to Division Two of the [[Football League]] in 1894 after finishing second. Leicester's first ever Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], with a first League win the following week, against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the club's largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an [[FA Cup]] qualifying game.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; In [[1907–08 in English football|1907–08]] the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the First Division, the highest level of English football. However, the club were relegated after a single season which included the club's record defeat, a 12–0 loss against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=1271|title=Final 1908/1909 English Division 1 (old) Table|publisher=Football DataCo Limited|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, when League football resumed after [[World War I]], Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties of which little is known. The club was reformed as "Leicester City Football Club", particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer [[Arthur Chandler (footballer)|Arthur Chandler]] in the side,&lt;ref name="Soceerbase profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=1527&amp;teamTabs=records |title=All Time Leicester Records &amp; Achievements |publisher=Soccerbase.com |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they won the Division Two title in [[1924–25 in English football|1924–25]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1924-1925/table |title=Leicester City 1924–1925 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto.com |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113855/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1924-1925/table |archivedate=2 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded their second-highest league finish in [[1928–29 in English football|1928–29]] as runners-up by a single point to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref name="OBAF"/&gt; However the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1934-1935/table |title=Leicester City 1934–1935 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto.com |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113859/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1934-1935/table |archivedate=2 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after promotion in [[1936–37 in English football|1936–37]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1936-1937/table |title=Leicester City 1936–1937 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto.com |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113934/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1936-1937/table |archivedate=2 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; another relegation in [[1938–39 in English football|1938–39]] would see them finish the decade in Division Two.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1938-1939/table |title=Leicester City 1938–1939 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto.com |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113825/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1938-1939/table |archivedate=2 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under [[Dave Halliday]] they returned in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1048|title=QosFC: Legends – Dave Halliday|work=qosfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season.&lt;ref name="Soceerbase profile" /&gt; Leicester remained in Division One until 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City drops into second division|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x_BUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sDwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2115%2C3843231|date=20 May 1969|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=Leader-Post|location=Regina|agency=Reuters|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; their longest period ever in the top flight.

Under the management of [[Matt Gillies]] and his assistant [[Bert Johnson (footballer)|Bert Johnson]], Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both [[1961 FA Cup Final|1961]] and [[1963 FA Cup Final|1963]].&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; As they lost to double winners [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1961, they were England's representatives in the [[European Cup Winners' Cup 1961–62|1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup]]. In the [[1963 in association football|1962–63 season]], the club led the First Division during the winter, thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches the club became nicknamed the ''[[1962–63 Leicester City F.C. season|"Ice Kings"]]'' eventually placed fourth, the club's best post-war finish. Gillies guided Leicester to their first piece of silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 4–3 on aggregate to win the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost 3–2 on aggregate to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Gillies and Johnson received praise for their version of the "whirl" and the "switch" system, a system that had previously been used by the Austrian and Hungarian national teams.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=The forgotten story of ...

His successor, [[Frank O'Farrell]] was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in [[1969 FA Cup Final|1969]] for the last time to date, losing to Manchester City 1–0.

No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in [[1973–74 FA Cup|1973–74]].&lt;ref name="The Age 1975-04-05"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kBAQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wpADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5919,1069364&amp;dq=leicester+fa+cup+semi-final|title=Liverpool in 5th Cup Final|date=5 April 1975|work=The Age|page=26 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank McLintock]], a noted player for seven years for Leicester in a successful period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated at the end of the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. [[Jock Wallace]] resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in [[1979–80 in English football#Second Division|1980]].&lt;ref name="New Straights Times 1980-05-08"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kq4TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5450,1043042&amp;dq=leicester+championship|title=Liverpool finally get something|date=8 May 1980|work=New Straights Times|page=30|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, [[Gary Lineker]], emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1962)|Alan Smith]], who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.

Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by David Pleat, who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the Third Division. [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]] was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the football league.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt;

[[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]] took over in 1991 and by the end of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new [[FA Premier League]], but lost to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and a penalty from former Leicester striker [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]]. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 4–3 to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 2–1 in the final.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and his successor [[Mark McGhee]] was unable to save Leicester from finishing second from bottom in the 1994–95 season.

McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995 while Leicester were top of the [[1995–96 Football League#First Division|First Division]] to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers.&lt;ref name="The Independent 1995-12-14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/mcghee-the-new-man-at-molineux-1525726.html|title= McGhee the new man at Molineux |date=14 December 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGhee was replaced by [[Martin O'Neill]].&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; Under O'Neill, Leicester qualified for the [[1996 Football League play-offs]] and beat [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 2–1 in [[1996 Football League First Division play-off Final|the final]] through a 120th minute [[Steve Claridge]] goal to gain promotion to the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]]. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premier League with four successive top ten finishes. O'Neill ended Leicester's 33-year wait for a major trophy, winning the League Cup twice, in [[1996–97 Football League Cup|1997]] and [[1999–2000 Football League Cup|2000]], and Leicester were runners-up in [[1998–99 Football League Cup|1999]]. Thus, the club qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[1997–98 UEFA Cup|1997–98]] and [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|2000–01]], the club's first European competition since 1961. In June 2000, O'Neill left Leicester City to take over as manager of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

===Decline in the early 21st century (2000-2008) ===
O'Neill was replaced by former [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] coach [[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]]. During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to [[Red Star Belgrade]] on 28 September 2000 in the [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/945130.stm |title=Red Star end Leicester dreams |publisher=BBC News |date=28 September 2000 |accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.

Taylor was sacked after a poor start to the [[2001–02 Leicester City F.C. season|2001–02 season]], and his successor [[Dave Bassett]] lasted just six months before being succeeded by his assistant [[Micky Adams]], the change of management being announced just before relegation was confirmed. Leicester won just five league matches all season.

[[File:PrWalkers 5.jpg|thumb|left|The East Stand, [[King Power Stadium]]]]
Leicester moved into the new 32,500-seat [[King Power Stadium|Walkers Stadium]] at the start of the [[2002–03 Leicester City F.C. season|2002–03 season]], ending 111 years at Filbert Street. [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]], the Leicestershire-based [[potato chip|crisp]] manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talkingballs.co.uk/showthread.php/2818-Questions-for-Mr-Davies?p=51973#post51973 |title=Statement by the Foxes Trust on an unofficial forum |publisher=Talkingballs.co.uk |date=24 November 2004 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306154457/http://talkingballs.co.uk/showthread.php/2818-questions-for-mr-davies?p=51973#post51973 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30&amp;nbsp;million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money ([[ITV Digital]], itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the £37&amp;nbsp;million cost of the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2349397.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Leicester City put into administration | date=22 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt; Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled [[EFL Championship|Championship]], previously known as Division One.

When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004, [[Craig Levein]] was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get ''the Foxes'' anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager [[Rob Kelly]] took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="An Indepth History of Leicester City"/&gt;

In October 2006, ex-[[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] chairman [[Milan Mandarić]] was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around £6&amp;nbsp;million, with the current playing squad valued at roughly £4.2&amp;nbsp;million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6355687.stm|title= Mandarić seals Leicester takeover |date=13 February 2007|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and [[Nigel Worthington]] appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007, the club announced former [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] manager [[Martin Allen]] as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allen's relationship with Mandarić became tense and after only four matches, Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandarić announced [[Gary Megson]] as the new manager of the club, citing Megson's "wealth of experience" as a deciding factor in the appointment. However, Megson left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Mandarić placed [[Frank Burrows]] and [[Gerry Taggart]] in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed.
[[File:Nigel and Milan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nigel Pearson|Pearson]] and [[Milan Mandarić|Mandarić]] after winning the [[Football League One]] title.]]
On 22 November, [[Ian Holloway]] was appointed manager, and he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league match in charge, beating [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] 2–0.&lt;ref name="The Independent 2007-11-26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/bristol-city-0-leicester-city-2-flexible-fleming-makes-successful-start-760531.html|title= Bristol City 0 Leicester City 2: 'Hollywood' Holloway makes successful start|last=Nickless|first=Graham|date=26 November 2007|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this success did not last, and Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the [[2007–08 Leicester City F.C. season|2007–08 season]]. Holloway left by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by [[Nigel Pearson]].

===Third tier to Premier League and takeover (2008-2015)===
The [[2008–09 Leicester City F.C. season|2008–09 campaign]] was Leicester's first season outside the top two [[English football league system#Promotion and relegation rules for the top eight levels|levels of English football]], but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16]] Premier League champions – the fastest seven-year rise to the top of the [[English football league system]] apart from [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in [[1961–62 Ipswich Town F.C. season|1962]].&lt;ref name="538 Rise"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roeder|first1=Oliver|title=Leicester City's Stunning Rise, In Two Charts|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/leicester-citys-stunning-rise-in-two-charts/|website=FiveThirtyEight|accessdate=7 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in [[2008–09 Football League One|2008–09]], finishing as champions of [[EFL League One|League One]] after a 2–0 win at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], with two matches in hand. The [[2009–10 Leicester City F.C. season|2009–10 season]] saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the [[EFL Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]] in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that [[Paulo Sousa]] had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8793219.stm|title= Sousa confirmed as new Leicester boss|date=7 July 2010|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, following agreement on a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[duty-free]] retailers the [[King Power|King Power Group]], Mandarić sold the club to Thai-led consortium Asian Football Investments (AFI), fronted by King Power Group's [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8890815.stm|title=Thai consortium eyes deal to buy Leicester for £39m|publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2010|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandarić, an investor in AFI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h96i-flVl-Zh-NQeBOoI1XoTi2tg|title=Thai group buys Leicester City|agency=Agence France-Presse  |date=12 August 2010|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was retained as club chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8908211.stm|title=Thai-based consortium seal Leicester City deal|publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2010|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win out of the first nine league matches, Paulo Sousa was sacked by the club with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9051656.stm|title=Leicester sack Paulo Sousa|publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], who had been approached by the club after the 6–1 loss to then bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract with the club.{{cn|date=November 2018}} On 10 February 2011, [[Vichai Raksriaksorn]], part of the Thai-based Asia Football Investments consortium, was appointed new chairman of the club after Mandarić left in November to take over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9393953.stm|title=Vichai Raksriaksorn named Leicester City chairman|publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2011|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sven-Goran Eriksson leaves his role as Leicester boss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15438896|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead ''the Foxes'' to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] after [[Anthony Knockaert]] missed a late penalty and [[Troy Deeney]] scored right at the end after a swift counterattack from a [[Manuel Almunia]] double save.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City appoint Hull City's Nigel Pearson as boss |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15621888|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 November 2011|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Leicester's march up the league system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, combined with losses by [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], allowed Leicester City to clinch promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton saw Leicester become the champions of the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 Championship]], the seventh time they had been champions of England's second tier.

Leicester started their first season in the Premier League since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league matches, starting with a 2–2 draw on the opening day against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28917059|title=Leicester City 1–1 Arsenal|author=Mike Whalley|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Foxes'' then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2004, with a 0–1 win at Stoke City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29090535|title=Stoke City 0–1 Leicester City|author=Steve Canavan|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history to beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 5–3 at the King Power Stadium after coming back from 3–1 down with 30 minutes left to score four goals. They also made Premier League history by becoming the first team to beat Manchester United from a two-goal deficit since the league's launch in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29196081|title=Leicester City 5–3 Manchester United|author=Aimee Lewis|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2014–15 Leicester City F.C. season|2014–15 season]], a dismal run of form saw the team slip to the bottom of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant ''the Foxes'' finished the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/leicester-city-staying-up-incredible-5708532|title=The incredible run that secured Leicester City's Premier League survival|first=Liam|last=Corless|date=16 May 2015|work=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/sunderland-vs-leicester-city-reaction-foxes-secure-perhaps-the-greatest-escape-in-premier-league-10255964.html |title=Sunderland vs Leicester City reaction: Foxes secure perhaps the greatest escape in Premier League history |date=17 May 2015 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2005]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in [[2013–14 Premier League|2014]]), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.

However, on 30 June 2015, Pearson was sacked, with the club stating, "[T]he working relationship between Nigel and the Board is no longer viable." The sacking was linked to a number of [[public relations]] issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son [[James Pearson (footballer, born 1993)|James]]' role in a "racist sex tape" made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33339566 | title=Nigel Pearson: Leicester boss's sacking linked to son's actions | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 July 2015 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/leicester-city-parts-company-with-nigel-pearson-2515428.aspx|title=Leicester City parts company with Nigel Pearson|publisher=Leicester City FC|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33338638|title=Nigel Pearson: Leicester City sack manager|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester reacted by appointing former Chelsea manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] as their new manager for the new [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 Premier League season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claudio Ranieri: Leicester City appoint ex-Chelsea manager|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33513290|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ranieri, the club made an exceptional start to the season.

Reacting to City winning the Premier League, Executive chairman [[Richard Scudamore]] said:

{{cquote|If this was a once in every 5,000-year event, then we've effectively got another 5,000 years of hope ahead of us.}} A film has been planned of the story, centred on Jamie Vardy.&lt;ref name="Leicester Movie"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hyde|first1=Marina|title=What will Hollywood make of Leicester's spellbinding season?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/04/jamie-vardy-leicester-hollywood-louis-tomlinson-vinnie-jones-premier-league-movie|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Established Premier League side (2016–present)===
Just ahead of the opening match of the [[2016–17 Leicester City F.C. season|2016–17 season]], Ranieri cautioned against excessive hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principal objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/11/claudio-ranieri-more-chance-et-landing-leicester-title|title=Claudio Ranieri: more chance of ET landing than Leicester retaining title|author=Paul MacInnes|work=Guardian newspapers|date=11 August 2016|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view on Leicester's chances were shared by Gary Lineker, who said that [[N'Golo Kanté]], who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37063137|title=Gary Lineker: Leicester City will not win title after N'Golo Kante exit|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester initially struggled in their domestic form during 2016–17, spending much of the first few months in the bottom half of the table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award|coach of the year]] and Leicester [[BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award|team of the year]] at the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37063137|title=Sports Personality 2016: Leicester win Team of the Year, Claudio Ranieri top coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 December 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was sacked due to the club's continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. Gary Lineker called the sacking "very sad" and "inexplicable",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39072867|title=Claudio Ranieri: Leicester manager sacking made Gary Lineker 'shed a tear'|date=24 February 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Manchester United manager [[José Mourinho]] blamed it on "selfish players".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri's sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/gossip|title=Football transfer gossip: Barkley, Vermaelen, Mahrez, Neymar, Sanchez|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the collapse in form of the team and particularly Jamie Vardy during the first 20 matches of the 2016–17 season, [[Alan Shearer]] said Vardy had signed a "bumper new contract", but was no longer doing what brought him success last season, and that the entire club was "no longer doing the basics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/alan-shearer-leicester-city-s-jamie-vardy-has-had-his-head-turned-by-success/story-30093574-detail/story.html|title=Alan Shearer: Leicester City's Jamie Vardy has 'had his head turned by success'|author=DanielJBird|work=Leicester Mercury|date=28 January 2017|accessdate=4 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128120837/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/alan-shearer-leicester-city-s-jamie-vardy-has-had-his-head-turned-by-success/story-30093574-detail/story.html|archivedate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a week after Ranieri was sacked, [[Craig Shakespeare]] took over as caretaker manager, and in his first match in charge, Leicester won 3–1 against fifth-placed Liverpool, with Vardy scoring a brace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39024318|title=Leicester City 3–1 Liverpool|date=27 February 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second match as caretaker, Shakespeare led Leicester to another 3–1 victory, over Hull City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39086672|title=Leicester City 3–1 Hull City|date=4 March 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two impressive results and initiating "the type of positive response that we hoped change would bring", the club's owners then decided Shakespeare would become the club's manager until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/2016-17/craig-shakespeare-lcfc-interim-manager-takes-charge-until-the-end-of-the-season-3619260.aspx|title=Craig Shakespeare Takes Charge of Leicester City Until The end of the Season|publisher=Leicester City F.C.|date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2016–17 campaign was also the first season in 15 years that Leicester qualified for European football. Leicester were placed in [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group G|Group G]] of the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League]], alongside [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] and [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]].

This put an end to Leicester's 2016–17 European campaign, as they finished as Champions League quarter-finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39611647|title=Leicester City 1–1 Atlético Madrid|date=18 April 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss, Leicester remained unbeaten at home in the 2016–17 Champions League campaign.

Commenting on the first match of Leicester's [[2017–18 Leicester City F.C. season|2017–18 season]], a close-fought 4–3 loss to Arsenal, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that Vardy was extremely well-suited to the current Leicester team – the "embodiment of pure Leicester-ism" – but a much more difficult fit for other teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/14/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-opening-weekends-action|title=Premier League: 10 talking points from the opening weekend's action:Outstanding Vardy embodies Leicester-ism|work=Guardian newspapers|date=14 August 2017|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare was sacked in October 2017 after four months officially in charge, with Leicester in 18th place in the table.

[[Claude Puel]] was appointed as Leicester's new manager on 25 October 2017. By Christmas, Leicester were in 8th position in the Premier League and went on to finish one place lower in 9th at the end of the season. Despite rumors that Puel would leave, he remained at the club and from the first seven games in the [[2018–19 Premier League]] season, Puel's Leicester had accumulated 12 points, the same points tally after seven games as the [[2015–16 Premier League]] title winning campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/claude-puels-evolution-full-display-2059575&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team suffered a poor run of games which saw Leicester suffer 4 successive home defeats, and following a 4-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, Puel was sacked on 24 February 2019 with the club in 12th place.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lcfc.com/news/1062948/claude-puel-leaves-leicester-city/press-release&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on 26 February 2019, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] manager [[Brendan Rodgers]], who nearly won the Premier League title with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], was appointed as his replacement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47368712|title=Brendan Rodgers: Leicester City appoint former Celtic boss as manager|date=26 February 2019|accessdate=26 February 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts, and either white or royal blue socks have been used for the team's kits throughout most of its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Leicester_City/Leicester_City.htm|title=Leicester City|publisher=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of [[Ind Coope]] in 1983. British snack food manufacturer [[Walkers Crisps]] held a long association with the club, sponsoring them from 1987 to 2001.

The club have three main nicknames – The Foxes, The Blues and City. "The Foxes" is the most common nickname for the club, whereas "The Blues" and "City" are more local terms, usually used by supporters. Other names include "The Filberts" and "The Fossils".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Where Did Leicester City Get Their Nickname From? | first = Sam | last = Fletcher | work = ThoughtCo. | date = 30 April 2017 | accessdate = 8 June 2018 | url = https://www.thoughtco.com/leicester-city-called-the-foxes-3896512}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of a [[fox]] was first incorporated into the club crest in 1948, as Leicestershire is known for foxes and fox hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/180712-city-shirts-a-potted-history-248065.aspx |title=City Shirts – A Potted History | first=John | last=Hutchinson |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=18 July 2012|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the nickname "The Foxes".

The club mascot is a character called "Filbert Fox". There are also secondary characters "Vickie Vixen" and "Cousin Dennis." Since 1992, the club's badge has featured a fox's head overlaid onto a Cinquefoil; the Cinquefoil is similar to the one used on the [[Leicester#Coat of arms|coat of arms of Leicester]]. Prior to 1992, the club's badge had a range of designs. In the [[2009–10 Leicester City F.C. season|2009–10 season]], the club's 125th anniversary year, the home kit featured no sponsor and a new central crest with "125 Years" written beneath it.&lt;ref name="Leicester Mercury 2009-04-25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-unveil-new-home-kit/story-12036491-detail/story.html|title=Leicester City unveil new home kit|date=25 April 2009|work=Leicester Mercury|accessdate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714213122/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-unveil-new-home-kit/story-12036491-detail/story.html|archivedate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the [[Post horn#The Post Horn Galop|Post Horn Galop]] prior to home matches.&lt;ref&gt;Official History DVD, 00:32:00&lt;/ref&gt; It was played over the PA system as the teams came out of the tunnel at all home games. The club since replaced it with a modern version, which is now played as teams emerge for the second half. For the first half, the post horn has been played live on pitch by Paul Hing since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Rousing-tune-leads-way-City-victory/story-28948744-detail/story.html |title=Rousing tune leads way for City victory |newspaper=[[Leicester Mercury]] |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=4 May 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Foxes Never Quit" is the club's motto, which is placed above the tunnel entrance as the teams head out onto the pitch.

On 8 July 2016, the club launched their new third away kit for the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season. It featured in their [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League]] campaign, and was also in use for Leicester's debut match in the competition. The design took inspiration from the 1983–84 kit, boasting a clean white design with thin blue pinstripes on the shirt and a textured form stripe design across both the shirt and shorts.

==Stadium==
{{See also|King Power Stadium|Filbert Street}}
In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the [[Football League]]. When first starting out they played on a field by the Fosse Road,&lt;ref name="Inglis"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=The Football Grounds of Great Britain (2nd ed.) |publisher=Collins Willow |location=London |year=1987 |isbn = 0-00-218249-1|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]], and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane.&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt; After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of ground by [[Filbert Street]], and moved there in 1891.&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt;

[[File:Double Decker Stand at Filbert Street.jpg|thumb|left|The "Double Decker" Stand at [[Filbert Street]]]]
Some improvements by noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]] occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two tier stand was built,&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt; named the Double Decker, a name it would keep till the ground's closure in 2002. The ground wasn't developed any further, apart from compulsory seating being added, till 1993 when work began on the new Carling Stand. The stand was impressive while the rest of the ground was untouched since at least the 1920s; this led manager [[Martin O'Neill]] to say he used to "lead new signings out backwards" so they only saw the Carling Stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/095235361X |title=Author notes on '&amp;#39;Farewell to Filbert Street'&amp;#39; |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002 to a new 32,500 all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport 2002-07-23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2146706.stm|title=Lineker unveils new Foxes home|date=23 July 2002|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was originally named The [[Walkers Stadium]] in a deal with food manufacturers [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]], whose brand logo can still be found in some areas around the outside of the stadium.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 2002-04-10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/apr/10/newsstory.sport1|title=Fans force Foxes stadium change|date=10 April 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first match hosted at Walkers was a 1–1 friendly draw against [[Athletic Bilbao]], with Bilbao's [[Tiko (footballer)|Tiko]] being the first scorer at the stadium and [[Jordan Stewart (footballer, born 1982)|Jordan Stewart]] being the first Leicester player to score.&lt;ref name="El Dia 2002-08-05"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldia.es/2002-08-05/jornada/jornada15.htm|title=Empate del Athletic Bilbao|date=5 August 2002|work=El Dia|language=Spanish|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford.&lt;ref name="The Independent 2002-08-11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1708638.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108172404/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1708638.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 November 2013|title=Leicester make a tidy profit from Deane double|last=Leach|first=Conrad|date=11 August 2002|work=The Independent |accessdate=31 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has since hosted an [[England national football team|England]] international against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]], which finished 2–1 to England, as well as internationals between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], and Jamaica and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. The stadium has been used to host the [[Heineken Cup]] European Rugby semi-finals for the [[Leicester Tigers]] rugby club, itself based within a mile of the King Power Stadium.
[[File:King Power Stadium.JPG|thumbnail|right|The King Power Stadium, formerly known as the Walker's Stadium, has been Leicester's home ground since 2002]]
On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners [[King Power]] wanted to rename the stadium The [[King Power Stadium]], and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/CHANGE-WALKERS-STADIUM/story-12075059-detail/story.html|title=Leicester City's Walkers Stadium could be renamed and increased in size|work=Leicester Mercury|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=19 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002171927/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/CHANGE-WALKERS-STADIUM/story-12075059-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium would now be known as the King Power Stadium. In 2015, vice-chairman [[Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha]] stated plans were in place to increase the capacity of the stadium to around 42,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-increase-capacity-King-Power/story-26656839-detail/story.html|title=Leicester City could increase capacity at the King Power Stadium to 42,000|work=Leicester Mercury|date=8 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102235844/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-increase-capacity-King-Power/story-26656839-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relocation to a bigger stadium has also been considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/leicester-city-look-ground-expansion-build-new/story-29238169-detail/story.html|title=Leicester City look at King Power stadium expansion – or may even build new ground|work=Leicester Mercury|date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, it was announced that initial planning for the expansion and development of the King Power Stadium is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.lcfc.com/news/657242/vice-chairman-confirms-king-power-stadium-expansion-ambitions/press-release| title=Vice Chairman Confirms King Power Stadium Expansion Ambitions| date=10 April 2018| publisher=Leicester City F.C.|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King Power Stadium has also honoured past greats of the club, by naming suites and lounges inside the stadium after the club's former players [[Gordon Banks]], [[Adam Black (footballer, born 1898)|Adam Black]], [[Arthur Chandler (footballer)|Arthur Chandler]], [[Gary Lineker]], [[Arthur Rowley]], [[Sep Smith]], [[Keith Weller]] and former manager [[Jimmy Bloomfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Power Stadium – Function Suites|url=http://www.lcfcevents.co.uk/downloads/LCFC%20CE%20Insert%20-%20Room%20Plans.pdf#page=2|publisher=Leicester City Football Club Conference &amp; Events – Room Plans|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Fair Play Rules Breach==
Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha invested more than £140m over 14/15 to 16/17, including more than £40 million in the clubs's Premiership winning season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranking the Premier League clubs' spending |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/04/25/ranking-premier-league-clubs-spending-past-three-seasons/leicester/|publisher=Daily Telegraph Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the club paid £3.1m to settle the English Football League’s claim that the club breached financial fair play rules when they made a £21m loss (£12m over the guidelines) in their Championship winning 2013-14 season. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leicester make £3.1m settlement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/21/leicester-settlement-football-league-ffp|publisher=Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rival clubs==
{{main|Leicester City F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|Derby County F.C. and Leicester City F.C. rivalry|M69 derby}}

Some Leicester fans consider [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] to be their main rivals. The club's other rivals are [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. An East Midlands Derby is any match involving two of these three clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020074918/http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |title=Club Rivalries Uncovered |publisher= Football Fans Census|date=December 2003 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester also have a rivalry with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], 24&amp;nbsp;miles away.

==Managerial history==
{{Main|List of Leicester City F.C. managers}}
Up until [[Peter Hodge]] was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection and tactics. Though Hodge was originally also titled "secretary/manager" he has retrospectively been named as the club's first official "manager".&lt;ref name="OFAF"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dave Smith &amp; Paul Taylor|title=Of Fossils and Foxes|year=2010|isbn=1-905411-94-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester have had a total of nine permanent secretary/managers and 36 permanent managers (not including caretakers). [[Nigel Pearson]] and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge of the club. [[Dave Bassett]] also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0,,10274~1035220,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218091401/http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0%2C%2C10274~1035220%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2012 |title=Past Managers |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records and statistics==
{{Main|List of Leicester City F.C. records and statistics}}
[[Graham Cross]] holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 599 games between 1960–1976, although [[Adam Black (footballer, born 1898)|Adam Black]] holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920–1935.&lt;ref name="Most Appearances"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0,,10274~1028896,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722013638/http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0%2C%2C10274~1028896%2C00.html |archivedate=22 July 2012 |title=Most Appearances |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Striker [[Arthur Chandler (footballer)|Arthur Chandler]] is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season.&lt;ref name="OBAF"/&gt; The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by [[Arthur Rowley]], in the 1956–57 season.&lt;ref name="OBAF"/&gt; The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by [[Matty Fryatt]], when he netted after just nine seconds against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in April 2006.&lt;ref name="Miscellaneous Records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0,,10274~1028984,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330135817/http://www.lcfc.com/page/Records/0%2C%2C10274~1028984%2C00.html |archivedate=30 March 2009 |title=Miscellaneous Records |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamie Vardy]] broke the Premier League record for scoring 13 goals in 11 consecutive league games, in the 2015–16 Premier League season. Vardy is also the ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1984–85 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester's highest Premier League scorer in a single season.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/champions-citys-record-breaking-season-3093033.aspx|title=CHAMPIONS: City's Record-Breaking Season|date=4 May 2016 |publisher=Leicester City F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record transfer fee paid by Leicester for a player was around £29&amp;nbsp;million for [[Sporting CP]] striker [[Islam Slimani]]. The highest transfer fee received for a Leicester player was approximately £60&amp;nbsp;million from Manchester City for midfielder [[Riyad Mahrez]].

The club's record attendance is 47,298 against Tottenham Hotspur at [[Filbert Street]], in a fifth round [[FA Cup]] clash in 1928. The highest league record at their current home, the [[King Power Stadium]], was 32,242 for a competitive match against Sunderland on 8 August 2015. The highest ever attendance for a non-competitive football match of 32,188, was seen at a pre-season friendly against Spanish giants [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] on 30 July 2011.&lt;ref name="Highest Ever Attendance"&gt;{{cite news | title = Record crowd watch Leicester City play Real Madrid | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14363378 | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 1 August 2011 | accessdate = 31 October 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105144938/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14363378 | archive-date = 5 November 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester's highest ever league finish is first in the Premier League in [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16]]. Their lowest ever league finish was first in League One in [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]]. Leicester are joint equal with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for having won the most [[List of winners of English Football League Championship and predecessors|English second tier]] titles (7). The club has reached four [[FA Cup]] finals, yet lost them all.&lt;ref name="OBAF"/&gt; This is the record for the most [[FA Cup]] final appearances without winning the trophy.

Leicester's longest ever unbeaten run in the league was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009, to which they remained unbeaten for 23 games on their way to the [[Football League One|League One]] title.&lt;ref name="Leicester Mercury 2009-03-12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/escape-act-time-City/story-12077324-detail/story.html|title=No escape act this time, City!|date=12 March 2009|work=Leicester Mercury|accessdate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002163403/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/escape-act-time-City/story-12077324-detail/story.html|archivedate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was their only ever season in the third tier of English football). Their longest run of consecutive victories in the league is nine, which they achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 (in the Championship).

In the 2015–16 season, Leicester won what ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described as "one of the most astonishing league titles of all-time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/12/10/leicester-city-vs-man-city-premier-league-live/|title=Leicester City 4 Man City 2: Foxes find their ferocious side as Jamie Vardy hat-trick ends 16 match goal drought|author=Sam Wallace|date=10 December 2016|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved many new historical, club records. They had the fewest away defeats in any top flight season, as they were defeated only twice on their travels. They also recorded the fewest losses in any of the club's Premier League seasons, losing just three matches throughout their entire campaign. The club produced another record for the most consecutive wins in the top flight, each coming against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and Sunderland. Coincidentally, they kept a record of five-straight clean sheets all set against each of the same five opponents. The King Power Stadium home crowd in 2015–16 saw City beaten just once in the Premier League all season.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Leicester made their [[UEFA Champions League]] debut in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17 season]], their fourth appearance in European football. The club became the third English team to win on their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They are also the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=TheOddsBible |number=788483770680745984 |date=18 October 2016 |title=Leicester are the first English side ever to win their first three Champions League games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/27/leicester-city-become-first-english-team-to-win-their-first-two-champions-league-games-6156977/|title=Leicester City make BEST EVER start to Champions League life by English club|first=Max |last=Miller |work=Metro.co.uk|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=SkySportsStatto |number=793930648390078464 |date=2 November 2016 |title=@LCFC are the 1st team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in their opening 4 games in the competition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the club's [[2015–16 Premier League]] title winning season, between September 2015 and November 2016 the team went 20 league games unbeaten at home. The stint was ended by [[West Bromwich Albion]] on 6 November 2016 in a 1–2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/leicester-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report|title=West Bromwich's Matt Phillips pounces to end Leicester's unbeaten home run|first=Paul| last=Doyle|date=6 November 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/transfer/news/11096/10641971/leicester8217s-unbeaten-premier-league-home-record-is-among-the-best-in-europe|title=Leicester's unbeaten Premier League home record is among the best in Europe|work=[[Sky Sports]]|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 December 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the club became the 50th team to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.

==League history==
{{See also|List of Leicester City F.C. seasons}}
Since their election to the [[Football League]] in 1894, Leicester have spent much of their history within the top two tiers of English football. Leicester have played outside the top two tiers only once in their history to date; during the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season they played in [[Football League One|League One]], the third tier of English football, after relegation from [[Football League Championship|the Championship]] the season prior. However, they made a swift return to the second tier, as they were promoted as champions in the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]]. The club have never played lower than England's third tier.

'''Newcastle United Football Club''' is an English professional [[association football]] club based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football. Newcastle United was founded in 1892 by the merger of [[Newcastle East End F.C.|Newcastle East End]] and [[Newcastle West End F.C.|Newcastle West End]], and has played at its current home ground, [[St James' Park]], ever since. The ground was developed into an [[all-seater stadium]] in the mid-1990s and has a capacity of 52,354.&lt;ref name="premierleague.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/content/dam/premierleague/site-content/News/publications/handbooks/premier-league-handbook-2013-14.pdf |title=Premier League Handbook Season 2013/14 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 August 2013 |work=[[Premier League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122060849/http://www.premierleague.com/content/dam/premierleague/site-content/News/publications/handbooks/premier-league-handbook-2013-14.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 85 seasons in the top tier as of May 2016, and has never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the [[Football League]] in 1893. They have won four [[List of English football champions|League Championship]] titles, six [[FA Cup]]s and a [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], as well as the [[1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] and the [[2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of trophies won by an English club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/02/englands-ten-most-successful-clubs-chelsea-still-way-behind-arsenal-liverpool-man-united-despite-capital-one-cup-win/|title=England's Ten Most Successful Clubs: Chelsea Still Way Behind Arsenal, Liverpool &amp; Man United Despite Capital One Cup Win|first=Mark|last=Brus|date=2 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club were highly successful in the Premier League in the 1990s and early 2000s without winning any trophies, but have been mostly struggling since the 2006–07 season, and were relegated in 2009 and 2016. They returned to the Premier League for the [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18 season]] after winning the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] title the preceding year.

Newcastle has a fierce local rivalry with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and the two clubs have engaged in the [[Tyne–Wear derby]] since 1898. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their traditional crest takes elements of the city [[coat of arms]], which features two grey seahorses. Prior to each home game the team enters the field to "[[Local Hero (album)|Local Hero]]", written by Newcastle native [[Mark Knopfler]], while "[[Blaydon Races]]" is invariably sung during games.&lt;ref name="Hero"&gt;Anthony Bateman (2008). "Sporting Sounds: Relationships Between Sport and Music". p. 186. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has been owned by [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] since 2007, succeeding long term chairman and owner [[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]]. The club is the [[Deloitte Football Money League|17th]]-highest revenue producing club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating [[Euro|€]]169.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2015. Historically, Newcastle's highest placing was in 1999, when they were the fifth-highest revenue producing football club in the world, and second in England only behind [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref name =Del1999&gt;{{cite news| title = Man Utd 'Richest club in the world'| quote = The next British side on the list, at fifth, is Newcastle United... | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 1 December 1999 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/543805.stm | accessdate = 11 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Newcastle United FC League Performance.svg|thumb|A chart showing the progress of Newcastle United Football Club from its entry into the League in 1894 to the present. Newcastle have won the league on four occasions.]]

The first record of football being played on [[Tyneside]] dates from 3 March 1877 at [[Northern Football Club|Elswick Rugby Club]]. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the ''Stanley Cricket Club'' of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed ''[[Newcastle East End F.C.]]'' in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, ''[[Newcastle West End F.C.]]'' formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].&lt;ref name=formation&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs became rivals in the [[Northern Football League (England)|Northern League]]. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the other hand, Newcastle West End were in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a take over. Newcastle West End were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;

With only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the [[The Football League|Football League's]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] at the start of the [[1892–93 in English football|1892–93]] season, they were invited to play in their new [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating "gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling".&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt; Suggested names included Newcastle F.C., Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but ''Newcastle United'' was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon |last=Turnbull |title=Football: Only one United? Why we are united in our disgust |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990516/ai_n14232962 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118070423/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990516/ai_n14232962 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 January 2008 |work=The Independent |date=16 May 1999 |accessdate=8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; At the start of the [[1893–94 in English football|1893–94]] season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=formation /&gt; They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2–2.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Turnstile numbers were still low, and the incensed club published a statement stating, "The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned". However, eventually figures picked up by [[1895–96 in English football|1895–96]], when 14,000 fans watched the team play [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. That season [[Frank Watt (football manager)|Frank Watt]] became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the [[1898–99 in English football|1898–99]] season. However, they lost their first game 4–2 at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and finished their first season in thirteenth place.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[File:FACupFinal1905NewcastleVilla.jpg|thumb|right|Harry Hampton scores one of his two goals in the 1905 FA Cup final against Aston Villa]]
In [[1903–04 in English football|1903–04]], the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their "artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing". Long after his retirement, [[Peter McWilliam]], the team's [[Defender (association football)|defender]] at the time, said, "The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot." Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; [[1904–05 Football League|1904–05]], [[1906–07 Football League|1906–07]] and [[1908–09 Football League|1908–09]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle United, "Newcastle United Trophy cabinet which has been empty for many a year." |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/venue/0,19753,11065_59,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024143134/http://www.skysports.com/football/venue/0%2C19753%2C11065_59%2C00.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904–05, they nearly did the double, losing to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the [[1905 FA Cup Final]]. They were beaten again the following year by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[1906 FA Cup Final]]. They reached the final again in [[1908 FA Cup Final|1908]] where they lost to Wolves. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in the [[1910 FA Cup Final|final]]. They lost again the following year in the [[1911 FA Cup Final|final]] against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The team returned to the [[1924 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final in 1924]], in the second final held at the then new [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. They defeated [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], winning the club's second [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Three years later they won the First Division championship a fourth time in [[1926–27 Football League|1926–27]], with [[Hughie Gallacher]], one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were [[Neil Harris (footballer born 1894)|Neil Harris]], [[Stan Seymour]] and [[Frank Hudspeth]]. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and at the same time [[Andy Cunningham (footballer)|Andy Cunningham]] became the club's first team manager. In [[1931–32 Football League|1931–32]], the club won the [[1932 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the [[1933–34 Football League|1933–34 season]], the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and [[Tom Mather]] took over.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the [[1937–38 Football League|1937–38 season]], when they were spared on goal averages. However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in [[Jackie Milburn]], [[Tommy Walker (footballer, born 1923)|Tommy Walker]] and [[Bobby Cowell]]. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48 season]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; During the 1950s, Newcastle won the [[FA Cup]] trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in [[1951 FA Cup Final|1951]], Arsenal in [[1952 FA Cup Final|1952]], and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in [[1955 FA Cup Final|1955]]. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61 season]] under the management of [[Charlie Mitten]]. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player [[Joe Harvey]]. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the [[1964–65 in English football|1964–65 season]] after winning the Second Division title.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]] and the following year won the [[1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final]], triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's [[Újpest FC|Újpest]] in the final.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===The 70s and 80s===
Harvey bought striker [[Malcolm Macdonald]] in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]180,000 (worth ₤{{inflation|UK|180000|1971}} in 2016).&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lee took the team to the [[1976 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said "I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over". Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by [[Richard Dinnis]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78 season]]. Dinnis was replaced by [[Bill McGarry (footballer)|Bill McGarry]], and then he was replaced by [[Arthur Cox (football)|Arthur Cox]]. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84 season]], with players such as [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Chris Waddle]] and ex-[[English national football team|England]] captain [[Kevin Keegan]] the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and Keegan retired. With managers such as [[Jack Charlton]] and then [[Willie McFaul]], Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and [[Paul Gascoigne]] were sold, and the team was relegated once more in [[1988–89 in English football|1989]]. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]]. Smith left at the start of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]] and the board appointed [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] his replacement.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]] became the club's chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, and he brought in [[Rob Lee]], [[Paul Bracewell]] and [[Barry Venison]] and the club won the then [[Football League Championship|First Division Championship]] at the end of the [[1992–93 Newcastle United F.C. season|1992–93 season]], earning promotion to the then new [[Premier League]]. At the end of the [[1993–94 Newcastle United F.C. season|1993–94 season]], their first year back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled "The Entertainers" by [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] and [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]], coming very close to winning the title in the former season. This success was in part due to the talent of players like [[David Ginola]], [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Alan Shearer]], who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15&amp;nbsp;million.

Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by [[Kenny Dalglish]], however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the [[1997–98 FA Premier League]], failure to progress beyond the group stages of the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League]] despite beating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and group winners [[FC Dynamo Kiev|Dynamo Kiev]] at [[St James' Park]] as well as coming from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with [[Valery Lobanovsky]]'s team in [[Ukraine]] and defeat in the [[1998 FA Cup Final]].

In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=kits&gt;{{cite news

United's away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]], but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993. Since 1995, the [[away kit]] has changed consistently and has not been the same for more than a single season.&lt;ref name=kits2&gt;{{cite news

Football had been played at St James' Park as early as 1880, the ground being occupied by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] in 1886. Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.&lt;ref name=formation /&gt;&lt;ref name=st_james&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal Palace Football Club''' is an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Selhurst]], [[South London]], that competes in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. They were founded in 1905 at the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building and played their home games at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. The club were forced to leave the Palace in 1915 due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], and played at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]] and [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] until 1924, when they moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]]. 

Palace have had several periods competing in the top level of English football. They enjoyed a successful period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during which the club achieved its highest ever league finish of third place in the top division in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]], and were only denied a place in Europe because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club were also one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace have been [[FA Cup]] finalists twice, finishing runners-up to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in both [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. The club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE UNLIKELY RIVALRY BETWEEN BRIGHTON AND CRYSTAL PALACE |url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2017/8/7/the-unlikely-rivalry-between-brighton-and-crystal-palace |publisher=In Bed With Maradona |date=7 August 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904195219/http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2017/8/7/the-unlikely-rivalry-between-brighton-and-crystal-palace |archive-date=4 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

==History==
{{main article|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}

[[File:Crystal Palace Year Book 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|alt=Front cover of a year book.|right|The Crystal Palace F.C. Year Book for 1912–13]]

In 1895, the Football Association had found a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] at the site of the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own football team to play at the Palace stadium. There had been an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team as early as 1861, but they had disappeared from historical records around 1876. The owners of the venue wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club. 

Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed "The Glaziers", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=3 June 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Unfortunately for Palace, it was Chelsea that were accepted and the club found itself in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division for the [[1905–06 Southern Football League|1905–06]] season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the First Division, crowned as champions.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runners-up to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to [[New Brompton F.C.|New Brompton]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the [[Newcastle United F.C. 0–1 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1907 shock First Round victory]] over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name=TOON&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Roger|title=The Toon: A Complete History of Newcastle United Football Club|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-78057-314-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJsZeq7myAC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=newcastle+crystal+palace+1907&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W0Zojga18D&amp;sig=yAD9saB6DPx6xumFSbUn2DRsPyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WtzCUZuvAsLP0QX2lIHoBg&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter |first=Steve |title=All time greatest F A cup giant killings Number 11 Newcastle United 0–1 Crystal Palace |url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm |work=The Giant Killers |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080520/http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm |archivedate= 8 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[First World War]] led to the [[Admiralty]] requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of West Norwood F.C. at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]].&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; Three years later they moved again to [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] due to the folding of [[Croydon Common F.C.]]. The club joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21 season]], finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League|Wartime Leagues]], the South Regional League and the South 'D' League. After the war, the club were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]]. The club remained in Division Three South until [[1957–58 in English football|1957–58]]. A league reorganisation would see clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. New chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed [[Arthur Rowe]] as manager, and the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61]] season saw Palace gain promotion. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in a friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had played a match in London. Although Rowe then stepped down for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963–64 in English football|1963–64]] and [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20, 32–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, but then experienced great disappointment. Under the management of [[Malcolm Allison]] the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club became nicknamed "The Eagles" and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the [[1975-76 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 1975–76 campaign, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]] and again in [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79]], the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions. That team from 1979 was dubbed "The team of the Eighties" and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season, before financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break up of that talented side, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain their position in the top flight. They were relegated from the First Division in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]] takeover of the club.

On 4 June 1984, former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3–3 with Manchester United in the first match but losing the replay 1–0. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4–1 ([[extra time|after extra time]]) in the final.&lt;ref name="Business: Club History"/&gt; During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992–93.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.&amp;nbsp;39–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994–95.]]
The club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. Steve Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which [[Eric Cantona]] was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cantona affair: Palace offer Frenchman no sympathy |first=Martin |last=Whitfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6fPYXhX?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and retaliated with a flying kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soccer star attacks a fan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DUNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=crystal%20palace&amp;pg=1390%2C6363284|date=27 January 1995|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=The Gainesville Sun|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jail term may make Cantona quit UK |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |first=Steve |last=Boggan |date=24 March 1995 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |work=The Independent |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6fW0Cet?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced to 120 hours [[community service]] on appeal.

Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of [[Ray Lewington]] and latterly [[Dave Bassett]]'s managership Palace reached the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]]. Palace lost the [[1996 Football League First Division play-off Final|1996 play-off final]] in dramatic fashion, [[Steve Claridge]] scoring a last minute goal for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to win the tie 2–1. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in early 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bassett quits Palace and joins Forest|agency=Reuters|work=The Nation|location=Bangkok|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKZNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s0MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bassett%20nottingham%20forest%20manager&amp;pg=6362%2C145781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when they defeated [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the final at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–2&lt;/ref&gt;

This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true [[yo-yo club]] fashion Palace were relegated back to the First Division for the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season. The club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Palace then went into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] in 1999, when owner [[Mark Goldberg]] was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club.&lt;ref name=BBC289590&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/289590.stm| title=The Company File: Palace on the rocks| date=3 March 1999| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=26 August 2009| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6gcvDeu?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/289590.stm| archive-date=3 June 2013| dead-url=no| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club emerged from administration under the ownership of [[Simon Jordan]], and Steve Coppell left, replaced by Alan Smith for a second time.

Smith was sacked in April and [[Steve Kember]] managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee survival, [[Dougie Freedman]] scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the 87th minute on the final day of the season.

During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. Led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]], the vocal representative for the consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, [[Jeremy Hosking]] and [[Martin Long]]. Crucially, the consortium also secured the freehold of the ground, and paid tribute to a fans' campaign which helped pressure Lloyds Bank into selling the ground back to the club. The consortium swiftly installed [[George Burley]] as the new Palace manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8745764.stm|title=Crystal Palace appoint George Burley as new boss|work=BBC Sport|date=17 June 2010|access-date=21 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113005219/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8745764.stm|archive-date=13 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a poor start to the season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December.

==Colours and crest==
When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.&lt;ref name=GNTSOTB&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicking the shirts off their backs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 November 2005 |author=Georgina Turner |author2=James Dart |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhJ9PvUd?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RG1&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Palace's colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938. The 1937–38 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but in 1938 they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace|work=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906064705/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm|archive-date=6 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|alt=Mono photograph of the front of the Palace and some of its surrounding grounds.|[[The Crystal Palace]], the façade of which appears on the club crest.]]
There were variations on this theme until 1963 when the club adopted the away strip of yellow jersey as the home colours. In 1964 the club adopted an all-white strip modelled on [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] whom the club had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until [[Malcolm Allison]]'s arrival as manager in 1973.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=GNTSOTB/&gt; Palace have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt;

The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of [[The Crystal Palace]] did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts in 1967–72. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the club's initials and nickname "the Glaziers" before Allison changed this too.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; The nickname became "the Eagles", inspired by Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace façade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott |first=Ken |title=Facelift for Crystal Palace's 'Benfica eagle' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=27 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhI4xKrQ?url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and although updated in 1996 and again in 2013, the crest retains these features.&lt;ref name="HFK"/&gt; Since mid-2010, the club has made use of an [[American bald eagle]], called Kayla, as the club [[mascot]], with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/crystal_palace_eagles_will_be_flying_high_with_new_mascot_1_634203|title=Crystal Palace Eagles will be flying high with new mascot|date=8 September 2010|work=Bromley Times|publisher=Archant Community Media|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502043130/http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/crystal_palace_eagles_will_be_flying_high_with_new_mascot_1_634203|archive-date=2 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.howzit.msn.com/kayla-the-next-breed-of-mascot?page=12|title=Kayla – The Next Breed of Mascot|date=12 December 2013|work=Howzit MSN Sport|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502043514/http://sports.howzit.msn.com/kayla-the-next-breed-of-mascot?page=12|archive-date=2 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
{{Main article|Selhurst Park}}
In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Crystal Palace FA Cup Finals 1895.E2.80.931914|FA Cup Final]] venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area. They formed a new club called Crystal Palace F.C., to play at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[First World War]] broke out the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the [[Admiralty]]. They found a temporary base at the [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. Although other clubs had offered the use of their ground to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Croydon Common F.C.]] were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium located at [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]],&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1919 they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build [[Selhurst Park]], their current home.&lt;ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5"&gt;Matthews pp. 30, 33–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The renowned stadium architect, [[Archibald Leitch]], was employed to draw up plans, and the club constructed and completed the ground in time for the [[1924-25 in English football|1924–25 season]].&lt;ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5" /&gt; It remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and maintenance and updating until 1969 when the Arthur Wait stand was constructed. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, club offices and a club shop.

==Support base==
[[File:HOLMSDALE_FANATICS.jpg|thumb|The Holmesdale Fanatics passionate home support.]]
Crystal Palace have a fan base predominantly from the local area which draws on [[South London]], [[Kent]], and [[Surrey]]. Their original home, at The Crystal Palace, was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the [[London Government Act 1963]] saw [[Greater London]] encompass [[Croydon]]. The club's passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the Holmesdale Fanatics have been based since 2005.

The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters' Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/ |work=Palace Independent Supporters Association |accessdate=27 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hh2BgmdZ?url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000. The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building "a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do |url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/ |work=Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust |accessdate=27 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hh25IwjO?url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[fanzines]] have been produced by the fans over the years. ''Eagle Eye'' launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement ''Palace Echo'' in 1995, running until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Palace Echo |url=http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104121826/http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Eastern Eagles'', ''So Glad You're Mine'' and ''One More Point'' were also published by fans in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Football Fanzines For Sale – (Part 2 – Clubs From C – D) | url=http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | accessdate=15 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528030035/http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | archive-date=28 May 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''One More Point'' ceased publication, ''Five Year Plan'' launched in its place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About FYP |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |accessdate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719170204/http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains an online presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ |title=Five Year Plan |accessdate=15 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720030445/http://fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ |archive-date=20 July 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters also congregate on two [[internet forum]]s, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |title=Crystal Palace F.C.Fans' Charter Season 2012/13 |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2012 |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201223/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base. The Foundation's work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do |url=http://cpfcfoundation.org/what-we-do/ |work=Crystal Palace F.C.

The club also maintains a sizeable celebrity support. The Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] has been an avid supporter of the club all his life. [[Kevin Day]] and [[Jo Brand]] host an annual comedy night for [[Comic Relief]] and the Palace Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloss |first=Andrew |title=Tickets still on sale for Crystal Palace comedy night |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/leisure/leisurenews/10453140.Tickets_still_on_sale_for_Crystal_Palace_comedy_night/ |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Croydon Guardian |date=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhFXSCvg?url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/leisure/leisurenews/10453140.Tickets_still_on_sale_for_Crystal_Palace_comedy_night/ |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the club also count fellow comedians [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Harry Enfield]], [[Mark Steel]], [[Jim Piddock]], and [[Roy Hudd]] amongst their fans.

==Rivalries==
{{See also|M23 derby|South London derby}}

Due to their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across [[South London derby|South London]]. They enjoy rivalries with both [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and former tenants [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. They have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] which did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976–77 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 1–0 and a fierce rivalry was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burnton |first=Simon |title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry |accessdate=26 June 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hfnuq6Kd?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry |archivedate=26 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
[[File:Sydney Bourne and Edmund Goodman circa 1906.jpg|right|alt=Low resolution monochrome photo of two men.|thumb|First chairman [[Sydney Bourne]] with [[Edmund Goodman]], 1906.]]
Due to the [[Football Association]] not wishing the owners of the FA Cup Final venue to also possess their own football team, a separate company was established to form and own the club. The first chairman, [[Sydney Bourne]], was found by club secretary [[Edmund Goodman]] after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Local businessman [[Arthur Wait]] established a consortium of seven other businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and they initially rotated the chairmanship.&lt;ref name="CA1"&gt;{{cite news | title=Behind-The-Scenes Shuffle at Palace | work=Croydon Advertiser | date=August 1972 | author=Matthews, John|quote="...&amp;nbsp;whose board he joined in 1948"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CA3&gt;"New Man Bloye Kills 'Moneybags' Tag", ''Croydon Advertiser'', 27 October 1972, p.58 "Twenty two years ago&amp;nbsp;... seven men formed a board&amp;nbsp;...

''Times'' [London, England] 27 October 1972: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloye's ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer [[Ron Noades]] and his small consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to [[Mark Goldberg]] on 5 June 1998, becoming the second longest serving chairman behind Sydney Bourne. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and the club entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group, the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire [[Simon Jordan]] negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, and it was not until June of that year that a takeover was completed by a consortium of four wealthy fans known as CPFC 2010.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–60&lt;/ref&gt;

CPFC 2010 was established by a consortium of four businessmen, [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]], [[Martin Long (businessman)|Martin Long]], Stephen Browett and [[Jeremy Hosking]] in 2010, with each owning a 25% share of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moody |first=Graham |title=Crystal Palace post £5m loss |url=http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/sport/9572656.Crystal_Palace_post___5m_loss/ |accessdate=1 June 2013 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=6 March 2012 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6jcxFEQ?url=http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/sport/9572656.Crystal_Palace_post___5m_loss/ |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Certificate of Incorporation|date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four successfully negotiated a take-over with the administrator Brendan Guilfoyle and a [[company voluntary arrangement]] was formally accepted by company creditors on 20 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace come out of administration |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8930854.stm |accessdate=27 June 2013 |date=20 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhBcbNh4?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8930854.stm |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPFC 2010 also purchased the ground from [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] after a demonstration by fans put pressure on the bank to agree terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace fans stage demonstration against Lloyds Bank as deadline looms |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/01/crystal-palace-lloyds-bank-demonstration |accessdate=27 June 2013 |date=1 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhB5YDm3?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/01/crystal-palace-lloyds-bank-demonstration |archivedate=27 June 2013 |agency=Press Association |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title=Crystal Palace granted reprieve after principle agreement over sale of club and ground |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/7794816/Crystal-Palace-granted-reprieve-after-principle-agreement-over-sale-of-club-and-ground.html |accessdate=27 June 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HhBIKjfA?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/7794816/Crystal-Palace-granted-reprieve-after-principle-agreement-over-sale-of-club-and-ground.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2015, it was announced that a new deal had been signed with American investors [[Joshua Harris (businessman)|Josh Harris]] and [[David S. Blitzer|David Blitzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace: Deal agreed with US investors Harris and Blitzer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35138750|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=19 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219080614/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35138750|archive-date=19 December 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club stated that Steve Parish would continue as chairman alongside Harris and Blitzer as general partners in a new structure, and that Browett, Long and Hosking would also retain a substantial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment Deal Is Signed|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/december/investment-deal-is-signed-/|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later company accounts showed that the ownership figures were: Steve Parish 18%, Steve Browett 5%, Jeremy Hosking 5% and Martin Long 2.5% with the remainder being owned by Palace Holdco LP (a limited partnership registered in Delaware) 67.5% and Palace Parallel LLC (a company also registered in Delaware) 1.5%. Both Palace Holdco and Palace Parallel have 180 preference shares each. As the Delaware companies do not have to reveal their owners the exact ownership of the club is therefore unknown but Steve Parish confirmed that each of Harris and Blitzer had an 18% share to match his own.

[[File:CrystalPalaceFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing Crystal Palace's table positions since joining the Football League.]]Palace were inaugural champions of the newly formed [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21]], which was also their first ever season in the Football League and so became one of only a small group of clubs to have achieved the feat of winning a Football League Division at the first time of asking. Their average league attendance of 19,092 in the [[1960–61 Football League|1960–61]] season and the attendance of 37,774 for the [[Good Friday]] game at [[Selhurst Park]] between Palace and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] the same season are [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] attendance records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm | title=Division Four 1960/61 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm | archive-date=3 June 2013 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace's record home attendance is 51,482 for a Division Two match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 11 May 1979.&lt;ref name=K444/&gt; With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. The club's widest victory margin in the league was their 9–0 win against [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]] in the Fourth Division in 1959, while their heaviest defeat in the league was by the same scoreline, 9–0, against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 1989 in Division One.&lt;ref name=K444&gt;King, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest transfer fee received for a Palace player is £25 million, from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for [[Yannick Bolasie]] in August 2016, while the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date was for [[Christian Benteke]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] also in August 2016, for £32&amp;nbsp;million. 

The club's highest ever league finish so far is third place in the [[Football League First Division]], which is now called the [[Premier League]], achieved in the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]] season. Palace hold the record for the most points for a relegated Premier League club, with 49 points (although that was in a 42-game season in [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]]).&lt;ref name=relegation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy/2018/aug/24/premier-league-40-point-mark-relegation-crystal-palace |title=Premier League managers should forget the mythical 40-point mark |last=Foster |first=Richard |date=24 August 2018 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |access-date=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished fourth from bottom, as it had been decided that at the end of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season, the bottom four clubs would be relegated in order to accommodate the league being reduced in size from 22 to 20 clubs for the [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96 season]]; Palace's points total that season of 45 is also the second-highest points total in Premier League history for a relegated club.&lt;ref name=relegation /&gt; Palace hold the record for the most Play-off final wins (4) resulting in promotion to the top flight. Each of these play-off final victories occurred at a different location: Selhurst Park in 1989 (the first leg of the two-legged final was played at [[Ewood Park]] in [[Blackburn]]), [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley Stadium]] in 1997, [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] in 2004, and [[Wembley Stadium|new Wembley]] in 2013.

'''Burnley Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|n|l|i}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition match|friendly matches]] until they entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885–86 in English football|1885–86]]. The club currently plays in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed ''the [[Bordeaux wine#"Claret" term|Clarets]]'', due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888–89 Football League|1888]].

Burnley have been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920–21 in English football|1920–21]] and [[1959–60 in English football|1959–60]], have won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and have won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. ''The Clarets'' also reached the [[1960–61 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. They are one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].

In the [[1920–21 Burnley F.C. season|1920–21]] campaign, Burnley were crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{ref label|Topdivision|A|}} During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by [[Nottingham Forest]] in the late 1970s. Burnley attained a second league championship in [[1959–60 Burnley F.C. season|1959–60]] with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], after foundations were laid by pioneers [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]] and [[Harry Potts]].

Just twenty years later, in [[1979–80 Burnley F.C. season|1979–80]], Burnley were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] — the first time in their history they had played in the third tier of English football. Five years later, the team competed in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2–1 home win against [[Orient F.C.|Orient]] saved Burnley from relegation to the [[Football Conference]] and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in [[1991–92 Burnley F.C. season|1991–92]] to the third tier and again in [[1999–2000 Burnley F.C. season|1999–2000]] to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in [[2008–09 Burnley F.C. season|2008–09]], [[2013–14 Burnley F.C. season|2013–14]] and [[2015–16 Burnley F.C. season|2015–16]].

Burnley have played home games at Turd Moor since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from their original premises at ''Calder Vale''. The club colours of [[claret]] and blue were adopted prior to the 1910–11 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Their current manager, [[Sean Dyche]], was appointed on 30 October 2012.

==History==

===Early years (1882–1912)===
[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|The Burnley team of 1889]]
On 18 May 1882, ''Burnley Rovers Football Club'' decided to shift their allegiance from [[rugby union]] to [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2016/may/on-this-day-may-18/|title=Burnley Football Club On This Day: May 18|access-date=25 December 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing in various green or blue and white kits for their first few years, the club played their first competitive game in October 1882 against ''Astley Bridge'' in the Lancashire Challenge Cup, that game ending in an 8–0 defeat.&lt;ref name=BurnleyFCMiscellany&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Burnley FC Miscellany|last=Wiseman|first=David|publisher=DB Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781780911045|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early months of 1883 the club moved to [[Turf Moor]] and remain there, only their Lancashire rivals [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] having continuously occupied the same ground for longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://memim.com/turf-moor.html|title=Turf Moor|website=memim.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley first appeared in the [[FA Cup]] in [[1885–86 in English football|1885–86]],&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014" /&gt; but were ignominiously beaten 11–0 when eligibility restrictions meant that their reserve side had to be fielded against ''Darwen Old Wanderers''.&lt;ref name=BurnleyFCMiscellany /&gt; A year later, on 13 October 1886, Turf Moor became the first ground to be visited by a member of the [[British royal family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref name=SidanPress&gt;Fiszman, Marc; Peters, Mark (2005). Kick Off Championship 2005–06. Sidan Press. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was decided to found [[the Football League]] for the [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]] season, Burnley were among the twelve founders of that competition, and one of the six clubs based in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="football league founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1888-89.html|title= England 1888–89|publisher= Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley's [[William Tait (footballer)|William Tait]] became the first player to score a [[hat-trick]] in league football in only the second match of the inaugural season, when his three goals gave ''the Clarets'' an away win to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;When Saturday Comes: The Half Decent Football Book. p 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley, now known as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''The Turfites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Moorites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or '''Royalites''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' as a result of the name of their new ground and the royal connection, eventually finished 9th in the first season of the league, but only one place from bottom in [[1889–90 in English football|1889–90]], following a 17-game winless streak at the start of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1889-90.html England 1889–90] Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; That season did, however, present Burnley with their first honours, winning the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] with a 2–0 final victory over local rivals [[Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Clarets Chronicles: The Definitive History of Burnley Football Club 1882–2007|last=Simpson|first=Ray|publisher=Burnley F.C.|year=2007|isbn=9780955746802|location=|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Burnley won a trophy again, they were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first time in [[1896–97 in English football|1896–97]]. They responded to this by winning promotion the [[1897–98 in English football|next season]], losing only two of their 30 matches along the way before gaining promotion through a play-off series, then known as ''[[Football League test matches|test matches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1897-98.html England 1897–98] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205051045/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1897-98.html |date=5 February 2010 }} Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley and [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] both entered the last match, to be played between the two teams, needing a draw for promotion (or in Stoke's case to retain their First Division place). A 0–0 draw ensued, reportedly "''The match without a shot at goal''",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Football's Strangest Matches: Extraordinary but True Stories from Over a Century of Football|last=Ward|first=Andrew|publisher=Portico|year=2016|isbn=9781910232866|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the league immediately withdrew the test match system in favour of automatic promotion and relegation. Ironically, the league also decided to expand the top division after the test match series of [[1897–98 in English football|1897–98]] and the other two teams also went into the top division for the following year, negating the effect of Burnley and Stoke City's reputed collusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1898-99.html England 1898–99] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205051026/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1898-99.html |date=5 February 2010 }} Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley were relegated again in [[1899–1900 in English football|1899–1900]] and found themselves at the centre of a controversy when their goalkeeper, [[Jack Hillman]] attempted to bribe their opponents, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in the last match of the season, resulting in his suspension for the whole of the following season. It was the earliest recorded case of [[match fixing]] in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/09/theknowledge.sport|title=The earliest recorded case of match-fixing|last=Dart|first=James|last2=Bandini|first2=Paolo|date=9 August 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decade of the 20th century, Burnley continued to play in the Second Division, even finishing in bottom place in one season, although the indications of success just around the corner were evident. Burnley changed their colours from green to the claret and sky blue of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], the most successful club in England at the time, for the [[1910–11 in English football|1910–11]] season, as manager [[John Haworth]] believed it might bring a change of fortune.&lt;ref name="historicalkits"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Burnley/Burnley.htm|title=Burnley – Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/edw1/100_years_of_claret_and_blue__part_1_747385/index.shtml|title=100 Years of Claret and Blue – Part 1 – Clarets Mad|last=|first=|date=|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tides did indeed turn the [[1911–12 in English football|following season]], when only a loss in the last game of the season denied the club promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/fla/1911-12.html|title=England 1911/12|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley continued to improve, as the [[1912–13 in English football|1912–13]] season saw them win promotion to the First Division once more, as well as reaching the [[FA Cup]] semi-final, only to lose to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. The next season was one of consolidation in the top flight, but more importantly their first major honour, the FA Cup, was won, against fellow Lancastrians [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the final ([[1914 FA Cup Final|1–0]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/burnley-defeat-liverpool-in-fa-cup-final|title=Burnley defeat Liverpool in FA Cup Final {{!}} Century Ireland|website=www.rte.ie|language=en|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-[[Everton F.C.|Evertonian]] [[Bert Freeman]], whose father travelled from Australia to see his son play in the final,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2014/april/families-of-burnleys-1914-heroes-join-in-the-turf-moor-celebrations/|title=Families of Burnley’s 1914 heroes join in the Turf Moor celebrations|last=Simpson|first=Ray|date=28 April 2014|work=Burnley Football Club|access-date=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; scored the only goal, as Burnley became the first club to beat five First Division clubs in one cup season.&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014" /&gt; This was the last final to be played at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] became the first reigning monarch to present the cup to the winning captain, in this case to [[Tommy Boyle (footballer, born 1886)|Tommy Boyle]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Mike 2014"&gt;Smith, Mike.

World War I impacted the [[1914–15 in English football|1914–15]] season, in which Burnley finished 4th in the First Division, before English football reorganised itself and took a back seat to the needs of the conflict. Upon resumption of full-time football in [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20]], Burnley finished second in the First Division to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], but this was not a peak, merely presaging Burnley's first ever League Championship in [[1920–21 Burnley F.C. season|1920–21]].&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1920-21.html|title= England 1920–21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205195213/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1920-21.html |archivedate=5 February 2010|publisher= Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley lost their opening three matches that season before going on a 30-match unbeaten run, a record for unbeaten games in a single season that lasted until [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] went unbeaten through the whole of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061212/http://www.givemefootball.com/club-list/burnley|title=Burnley News &amp; Players {{!}} The Clarets {{!}} Give Me Football|date=1 January 2011|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley finished third the following season, but thereafter followed a steady deterioration of their position, with only 5th place in [[1926–27 in English football|1926–27]] offering respite from a series of near-relegations which culminated in demotion in [[1929–30 in English football|1929–30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1929-30.html|title=England 1929/30|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low points through World War II (1930–1945)===
Burnley struggled in English football's second tier, narrowly avoiding a further relegation in [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32]] by only two points. The years through to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] were characterised by uninspiring league finishes, broken only by a FA Cup semi-final appearance in [[1934–35 in English football|1934–35]] and the arrival (and equally swift departure) of [[English Football Hall of Fame]] inductee and centre-forward [[Tommy Lawton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-tommy-lawton-1351115.html|title=Obituary: Tommy Lawton|date=7 November 1996|work=The Independent|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley participated in the varying football leagues that continued throughout the war, but it wasn't until the [[1946–47 in English football|1946–47]] season that league football proper was restored.

===Golden, progressive era under Bob Lord, Alan Brown and Harry Potts (1946–1976)===
In the [[1946–47 Football League|first season]] of post-war league football, Burnley gained promotion through second place in the Second Division. Additionally, there was a run to the [[FA Cup Final]], with [[Aston Villa]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] being defeated before [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] beat Burnley [[1947 FA Cup Final|1–0 after extra time]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1426045.No_17__1947_FA_Cup_final/|title=No 17: 1947 FA Cup final|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley immediately made an impact the top division, finishing third in [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48]] as the club began to assemble a team capable of regularly aiming for honours.

Burnley became one of the most progressive clubs around from the following decade, the 1950s, to the early 1970s under the reign of lifelong Burnley supporter and newly appointed chairman [[Bob Lord (football chairman)|Bob Lord]].&lt;ref name=footballerpink&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://footballpink.net/2015/12/20/the-khrushchev-of-burnley/|title=The Khrushchev of Burnley|date=20 December 2015|access-date=24 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gameofthepeople"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameofthepeople.com/2013/08/09/great-reputations-burnley-1959-60-a-good-year-for-claret/|title=Great Reputations: Burnley 1959–60 – a good year for claret|website=Game of the People|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first teams to build a training ground, while most teams trained on public parks or at their own grounds.&lt;ref name=footballerpink /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5206703/Burnley-legend-Jimmy-Robson-talks-winning-title.html|title=Jimmy Robson talks about winning the title and playing in Europe|work=Mail Online|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the club became, after foundations were laid by Lord and manager [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Football Man: People &amp; Passions in Soccer|last=Hopcraft|first=Arthur|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|year=2013|isbn=978-1781311516|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/burnley_fc/news/1422640.John_Connelly_life_story__Part_1/|title=John Connelly life story: Part 1|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; renowned for their youth policy and scouting system, which yielded many young players over the years such as club legends [[Jimmy McIlroy]], [[Willie Morgan]] and [[Martin Dobson]].&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Never Had it So Good: Burnley's Incredible 1959/60 League Title Triumph|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781848186002|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/midweek-clarets-legends-this-week-its-harry-potts/8537710/|title=Midweek Clarets' Legends - This Week it's Harry Potts|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|work=sport.co.uk|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his relatively short spell at the club from 1954 to 1957, Brown also introduced short corners and a huge array of free kick routines, which were soon copied across the land.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stuart.

The team of this period revolved around the midfield duo of [[Jimmy Adamson]] and [[Jimmy McIlroy]] (a new stand was named after the latter in the 1990s) and these two were key to the championship-winning team of [[1959–60 Burnley F.C. season|1959–60]] managed by Potts (who now gives his name to the road which [[Turf Moor]] occupies).

Burnley endured a tense 1959–60 season in which [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] were the other protagonists in the chase for the league title, but the club ultimately clinched their second league championship on the last day of the season at [[Maine Road]], [[Manchester]] with a 2–1 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] with goals from [[Brian Pilkington (footballer)|Brian Pilkington]] and [[Trevor Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/14567385._We_weren_t_jumping_around__we_d_only_won_the_league____Burnley_legend_on_the_day_the_Clarets_were_crowned_Kings_of_England/|title='We weren't jumping around, we'd only won the league' – Burnley legend on the day the Clarets were crowned Kings of England|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed23/manchester_city_v_burnley__the_championship_2nd_may_1960_27806/index.shtml|title=Manchester City v Burnley – The Championship, 2nd May 1960 – Clarets Mad|last=|first=|date=|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had been in contention all season, Burnley had never led the table until this last match was played out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedaisycutter.co.uk/2013/08/the-forgotten-giants-of-turf-moor/|title=The Forgotten Giants of Turf Moor – The Daisy Cutter|date=9 August 2013|work=The Daisy Cutter|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potts had only used eighteen players throughout the whole season, as [[John Connelly (footballer)|John Connelly]] became Burnley's top scorer with 20 goals.&lt;ref name="FootballTimes" /&gt; The Lancastrians' title-winning squad costed just £13,000 in transfer fees too — £8,000 on McIlroy in 1950 and £5,000 on left-back [[Alex Elder]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good" /&gt; The other players of the squad each came from the Burnley youth academy.&lt;ref name="Never Had it So Good" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gameofthepeople" /&gt; After the season finished, Burnley went to the United States to participate in the inaugural international football tournament in North America, the [[International Soccer League]].&lt;ref name=sportsworld&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/david-and-goliath-and-burnley/|title=David and Goliath and Burnley|date=14 October 2014|work=NBC SportsWorld|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley finished the [[1961–62 in English football|1961–62]] season as runners-up (after only winning two of the last thirteen league matches)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/tab/matches/season/1962/|title=Burnley match record: 1962|website=www.11v11.com|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to newly promoted [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and had a run to the [[1962 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], where a [[Jimmy Robson]] goal, the 100th FA Cup Final goal at Wembley,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2015/jan/05/jimmy-robson-burnley-tottenham-hotspur-preview|title=Robson recalls historic Cup Final goal and Spurs rivalry|last=Association|first=The Football|publisher=The Football Association|access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was their only reply to 3 goals from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]].

{{Main|List of Burnley F.C. internationals}}

Burnley had, due to their success, several players with international caps in this period, including, for [[England national football team|England]] [[Ray Pointer]] (3 caps), [[Colin McDonald (footballer, born 1930)|Colin McDonald]] (8 caps), and John Connelly (20 caps), a member of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads|1966 World Cup squad]], for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] Jimmy McIlroy (55 caps) and for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] [[Adam Blacklaw]] (3 caps).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/may/international-honours-board-update/|title=International Honours Board Update|last=|first=|date=26 May 2017|work=Burnley Football Club|access-date=16 August 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, although far from a two-man team, the controversial departure of McIlroy to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and retirement of Adamson coincided with a decline in fortunes. Adamson reputedly turned down the England manager's post which then went to former Ipswich manager [[Alf Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/895440/fa-wanted-clarets-legend-jimmy-adamson-before-alf-ramsey/|title=FA wanted Clarets legend Jimmy Adamson before Alf Ramsey|date=9 November 2011|work=The Sun|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more damaging for Burnley was the impact of the abolition of the [[Maximum wage#Association football|maximum wage]] in 1961, meaning clubs from small towns, e.g. Burnley, could no longer compete financially with teams from bigger towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.efl.com/news/2016/january/fifty-five-years-to-the-day-20-maximum-wage-cap-abolished-by-football-league-clubs/|title=EFL Official Website Fifty-five years to the day: £20 maximum wage cap abolished by Football League clubs|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; They managed, however, to retain their First Division place throughout the decade finishing third in [[1965–66 in English football|1965–66]], with [[Willie Irvine]] becoming the league's [[List of English football first tier top scorers|top goal scorer]] that season,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html|title=English League Leading Goalscorers|first=|date=|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching the semi-final of the League Cup in [[1968–69 Football League Cup|1968–69]]. They had also reached the quarter-finals of the [[1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1966–67 Fairs Cup]], in which they were knocked out by German side [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/burnley-v-eintracht-frankfurt-18-april-1967-308145/|title=Burnley v Eintracht Frankfurt, 18 April 1967|work=11v11.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the decade was otherwise one of mid-table mediocrity, with Potts being replaced by Adamson as manager in 1970 after a 12-year spell.&lt;ref name=independant.co.uk&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-adamson-footballer-and-manager-who-led-burnley-to-their-greatest-successes-6259534.html|title=Jimmy Adamson: Footballer and manager who led Burnley to their greatest successes|last=|first=|date=10 November 2011|work=The Independent|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson was unable to halt the slide and relegation followed in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]] ending a long unbroken top flight spell of 24 consecutive seasons during which, more often than not, they had been in the upper reaches of the league table.

Burnley won the Second Division title in [[1972–73 in English football|1972–73]] with Adamson still in charge. As a result, they were invited to play in the [[1973 FA Charity Shield]] where they emerged as winners against the reigning holders of the shield, [[Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engsupcuphist.html|title=England – List of FA Charity/Community Shield Matches|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the First Division, led by elegant playmaker [[Martin Dobson]], the side managed to finish 6th in [[1973–74 in English football|1974]] as well as reaching another FA Cup semi-final; this time losing out to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/caught-in-time-burnley-return-to-the-first-division-1973-74-gqtvwgx3hmh|title=Caught in Time: Burnley return to the First Division, 1973 74|last=Struthers|first=Greg|date=2 May 2004|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season the club achieved 10th place, despite Dobson being sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] early in that season, but were victims of one of the great FA Cup shocks of all time when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], then in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], beat Burnley 1–0 at Turf Moor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/7704913.stm|title=Cup magic back in Wimbledon|date=7 November 2008|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relegation from the First Division in 1975–76 saw the end of Adamson's tenure as manager.&lt;ref name="independant.co.uk" /&gt;

Three nondescript seasons in the Second Division followed before relegation to the Third Division for the first time in [[1979–80 Burnley F.C. season|1979–80]]. Of 42 league games, Burnley could not manage a win in either their first or last 16.

Managerial changes continued to be made in an unsuccessful search for success; Miller was replaced by [[Frank Casper (footballer)|Frank Casper]] in early 1983, he by [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] before the 1983–84 season and Bond himself by [[John Benson (footballer, born 1942)|John Benson]] a season later.&lt;ref name=soccerbasemanagers&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=435&amp;teamTabs=managers|title=Burnley Manager History {{!}} Past &amp; Present {{!}} Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the fourth level of English football for the first time ever at the end of the [[1984–85 Burnley F.C. season|1984–85]] season. [[Martin Buchan]] (briefly) and then [[Tommy Cavanagh]] saw the side through the [[1985–86 Burnley F.C. season|1985–86]] season before Miller returned for the [[1986–87 Burnley F.C. season|1986–87]] season, the last match of which is known as '''The Orient Game''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name=PitchPublishing17&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Orient to the Emirates: The Plucky Rise of Burnley FC|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9781785313127|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1986–87 season, the Football League had decided to introduce automatic relegation and promotion between the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] and the [[National League (division)|Conference league]], the top tier of non-league football. Although, in retrospect, this has only served to blur the lines between professional and semi-professional leagues in England, at the time it was perceived that teams losing league status might never recover from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/24/so-youve-been-relegated-from-league-two-what-happens-next|title=So you've been relegated from League Two. What happens next? {{!}} Martin Belam|last=Belam|first=Martin|date=24 April 2017|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Burnley had a new local rival in [[Colne Dynamoes F.C.|Colne Dynamoes]] who were rapidly progressing through the English non-league system at the same time as the former champions of England were in the lowest level of the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/101-Non-League/4366-the-colne-dynamoes-debacle|title=When Saturday Comes – The Colne Dynamoes debacle|last=Whalley|first=Mike|website=www.wsc.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a disastrous season, which also saw a first round FA Cup 3–0 defeat at non-league [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]], Burnley went into the last match needing a win against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Orient]]. A 2–1 win, with goals from [[Neil Grewcock]] and [[Ian Britton (Scottish footballer)|Ian Britton]], was enough to keep Burnley in Division Four, although even that achievement still relied on a loss by [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in their last game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/sport/football/clarets/the-match-that-lasted-a-lifetime-1-1697160|title=The match that lasted a lifetime|website=www.burnleyexpress.net|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had Burnley been relegated, the club would have probably been dissolved.&lt;ref name=footballnetwork.net&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st103252.htm|title='The Orient Game'|work=TheLongside.co.uk|access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery (1987–2000)===
In May 1988, Burnley were back at Wembley; this time to play [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] in the final of the [[Football League Trophy]]. A capacity crowd of 80,000 people packed Wembley was a record for a match between two teams from English football's fourth tier, as Wolves won [[1988 Football League Trophy Final|2–0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4804537.Sherpa_final_a_turning_point_in_Burnley_s_history/|title=Sherpa final a turning point in Burnley's history|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1991–92 Burnley F.C. season|1991–92]], Burnley were champions in the last ever season of the Fourth Division before the league reorganisation. By winning the Fourth Division title, ''the Clarets'' became only the second club to have won all top four professional divisions of English football and the team is currently one of five clubs to have achieved this feat, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12038/10868826/martin-tylers-stats-most-own-goals-fewest-different-scorers-in-a-season|title=Martin Tyler's stats: Most own goals, fewest different scorers in a season|last=|first=|date=|work=Sky Sports|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993–94 Burnley F.C. season|Two years later]] they won the new Division Two play-offs and gained promotion to Division One under [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]].

[[Chris Waddle]] was manager in that season, but his departure and the appointment of [[Stan Ternent]] that summer saw the club start to make further progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/dec/29/newsstory.sport4|title=The Saturday Interview: Ternent close to matching the great Clarets|last=Walker|first=Michael|date=29 December 2001|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1999–2000 Burnley F.C. season|1999–2000]] they finished Division Two runners-up and gained promotion back to the second tier.

Burnley immediately made an impact, as during the [[2000–01 Burnley F.C. season|2000–01]] and [[2001–02 Burnley F.C. season|2001–02]] seasons, they emerged as serious contenders for a promotion play-off place. By [[2002–03 Burnley F.C. season|2002–03]], the side's form had declined despite a good FA Cup run, where they reached the quarter-finals. This was repeated the [[2003–04 Burnley F.C. season|following season]] and in June 2004, Ternent's six years as manager came to an end, narrowly avoiding relegation in his last season. [[Steve Cotterill]] was then appointed as manager of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/03/newsstory.burnley|title=Cotterill lands Burnley job|last=Association|first=Press|date=3 June 2004|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotterill's first year in charge produced two notable cup runs, knocking out [[Premier League]] clubs [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and a 13th-place finish in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. He was not able to improve on this the following season, as Burnley finished 17th.

Burnley made a good start to the [[2006–07 Burnley F.C. season|2006–07]] campaign, but their form tailed away badly shortly before Christmas, leaving them threatened by relegation. The squad set a club record for consecutive league games without a win, with their game against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] being the 18th one of the season (19 including a cup game), meaning they had gone one fixture further than the 17 league game streak of the 1889–90 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/burnley_fc/news/11306817.Ade_Akinbiyi__Coyle_was_able_to_lift_everyone_when_he_took_the_Clarets_up/|title=Ade Akinbiyi: Coyle was able to lift everyone when he took the Clarets up|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of draws and losses was finally broken in April, as Burnley beat [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] 4–0 at Turf Moor. After that, a short run of good form in the final weeks of the competition saw Burnley finish comfortably above the relegation places, ensuring that they remained in the Championship.

The following season Burnley's poor early-season results led to the departure of manager Steve Cotterill in November 2007. His replacement was [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] manager [[Owen Coyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/22/newsstory.burnley|title=Burnley announce appointment of Owen Coyle as their new manager|last=|first=|date=22 November 2007|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coyle subsequently led the team to a total of 62 points for the [[2007–08 Burnley F.C. season|2007–08]] season, their largest total for eight years. Coyle's [[2008–09 Burnley F.C. season|first full season]] in charge ended with ''the Clarets''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' highest league finish since 1976, fifth in the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportige.com/wolves-birmingham-burnley/|title=Wolves, Birmingham and Burnley – Club Profiles {{!}} Sportige|website=sportige.com|language=en-US|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was enough to qualify the club for the Championship play-offs. Burnley beat [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 3–0 on aggregate in the semi-final, and the team went on to beat [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1–0 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium]], promoting Burnley to the [[Premier League]], a return to the top flight after 33 years. [[Wade Elliott]] scored the vital goal in a match known as "''The £50,000,000 final''", due to the increased revenues available to Premiership clubs after the agreement of substantially higher TV rights payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8060970.stm|title=Burnley 1–0 Sheff Utd |date=25 September 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Burnley reached the semi-final of the League Cup for the first time in over 25 years, after beating local clubs [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and London-based clubs [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/03/burnley-arsenal-premier-league|title=Carling Cup: Arsene Wenger fumes as Burnley turf out Arsenal|last=Cross|first=Jeremy|date=3 December 2008|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-finals they faced another London club and an old foe, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and Burnley lost the first leg 4–1.

[[File:Sean Dyche.jpg|thumb|175px|Manager Sean Dyche, who was appointed in October 2012.]]
Before the start of the [[2013–14 Burnley F.C. season|2013–14]] season, Burnley were tipped as one of the relegation candidates, as Dyche had to work with a tight budget and a small squad, and they had lost top goal scorer [[Charlie Austin]] to Championship rivals [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11708/11098322/sean-dyches-five-years-at-burnley|title=Sean Dyche's five years at Burnley|last=|first=|date=|work=Sky Sports|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They finished, however, second and were automatically promoted back to the Premier League in Dyche's first full season in charge, as the new strike partnership of [[Danny Ings]] (who also won the [[EFL Awards|''Championship Player of the Year'' award]]) and [[Sam Vokes]] had 41 league goals between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/sport/football/clarets/danny-ings-agrees-move-to-liverpool-1-7298163|title=Danny Ings agrees move to Liverpool|last=|first=|date=|work=Burnley Express|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dyche only used 23 players throughout the season, which was the joint-lowest in the division, and he only paid a transfer fee for one player since his appointment — £400,000 on striker [[Ashley Barnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/27016258|title=Burnley 2–0 Wigan Athletic|last=|first=|date=21 April 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; But yet again, their stay in the Premier League only lasted a single season as they finished [[2014–15 Burnley F.C. season|19th out of 20]] clubs and were subsequently relegated. Burnley went yet one better than their previous time in the Championship and won the division in [[2015–16 Burnley F.C. season|2015–16]], equaling their club record of 93 points of 2013–14, ending the season with a run of 23 league games undefeated.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Orient to the Emirates: The Plucky Rise of Burnley FC|last=Quelch|first=Tim|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9781785313127|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyche used just 25 players during the season this time, and new signing [[Andre Gray]] finished as the league's [[EFL Championship#Top scorers|top goal scorer]] with 25 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5159769/Burnley-Sean-Dyche-praises-Watford-striker-Andre-Gray.html|title=Sean Dyche praises Andre Gray ahead of Turf Moor return|work=Mail Online|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a combination of excellent home form with poor away results, Burnley finished the [[2016–17 Burnley F.C. season|2016–17]] season in 16th place, six points above the relegation zone, and were thus ensured to play consecutive seasons in the top flight for the first time since [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/15285311.Burnley__39_s_safety_is_confirmed_as_Hull_City_lose_at_Crystal_Palace/|title=Burnley's safety is confirmed as Hull City lose at Crystal Palace|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2017–18 Burnley F.C. season|following season]] started off with an away win to defending champions Chelsea (3–2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40835426|title=Chelsea 2–3 Burnley|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC Sport|access-date=|publication-date=12 August 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a start signal for a reversed away form, as Burnley finished the season with more points collected on the road than at home. Moreover, Burnley's home form continued to be strong too, drawing against eventual inexpugnable league champions and record breakers [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (1–1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42842351|title=Burnley 1–1 Manchester City|last=|first=|date=3 February 2018|work=BBC Sport|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnley ultimately secured an unexpected 7th place at the end of the season, their highest league finish since [[1973–74 Football League|1973–74]], and thus qualified for the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League]], meaning they qualified for a competitive European competition for the first time in 51 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44018738|title=Burnley secure European football for first time in 51 years|date=5 May 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their European tour, however, already ended in August, as they crashed out in the play-offs against Greek side [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], after they had eliminated Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Turkish side [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.|İstanbul Başakşehir]] in the previous rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45350947|title=Burnley 1–1 Olympiakos (2–4 on agg)|last=|first=|date=30 August 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=31 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has been represented by numerous high-profile players over the years, most notably [[Jimmy McIlroy]] and [[Jimmy Adamson]], the latter earning the [[FWA Footballer of the Year|''Footballer of the Year'']] award in [[1961–62 in English football|1962]], the first and to date only time a Burnley player has won this award.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[1965–66 Football League|Four years later]], Burnley youth graduate [[Willie Irvine]] became the First Division [[List of English football first tier top scorers|top goal scorer]], also an unique feat in the club's history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Welshman [[Leighton James]] owns a club record too, as he is the only Burnley player to have been included in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] while playing in the first tier, when he was selected as a member of the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official P.F.A.

The [[English Football Hall of Fame]], which is housed at the [[National Football Museum]], in [[Manchester]], currently contains five former Burnley players: [[Tommy Lawton]], Jimmy McIlroy, and [[Mike Summerbee]], [[Ian Wright]] and [[Paul Gascoigne]]; the latter three had, however, relatively short spells at ''the Clarets'' and were at the end of their playing careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/explore-the-museum/hall-of-fame/about-the-hall-of-fame/|title=About the Football Hall Of Fame|last=|first=|date=|work=National Football Museum|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these five players, Gascoigne, Lawton and McIlroy, also featured in a list entitled "The [[Football League 100 Legends|''Football League 100 Legends'']]", as Burnley's only representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/144986.stm|title=Legends list in full|last=|first=|date=|website=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list was released by the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of league football. Jimmy McIlroy was voted as ''[[PFA Fans' Favourites|PFA Fans' Favourite]]'' by Burnley fans in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2328937/Best-footballers-Shearer-a-hero-on-two-fronts.html|title=Best footballers: Shearer a hero on two fronts|last=Smith|first=Martin|date=19 December 2007|work=The Telegraph|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 31 "''Clarets' legends''" from different eras in the club's history were picked by the fans of Burnley via an online vote. The chosen players had an artwork depicting them hung up beside the turnstiles of Turf Moor. It was a cooperation between the club and members of the Burnley [[Supporters' groups|supporters' clubs]], to "''improve the appearance of the ground and provide a vivid history of some of the greatest players to wear a claret and blue shirt''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15056386.Greatest_Burnley_FC_players_honoured_at_Turf_Moor/|title=Greatest Burnley FC players honoured at Turf Moor|last=|first=|date=|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Clarets''' first international, [[John Yates (footballer, born 1861)|John Yates]], had to be omitted because no suitable image of him could be found, therefore giving his spot to [[George Halley]].

{{Updated|20 April 2018}}

Chairman Mike Garlick holds 49.24% of outstanding shares of Burnley F.C. and Member of the [[Board of Directors]] John Banaszkiewicz another 28.2%. The other five Members of the Board hold, between them, a total of 16.36%. The total holding of shares by all Board members amounts to 93.8%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/club/contact/ Board of Directors], Burnley FC&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley is one of the few clubs in the top two tiers who are British-owned. Every director at the club is locally born, a ''Claret'' supporter and none of them are getting paid. As of 2018–19, the club is debt-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4975022/Brendan-Flood-reveals-secrets-Burnley-s-success.html|title=Burnley's secret and a choppy helicopter ride with Neville and Giggs|last=|first=|date=|work=Mail Online|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Kits, colours and crest ==

=== Kits and colours ===
In the early years, various designs and colours were used by Burnley. Throughout their first eight years these were various permutations of blue and white. After three years of claret and amber stripes with black shorts, for much of the 1890s a combination of black with amber stripes was used, although the club wore a shirt with pink and white stripes during the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95]] season. Between 1897 and 1900 the club used a plain red shirt and from 1900 until 1910 the club changed to an all green shirt with white shorts. In 1910 the club changed their colours to claret and sky blue, the colours that they have now had for the majority of their history, save for a spell in white shirts and black shorts during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The adoption of the claret and sky blue colour combination were a homage to league champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], who wore those colours. The Burnley committee and manager [[John Haworth]] believed it might bring a change of fortune.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Burnley's away kit for the [[2006–07 Burnley F.C. season|2006–07]] season, a yellow shirt with claret bar, yellow shorts and yellow socks, won the ''Best Kit Design'' award at the [[EFL Awards|Football League Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/1238010.Clarets_win_kit_award/|title=Clarets win kit award|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2007–08 Burnley F.C. season|following season]], a new home kit was released, echoing the 1950s shirt; all claret with a blue v-neck and rims on the end of the arms which sport the word '''Burnley''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. It featured gold trim and a new gold logo for the club's 125th anniversary. For the Championship match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 24 November 2007, Burnley wore a commemorative 125th anniversary shirt based on their first kit; blue and white stripes with black trim/shorts and white socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2007-2008/championship.html|title=The Championship 2007–2008 – Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2009–10 Burnley F.C. season|2009–10]] season, the club wore a kit similar to the kit worn when Burnley won the old First Division title (i.e. what is now the Premier League title) in [[1959–60 Burnley F.C. season|1959–60]], to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that achievement.

Since 2010, Burnley's kits have been manufactured by [[Puma (brand)|Puma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/business/4864368.Burnley_sign_new_Puma_kit_deal/|title=Burnley sign new Puma kit deal|last=|first=|date=21 January 2010|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous manufacturers include [[Umbro]] (1975–81), Spall (1981–87, 1988–89), En-s (1987–88), Ellgren (1989–91), Ribero (1991–93), [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] (1993–96), [[Adidas]] (1996–99), Super League (1999–2002), TFG Sports (2002–05), and [[Erreà]] (2005–10).&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The clubs shirts are currently sponsored by LaBa360.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soccerex.com/insight/articles/2018/burnley-announce-record-breaking-shirt-sponsor-deal|title=Burnley announce ‘record-breaking’ shirt sponsor deal|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=24 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous shirt sponsors include POCO (1982–83), [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB]] (1983–84), [[Multipart Solutions|Multipart]] (1984–88), [[Endsleigh Insurance|Endsleigh]] (1988–98), P3 Computers (1998–2000), Lanway (2001–04), Hunters (2004–07), [[Holland's Pies|Holland's]] (2007–09), Cooke (2009–10), Fun88 (2010–12, 2014–15), Premier Range (2012–14), [[Oak Furniture Land]] (2015–16), and [[Dafabet]] (2016–18).&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt;

=== Crest ===
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|The Royal Arms]]
''The Clarets''' first recorded usage of a crest was on 17 December 1887, when they wore the [[Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales' coat of arms]] on their shirt.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; The Prince of Wales visited Turf Moor a year before when Burnley was playing Bolton Wanderers, which was the first ever visit by a member of the [[British royal family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Fiszman, Marc; Peters, Mark (2005). Kick Off Championship 2005–06. Sidan Press. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Burnley were presented a set of white jerseys featuring a blue sash and embellished with the Prince of Wales' coat of arms to commemorate the visit, making ''the Clarets'' the first ever club to have the right to wear it on their shirts.&lt;ref name=claretsmad.co.uk&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed93/ask_clarets_mad_answers_7_108144/index.shtml|title=Ask Clarets Mad Answers 7 – Clarets Mad|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club would regularly wear the royal crest until the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95]] season. Twenty years later, when Burnley played the [[1914 FA Cup Final]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was in attendance, the Royal Arms featured once again on the ''claret and blue'' shirts.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; 

A forerunner of the club's current badge was first recorded in 1935. 25 years later, when Burnley won the league title for a second time, they were allowed to wear the town's crest of the period on their shirts.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/feat/ed93/ask_clarets_mad_answers_7_108144/index.shtml|title=Ask Clarets Mad Answers 7 – Clarets Mad|last=LTD|first=Digital Sports Group|website=www.clarets-mad.co.uk|language=en|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town's crest was worn until the [[1969–70 Football League|1969–70]] season, when it was replaced with a simple "''BFC''". Six years later, the initials were lettered with gold. Four seasons after that, the club used a new designed badge based on the town's crest, before returning to a horizontal version of the "''BFC''" initials in 1983, which were lettered in white this time.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; In the [[1987–88 Burnley F.C. season|1987–88]] season they returned to their former, new designed crest.

The latest major change to the club crest came in the [[2009–10 Burnley F.C. season|2009–10]] season. To mark Burnley's first ever season in the [[Premier League]], since the rebranding of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1992, and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club's 1959–60 First Division league title win, Burnley decided to return to the crest used in that title winning season.&lt;ref name="historicalkits" /&gt; [[2010–11 Burnley F.C. season|The following season]], the town's Latin motto "''Pretiumque Et Causa Laboris''" (English translation: "''The prize and the cause of our labour''") was replaced with the inscription "''Burnley Football Club''".&lt;ref name=sbnation&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/1/16/7557207/burnley-badge-premier-league|title=Burnley's badge is the best in the Premier League|work=SBNation.com|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley's current badge is based on the town's crest and many components of the badge — depicting cotton, history, industry, royalty — have their origins in the history of the club, the town [[Burnley]] and surrounding areas and the components thus refer to them.&lt;ref name=sbnation /&gt;

The club's mascot is Dyche the Dick Dressed in a bee suit, he wears the Burnley home kit with shirt number 1882 and is popular with the Burnley fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10209230.Video__Film_shows_day_in_the_life_of_Clarets_mascot_Bertie_Bee/|title=Video: Film shows day in the life of Clarets mascot Bertie Bee|last=|first=|date=|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known nationwide for rugby tackling a streaker on the pitch at Turf Moor who had evaded the stewards during a match against local rivals Preston in 2002, and appeared on the BBC Television sporting panel show [[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|''They Think It's All Over'']] after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.burnleyexpress.net/news/offbeat/video-bertie-bee-how-rugby-tackling-a-streaker-changed-my-career-1-3180956|title=VIDEO: Bertie Bee – how rugby tackling a streaker changed my career|website=www.burnleyexpress.net|language=en|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley have played their home games at Turf Moor since 1883, after playing at its original ground at ''Calder Vale'' for less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/|title=Burnley football club overview|last=|first=|date=|website=www.11v11.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballhistory.org/club/burnley.html|title=Burnley FC|last=|first=|date=|website=www.footballhistory.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turf Moor is the longest continuously used ground of any of the 49 teams which have played in the Premier League and the second oldest continually used site for professional league football in the world, behind [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]]'s [[Deepdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4763572.Burnley_chairman__I_d_love_to_buy_back_the_Turf_Moor/|title=Burnley chairman: I'd love to buy back the Turf Moor|last=|first=|date=27 November 2009|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is located on [[Harry Potts]] Way, named in honour of the club's longest serving manager.

In October 1886, Turf Moor welcomed the first-ever visit by a member of the [[Royal family|Royal Family]] to a first-class association football match at a senior ground, when [[Queen Victoria]]'s grandson, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], was in attendance for a match between Burnley and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/december/the-story-of-the-dr-dean-trophy/|title=The Story Of The Dr Dean Trophy|last=Simpson|first=Ray|date=5 December 2017|work=Burnley Football Club|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, the first Football League match at Turf Moor was an encounter against the same opposition, Bolton, with Burnley emerging as 4–1 winners, [[Fred Poland]] scoring the first competitive league goal at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Football League: The First Season 1888/89|last=Metcalf|first=Mark|publisher=Amberley Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1445618814|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1921–22 FA Cup|1922]], the ground hosted its only [[FA Cup semi-finals|FA Cup semi-final]] to date, between [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], and five years later it hosted its only senior international match, between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] for the [[British Home Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=158|title=England 1–2 Wales, British Home Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=englandstats.com|language=en-UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turf Moor site was first used for sport in 1833, when [[Burnley Cricket Club]] was established. Fifty years later, they invited Burnley Football Club to move from their original premises at ''Calder Vale'' to a pitch adjacent to the cricket field.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burden |first1=Brian |last2=Morse |first2=Blair |title=The Sports Tourists' Guide to the English Premier League |publisher=BookBaby |year=2018 |isbn=978-1543919554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885.&lt;ref name=footballstadiumsweb&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.football-stadiums.co.uk/grounds/england/turf-moor/|title=Turf Moor|date=|work=Football Stadiums|access-date=16 June 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now consists of 4 stands, the James Hargreaves Stand (''The Longside''), the [[Jimmy McIlroy]] Stand (''Bee Hole End''), the Bob Lord Stand and the Ladbrokes Stand (''The Cricket Field Stand'') for home and away fans. The current capacity is 21,944 all-seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/43/Burnley/stadium|title=Turf Moor Burnley FC, Info &amp; Map {{!}} Premier League|website=www.premierleague.com|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-World War I crowds in the stadium averaged in the 30,000–40,000 range with the record attendance set in 1924 against Huddersfield Town in a FA Cup match when 54,755 attended the match.&lt;ref name=BurnleypremiumTV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10413~1031447,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309101845/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10413~1031447,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 March 2008|title=The Turf Moor Story {{!}} Burnley {{!}} Club {{!}} History {{!}} History|date=9 March 2008|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 23 February 1960, in a fifth round FA Cup replay against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], there was an official reported attendance of 52,850 at the Turf. Some of the gates were, however, broken down and many uncounted fans poured into the ground. Many supporters were also locked out, and the road from Bradford over the Moss at [[Colne]] had to be closed to traffic.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st112457.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1974, ''The Turf'' had a slight slope in the field, when chairman Bob Lord made a resolution to relay the pitch and to remove the slope.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when ''The Longside'' and ''Bee Hole End'' terraces were replaced by all-seater stands as a result of the [[Taylor Report]], reducing the capacity in the process.&lt;ref name=footballstadiumsweb /&gt;

In 2008, plans were made to extend the stadium to a capacity of around 28,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/burnley/5386898/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-Burnley.html|title=10 things you probably didn't know about Burnley|last=Smith|first=Rory|date=26 May 2009|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity increase would include a second tier attached to the Bob Lord stand, along with a complete re-development of the stand. In addition, a new stand was planned to replace the Cricket Field Stand, which would also hold a cricket pavilion and hotel. In late 2008, these plans were put on hold as general economic conditions worsened in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pitchcare.com/news-media/a-drop-of-claret.html|title=A Drop of Claret {{!}} Pitchcare|website=www.pitchcare.com|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of 2017, Burnley finalised plans to develop two corners of the stadium (between the Jimmy McIlroy stand and both the James Hargreaves and Bob Lord stands) to provide better facilities for disabled supporters to meet the ''Accessible Stadium Guide'' (ASG) regulations.&lt;ref name=December2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/december/disabled-to-get-new-facilities-in-turf-moor-facelift/|title=Burnley Football Club Disabled Fans To Get New Facilities In Turf Moor Facelift|access-date=25 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans took the spending on infrastructure at the club to around £20m in two years, including a bigger club shop and ticket office at the stadium, and a major uplift to their training centre.

At the same time, however, the club concluded that "there will be no other ground developments to increase the overall capacity of Turf Moor in the short-term, unless an increase in demand for seats forces a re-think."&lt;ref name=December2017 /&gt;

When falling down to the lower leagues and the simultaneously growing presence of [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|hooliganism in English football]] in the 1980s, a [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firm]] linked to Burnley was established, called the "''[[Suicide Squad (hooligan firm)|Suicide Squad]]"'', which became infamous for violently clashing with many other firms and fans in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suicide Squad: The Inside Story of a Football Firm|last=Porter|first=Andrew|publisher=Milo Books|year=2005|isbn=9781903854464|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also featured in the television documentary series ''[[The Real Football Factories]]'' presented by [[Danny Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/318191/thugs-jailed-over-football-gang-fight/|title=Thugs jailed over football gang fight|date=19 January 2011|work=The Sun|access-date=4 February 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squad officially disbanded in 2009 after a high-profile incident with supporters of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], in which afterwards twelve members of the ''Suicide Squad'' were sentenced to jail for a total of 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/8797259.Burnley__Suicide_Squad__hooligans_jailed_for_32_years/|title=Burnley 'Suicide Squad' hooligans jailed for 32 years|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two clubs are separated by fourteen miles (22.5 kilometres) and besides the geographical proximity, the clubs have a long-standing history of fierce rivalry too; their first competitive clash being a Football League match in 1888, in the [[1888–89 Football League|inaugural season]] of the competition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Blackburn%20Rovers/|title=Burnley football club: record v Blackburn Rovers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.11v11.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years earlier, however, they had met for the first time, although in an alleged ''pre-league friendly'', with considerable pride at stake.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/4668181.History_of_the_Blackburn_Rovers_v_Burnley_derby__part_one/|title=History of the Blackburn Rovers v Burnley derby: part one|last=|first=|date=|website=Lancashire Telegraph|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the ''pre-league friendlies'', there have been 113 matches played between both, with Burnley having the slightly better head-to-head record of the two teams, ''the Clarets'' winning 48 games and Blackburn 45.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Burnley's closest geographic rival is actually [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] but, as they have never competed at the same level (although defunct club [[Accrington F.C.|Accrington]] did), there is no rivalry between both. 

Other rivalries exist with local clubs [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref name="wordpress.com" /&gt; Burnley have regularly played them in the league and cup competitions and the encounter between Burnley and Preston is, as of 2018–19, the most frequently played match in both club's histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/burnley/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Preston%20North%20End/|title=Burnley football club: record v Preston North End|last=|first=|date=|website=www.11v11.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Clarets'' also contested heated matches with [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the 1990s, when they were playing in the lower leagues, although feelings of animosity were mainly one-sided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=3 February 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203154108/http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2004|dead-url=yes|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnley will be the only club from the ceremonial county of [[Lancashire]] in the top flight during the [[2018–19 Burnley F.C. season|2018–19]] season, as they were in the previous two seasons. Their most local rivals will be West Yorkshire side [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], who are based 25 miles (40 kilometres) away from Turf Moor.

Founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C., the club changed its name to Cardiff City in 1908 and entered the [[Southern Football League]] in 1910 before joining the [[English Football League]] in 1920. The team's longest period in the top tier of English football came between 1921 and 1929. Since then, they have spent a total of nine seasons in the top flight, the most recent being in the current [[2018–19 Premier League|2018–19 Premier League season]].

==History==
{{main article|History of Cardiff City F.C.}}

===Early years (1899–1920)===
Following a meeting at the home of [[Lithography|lithographic]] artist [[Bartley Wilson]] in Cardiff,&lt;ref name="Hayes208"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2006|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; the club was founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C. as a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club together and in shape during the winter months.&lt;ref name="obscure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/obscure-story-cardiff-citys-blue-2030463 |title=The obscure story of Cardiff City's blue kit and nickname |website=WalesOnline |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |first=Steve |last=Tucker |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822012209/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/obscure-story-cardiff-citys-blue-2030463 |archive-date=22 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes5"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first season, they played [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] against local sides at their [[Sophia Gardens]] ground. In 1900 they joined the Cardiff &amp; District League for their first competitive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff city status in 1905, the club put in a request to the [[South Wales and Monmouthshire Football Association]] to change their name to Cardiff City.&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; The request was turned down as they were deemed not to be  playing at a high enough level. To enhance their standing, the team arranged to join the South Wales Amateur League in 1907. The following year they were granted permission to change the name of the club to Cardiff City.&lt;ref name="Shepherd4"&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="99–20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/1899-1920-724134.aspx |title=1899–1920 Foundations &amp; the Early Years |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |first=Richard |last=Shepherd |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622141513/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk//news/article/1899-1920-724134.aspx |archive-date=22 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although growing in stature, the club was forced to turn down the opportunity to join the newly formed Second Division of the [[Southern Football League]] due to a lack of facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground. Over the next two years, Cardiff played friendlies against some of Britain's top professional sides, including [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. The matches were played at various grounds in Cardiff and nearby towns so as to gauge the level of public interest in the team.&lt;ref name="grandin12"&gt;{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club eventually secured land to build their own stadium, [[Ninian Park]], which was completed in 1910. The club turned professional the same year. They made their first signing the following year with the acquisition of [[Jack Evans (Welsh footballer)|Jack Evans]] from fellow Welsh side Cwmparc.&lt;ref name="99–20"/&gt;

With the new grounds in place, Cardiff joined the Southern Football League Second Division&lt;ref name="FCHD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fchd.info/CARDIFFC.HTM |title=Cardiff City |publisher=Football Club History Database |accessdate=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424201828/http://www.fchd.info/CARDIFFC.HTM |archive-date=24 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed their first manager, [[Davy McDougall]], who became [[player-manager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing Manager Appointed|newspaper=Evening Express|page=4|date=14 September 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to finish in fourth place in their first year in the league. The board decided to replace McDougall with [[Fred Stewart (football manager)|Fred Stewart]], who had previous managerial experience with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].&lt;ref name="Hayes208"/&gt; He set about adopting a more professional approach, signing several players with Football League experience, including brothers [[John Burton (footballer, born 1885)|John]] and [[George Burton (footballer)|George Burton]] and [[Billy Hardy (footballer)|Billy Hardy]]. Stewart led the team to promotion in his second season by winning the Second Division title. They remained in the First Division for the next decade, and finished in the top four on two occasions.&lt;ref name="99–20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2002|pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Cardiff has a large catchment area from which to draw its supporter base. With only two professional teams (Swansea City and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]]) sharing the South Wales region, the nearest being around {{convert|40|mi|abbr=off}} away, the club enjoys considerable support from both the city of Cardiff and the surrounding [[South Wales Valleys]].&lt;ref name="Identity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writenow.ac.uk/oldsite/QRSS/vol_1/JQRSS_6_Rogers%20and%20Rookwood%2057-68.pdf |title=Cardiff City Football Club as a Vehicle to Promote Welsh National Identity |last1=Rogers |first1=Guy |last2=Rookwood |first2=Joel |work=Journal of Qualitative Research in Sports Studies |year=2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=22 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809125805/http://www.writenow.ac.uk/oldsite/QRSS/vol_1/JQRSS_6_Rogers%20and%20Rookwood%2057-68.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Welsh club playing in the English football league system, national identity is believed to be a major factor in fan support, and some of the club's matches are considered to be Welsh cross-border rivalries with England.&lt;ref name="Identity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-cardiff-city-stadium-factor-15047068 |title=Why the fans and Cardiff City Stadium factor are the Bluebirds' biggest Premier League weapon |work=WalesOnline |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |last=Abbandonato |first=Paul |date=19 August 2018 |accessdate=23 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224023851/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-cardiff-city-stadium-factor-15047068 |archive-date=24 December 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, as the club struggled in the lower divisions of English football, crowds dropped to an average of 3,000 per match. An increase in the club's fortunes saw a steady improvement in crowd numbers. The average attendance at home fixtures rose from 3,594 to 12,522 in a five-year spell between 1997 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shepherd|2007|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion to the second tier in 2003 brought further increases in numbers. The opening of the Cardiff City Stadium led to average attendances reaching 20,000 fans, culminating with a high of 27,429 in the Premier League during the [[2013–14 Cardiff City F.C. season|2013–14 season]].&lt;ref name="dwindle"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34650363 |title=Cardiff City: Why have crowds dwindled despite steady results? |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=23 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224030410/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34650363 |archive-date=24 December 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increase, the club is often regarded as attracting a lower number of spectators than similarly placed teams.

Known as the [[South Wales derby]], Cardiff City's most significant rivalry is with nearby neighbours [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], and over 100 games have been played in all competitions between the sides. Swansea's first ever competitive fixture following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League.&lt;ref name="Hayes5"/&gt; The rivalry had been relatively friendly until the 1970s and 1980s. Economic issues, such as the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|UK miners' strike]], rivalry between the two cities and an increase in [[football hooliganism]] led to numerous violent clashes between fans at the fixtures. One fixture in 1993 was dubbed "The Battle of Ninian Park" for its particularly severe violence and resulted in away fans being banned from attending any fixtures between the sides for four years.&lt;ref name="guardderby"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/01/cardiff-city-swansea-premier-league-hatred |title=Cardiff and Swansea make Premier League history but hatred continues |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=James |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324052025/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/01/cardiff-city-swansea-premier-league-hatred |archive-date=24 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="derby"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cardiff-v-swansea-history-and-hurt-behind-the-squabble-for-welsh-rule-8919306.html |title=Cardiff v Swansea: History and hurt behind the squabble for Welsh rule |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |first=Ian |last=Herbert |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106085313/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cardiff-v-swansea-history-and-hurt-behind-the-squabble-for-welsh-rule-8919306.html |archive-date=6 January 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/thats-worst-violence-ever-seen-6772249 |title='The worst violence I have ever seen anywhere in my life': Football intelligence officer recalls South Wales derby clash |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=David |last=Owens |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308061942/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/thats-worst-violence-ever-seen-6772249 |archive-date=8 March 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff player [[Jason Perry (footballer)|Jason Perry]] described the period as "the dark, dark days of the derby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/cardiff-city/10422282/How-the-once-friendly-rivalry-between-Cardiff-City-and-Swansea-City-turned-poisonous.html |title=How the once-friendly rivalry between Cardiff City and Swansea City turned poisonous |newspaper=The Telegraph |first=Graham |last=Clutton |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819195106/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/cardiff-city/10422282/How-the-once-friendly-rivalry-between-Cardiff-City-and-Swansea-City-turned-poisonous.html |archive-date=19 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ban was dropped, "bubble trips" were introduced for away fans who can only attend fixtures in police escorted-convoys to travel to and from the stadium.&lt;ref name="guardderby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt;

Further political divide between the two cities was caused by the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|Welsh devolution referendum in 1997]] when Cardiff was chosen as the site for the newly created [[Senedd]], despite the majority of the city voting against devolution.&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt; Swansea, which largely voted in favour of devolution, received funding for a [[Wales National Pool|national swimming pool]] instead.&lt;ref name="derby"/&gt; [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]], who played for both sides, commented, "I think Cardiff has always been perceived [...] to receive whatever funding is going around. It seems to me that everything gets channelled in that direction".&lt;ref name="guardderby"/&gt; 
Further afield, the club has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the [[Severnside derby]], and to a lesser extent, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh neighbours Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each other since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 Football League games against each other. A survey by [[Football Fans Census]] in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] matching Newport in third.&lt;ref name="Rivalry Uncovered!"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rivalry uncovered! |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |publisher=[[Football Fans Census]] |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020074918/http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff's first ground was at Sophia Gardens recreational park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Recreation_Field.html |title=From Sophia to SWALEC |publisher=cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109214203/http://www.cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Recreation_Field.html |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed.&lt;ref name="grandin12"/&gt; The original intention was to name the ground Sloper Park,&lt;ref name="Hayes7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ninian Park was chosen instead after [[Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart]], who was a driving force behind the ground's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7976000/7976628.stm |title=Fans bid farewell to Ninian Park |publisher=BBC News |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812174739/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7976000/7976628.stm |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]];&lt;ref name="Shepherd4"/&gt; Lord Crichton-Stuart ceremoniously kicked off the game.&lt;ref name="Hayes7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was built with one stand. A second, which replaced an earth embankment and could hold 18,000 people, was opened in 1928. It hosted its first international match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Hayes7"/&gt; Towards the end of its lifespan, the ground was replaced for international fixtures by [[Cardiff Arms Park]] as doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1652214,00.html |title=Bluebirds average attendances |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214113648/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~1652214%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000, meant that the record stood until the grounds' closure. In its final years of use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities to keep the remaining standing areas of the ground open beyond the three-year period given to clubs at Championship level or above to remove them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-borley-wanted-standing-areas-2093853 |title=Steve Borley wanted standing areas at Cardiff City Stadium |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Terry |last=Phillips |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142947/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-borley-wanted-standing-areas-2093853 |archive-date=9 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/latest-news/view/keep-scunthorpe-standing.php?id=added%7Cdesc%7C290%7C |title=Keep Scunthorpe Standing |publisher=[[Football Supporters' Federation]] |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City Stadium===

[[File:Cardiff City Stadium Pitch.jpg|thumb|Cardiff City Stadium pitch in 2010]]
In June 2009, the club completed construction of a 26,828-seat stadium on the site of the now-demolished old [[Cardiff Athletics Stadium]] at a cost of £48&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="NewGround"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bluebirds-ground-named-the-cardiff-2119345 |title=Bluebirds ground named 'The Cardiff City Stadium' |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812173333/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bluebirds-ground-named-the-cardiff-2119345 |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-unveil-plans-38000-capacity-4330428 |title=Cardiff City unveil plans for 38,000-capacity stadium expansion |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Simon |last=Gaskell |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142712/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-unveil-plans-38000-capacity-4330428 |archive-date=9 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was named the "Cardiff City Stadium". Three of the four stands would keep the names used at Ninian Park—the Grange End, the Canton Stand and the Grandstand—and the fourth stand would be called the Ninian Stand.&lt;ref name="NewGround"/&gt; The ground's naming rights were expected to be sold, with the club hoping to generate up to £9&amp;nbsp;million income;  however they remain unsold.&lt;ref name="NewGround"/&gt; Although a pre-season friendly against [[Chasetown F.C.|Chasetown]] was played at the ground with limited capacity to test safety features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8146039.stm |title=Cardiff City 4–0 Chasetown |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 July 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium was officially opened with a friendly against Scottish side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on 22 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8164021.stm |title=Cardiff City 0–0 Celtic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competitive match played at the ground was on 8 August 2009, the opening day of the 2009–10 season, as Cardiff won 4–0 over [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8184416.stm |title=Cardiff City 4–0 Scunthorpe United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened, the [[Cardiff Blues]] rugby union club left their Cardiff Arms Park home to share the new stadium with Cardiff City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/7002590.stm |title=Cardiff teams agree ground share |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move proved unpopular among fans of the rugby club, which returned to Cardiff Arms Park in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-return-arms-park-2030399 |title=Cardiff Blues return to Arms Park as Cardiff City consider rebranding |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Jon |last=Doel |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142103/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-return-arms-park-2030399 |archive-date=9 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after the stadium was built, plans to upgrade and expand the stadium were initiated. The expansion plans were completed in August 2014, and the seating capacity was raised to 33,316. However, in March 2015, it was announced that the Ninian Stand extension was to be shut for the [[2015–16 Cardiff City F.C. season|2015–16]] season due to poor ticket sales, dropping the capacity to 27,978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-new-12m-ninian-8956913 |title=Cardiff City's new £12m Ninian Stand to be mothballed less than a year after opening |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503093457/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-new-12m-ninian-8956913 |archive-date=3 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reopened the following year due to an increase in demand for tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/cardiff-city-fc-confirm-upper-11113104 |title=Cardiff City FC confirm upper Ninian stand to be used for first time this season as 'fantastic fans' flock to Derby game |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Paul |last=Abbandonato |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929164604/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/cardiff-city-fc-confirm-upper-11113104 |archive-date=29 September 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours, kit and crest==
===Colours===
When Riverside A.F.C. was formed in 1899, the club used a chocolate-brown and amber checkered shirt.&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; Following the club's name change to Cardiff City in 1908, they adopted a blue shirt and white or blue shorts and socks, although for the first nine years black socks were used. Kit changes over the club's history have included all blue kits, the introduction of a yellow vertical stripe during the 1970s and alternating blue stripes.&lt;ref name="Historical Kits"/&gt;

In 2012, Cardiff controversially changed their home kit colours from the traditional blue, white and yellow to red and black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 2012/13 kits revealed |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2798727,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516024659/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2798727%2C00.html |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time the club had not worn blue as its primary colour since 1908. The crest was also changed to one in which the [[Welsh Dragon]] was more prominent than the traditional bluebird. These changes were made to "appeal in 'international markets'" as part of a "major investment plan" unveiled by chairman Vincent Tan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18324804|title=Cardiff City to change kit from blue to red amid financial investment|date=6 June 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811210014/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18324804|archive-date=11 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebranding provoked strong opposition from the fans, who organised protest marches and demonstrations to voice their displeasure at the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-designers-criticise-cardiff-citys-2028814 |title=Fans and designers criticise Cardiff City's new emblem |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |first=Simon |last=Gaskell |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812173557/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fans-designers-criticise-cardiff-citys-2028814 |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-26689074 |title=Thousands of Cardiff City fans march against club's blue to red rebrand |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202220221/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-26689074 |archive-date=2 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Tan previously stating that the club would only return to wearing blue if another owner was found, on 9 January 2015, after three seasons playing in the red kit, the club reverted their home kit back to blue with a red away kit in a bid to "unite" the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30741073|title=Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan agrees return to blue home kit|accessdate=9 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110072034/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30741073|archive-date=10 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/09/cardiff-red-to-blue-kit-vincent-tan |title=Cardiff revert to blue kit after Vincent Tan approves change |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=James |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831001855/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/09/cardiff-red-to-blue-kit-vincent-tan |archive-date=31 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crest history===
From 1908 Cardiff played in unadorned shirts. This changed in 1959, when they played in shirts with a simple crest featuring an image of a [[bluebird]]. The following season their shirts were plain and unadorned and remained so until 1965, when they played in shirts with the word "Bluebirds" embroidered.&lt;ref name="Historical Kits"/&gt; A new crest, similar to the one used previously, and again featuring a bluebird, was introduced in 1969. Over the years, a number of variations of this crest have been used. In the 1980s, extra features including words and additional motifs were added. A major change was made in 2012, when owner Vincent Tan attempted to rebrand the club to expand its appeal outside Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18324804|title = Cardiff City to change kit from blue to red amid financial investment|date = 6 June 2012|accessdate = 9 January 2015|website = |publisher = BBC Sport|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141229055050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18324804|archive-date = 29 December 2014|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change gave large prominence to the Welsh Dragon, reducing the bluebird to a minor feature. In March 2015, Cardiff announced a new crest which would once again feature the Bluebird predominantly with an oriental dragon replacing the standard Welsh dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-2015-crest-reveal-2322786.aspx|title = Cardiff City 2015 crest reveal|date = 9 March 2015|accessdate = 9 March 2015|publisher = Cardiff City F.C.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150311150659/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-2015-crest-reveal-2322786.aspx|archive-date = 11 March 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southampton Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Southampton.ogg|s|aʊ|θ|ˈ|(|h|)|æ|m|p|t|ən}}) is a professional [[association football]] club based in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], England, which plays in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]].

Their home ground since 2001 has been [[St Mary's Stadium]], before which they were based at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]]. The club has been nicknamed "The Saints" since its inception in 1885 due to its history as a church football team, founded as St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association, and play in red and white shirts. Southampton has a long-standing rivalry with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] due to its close proximity and both cities' respective [[maritime history]]. Matches between the two sides are known as the [[South Coast derby]].

The club has won the [[FA Cup]] once, in [[1976 FA Cup final|1976]], and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]].&lt;ref name="Second"&gt;{{cite news |title=Caught in Time: Southampton finish runners-up in the First Division, 1984 |first=Greg |last=Struthers |work=The Times |location=London |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article732419.ece |accessdate=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005, ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4525113.stm|title=Southampton 1 – 2 Man Utd|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned after a seven-year absence, and have played there ever since.

==History==
{{Main|History of Southampton F.C.}}

[[File:Southampton FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Southampton in the Football League.]]

===Foundation and Southern League (1885–1920)===
Southampton were originally founded at [[St. Mary's Church, Southampton|St. Mary's Church]], on 21 November 1885 by members of the St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association.

St. Mary's Y.M.A., as they were usually referred to in the local press, played most of their early games on [[Southampton Common|The Common]] where games were frequently interrupted by pedestrians insistent on exercising their right to roam. More important matches, such as cup games, were played either at the [[County Ground, Southampton|County Cricket Ground]] in Northlands Road or the [[Antelope Ground|Antelope Cricket Ground]] in St Mary's Road.

The club was originally known as '''St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C.''' (usually abbreviated to "St. Mary's Y.M.A.") and then became simply '''St. Mary's F.C.''' in [[1887–88 in English football|1887–88]], before adopting the name '''Southampton St. Mary's''' when the club joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1894.

For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including [[Charles Baker (footballer)|Charles Baker]], [[Alf Littlehales]] and [[Lachie Thomson]] from [[Stoke F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Fred Hollands]] from [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref name = "Chalk16"&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|author2=Holley, Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987| isbn= 0-907969-22-4 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the Southern League title in [[1896–97 in English football|1896–97]], the club became a limited company and was renamed '''Southampton F.C.'''

Southampton won the Southern League championship for three years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built £10,000 stadium called [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]], to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain in those early days and the club had to rent the premises first before they could afford to buy the stadium in the early part of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four [[FA Cup Final]]s in [[FA Cup Final 1900|1900]]. On that day, they went down 4–0 to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] as they were beaten 2–1 in a replay of the [[FA Cup Final 1902|1902 final]].

===Joining the Football League (1920–1966)===
After [[World War I]], Saints joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920 which split into [[Football League Third Division South|South]] and [[Football League Third Division North|North]] sections a year later. The [[1921–22 in English football|1921–22 season]] ended in triumph with promotion and marked the beginning of a 31-year stay in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].

The [[1922–23 in English football|1922–23 season]] was a unique "Even Season" – 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 defeats for a total of 42 points, or one point per game. Goals for and against statistics were also equal and the team finished in mid-table.

In 1925 and 1927, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 and 2–1 to Sheffield United and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] respectively.

Saints were briefly forced to switch home matches to the ground of their local rivals [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at [[Fratton Park]] during [[World War II]] when a bomb landed on The Dell pitch in November 1940, leaving an 18-foot crater which damaged an underground culvert and flooded the pitch.

Promotion was narrowly missed in [[1947–48 in English football|1947–48]] when they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following [[1948–49 in English football|season]] (despite having an eight-point lead with eight games to play) whilst in [[1949–50 in English football|1949–50]] they were to be denied promotion by 0.06 of a goal, missing out on second place to Sheffield United. In the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons, [[Charlie Wayman]] rattled in a total of 56 goals. Then relegation in [[1952–53 in English football|1953]] sent Saints sliding back into Division 3 (South).

It took until [[1959–60 in English football|1960]] for Saints to regain Second Division status with [[Derek Reeves]] plundering 39 of the champions' 106 league goals. On 27 April 1963 a crowd of 68,000 at [[Villa Park]] saw them lose 1–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the FA Cup semi-final.

===Reaching the First Division and cup win (1966–1977)===
In [[1965–66 in English football|1966]], when [[Ted Bates (footballer)|Ted Bates]]' team were promoted to the First Division as runners-up, with [[Martin Chivers]] scoring 30 of Saints' 85 league goals.

For the following campaign [[Ron Davies (footballer, born 1942)|Ron Davies]] arrived to score 43 goals in his first season. Saints stayed among the elite for eight years, with the highest finishing position being seventh place in 1968–69 and again in 1970–71. These finishes were high enough for them to qualify for the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1969–70]] (going out in Round 3 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]) and its successor, the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[1971–72 UEFA Cup|1971–72]], when they went out in the first round to [[Athletic Bilbao]].

In December 1973, Bates stood down to be replaced by his assistant [[Lawrie McMenemy]]. The Saints were one of the first victims of the new three-down relegation system in [[1973–74 in English football|1974]].

Under McMenemy's management, Saints started to rebuild in the Second Division, capturing players such as [[Peter Osgood]], [[Jim McCalliog]], [[Jim Steele (footballer)|Jim Steele]] and [[Peter Rodrigues]] (captain) and in 1976, Southampton reached the [[FA Cup Final 1976|FA Cup Final]], playing Manchester United at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], and beat much-fancied United 1–0 with a goal from [[Bobby Stokes]]. The following season, they played in Europe again in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1976–77|Cup Winners' Cup]], reaching Round 3 where they lost 2–3 on aggregate to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].

===Return to First Division (1977–1992)===
In [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78]], captained by [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]], Saints finished runners-up in the Second Division (behind [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]) and returned to the First Division. They finished comfortably in 14th place in their first season back in the top flight. The following season they returned to Wembley in the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] where they acquitted themselves well, losing 3–2 to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].

In 1980, McMenemy made his biggest signing, capturing the [[European Footballer of the Year]] [[Kevin Keegan]]. Although Keegan's Southampton career only lasted two years, Saints fielded an attractive side also containing Alan Ball, prolific goal-scorer Ted MacDougall, (who still holds the record for the largest number of goals in an FA Cup game&amp;nbsp;– nine&amp;nbsp;– for Bournemouth against Margate in an 11–0 win), MacDougall's strike partner at Bournemouth and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] [[Phil Boyer]], club stalwart [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]] and in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]] they scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish. The following season, Kevin Keegan helped lift the club to the top of the First Division. Southampton led the league for over two months, taking top spot on 30 January 1982 and staying there (apart from one week) until 3 April 1982. But in a disappointing end to the season, in which Keegan was hampered by a back injury, Southampton won only two of their last nine games and finished seventh. The winners of a wide-open title race were Keegan's old club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who were crowned champions on the final day of the season. Keegan scored 26 of Southampton's 72 goals that season, but was then sold to Newcastle.

Southampton continued to progress under McMenemy's stewardship, and with a team containing [[Peter Shilton]] (the [[England national football team|England]] goalkeeper), [[Nick Holmes (footballer)|Nick Holmes]], [[David Armstrong (English footballer)|David Armstrong]], striker [[Steve Moran]] and quick winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]] reached their highest ever league finish as runners-up in [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]]&lt;ref name="Second"/&gt; (three points behind the champions Liverpool) as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup losing 1–0 to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Highbury Stadium]]. McMenemy then added experienced midfielder [[Jimmy Case]] to his ranks.

They finished fifth the following year, but as a result of the [[Heysel Disaster]] all English clubs were banned from European competition: had it not been for this, then Southampton would have again qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].

McMenemy left at the end of the 1984–85 season to be succeeded by [[Chris Nicholl]], who was sacked after six years in charge despite preserving the club's top flight status. He was replaced by [[Ian Branfoot]], who until the end of the 1990–91 season had been assistant manager to [[Steve Coppell]] at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was [[Guernsey]]-born attacking midfielder/striker [[Matthew Le Tissier]], who broke into the first team in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]]. He was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team&amp;nbsp;– he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was [[Alan Shearer]], who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a national record of more than £3&amp;nbsp;million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for £15&amp;nbsp;million in 1996. He also scored 30 times for England internationally.

===Southampton in the Premier League (1992–2005)===
Southampton were founding members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992–93, but spent most of the next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In [[1995–96 Southampton F.C. season|1995–96]], Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 3–1 home win over eventual double winners Manchester United, then came a 1–0 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Graeme Souness]], was brought in, signing foreign players such as [[Egil Østenstad]] and [[Eyal Berkovic]]. The highlight of the season was a 6–3 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. However, he had to deal with criticism over the [[Ali Dia (footballer)|Ali Dia]] debacle. He resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] who had won promotion to Division One with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals.

In [[1998–99 Southampton F.C. season|1998–99]], they were rooted to the bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season but again avoided relegation on the last day of the season after a late run of good results, helped by the intervention of Latvian [[Marian Pahars]] and old hero Le Tissier (The so-called "Great Escape"). In 1999, Southampton were given the go-ahead to build a new 32,000-seat stadium in the St Mary's area of the city, having been playing in the Dell since 1898. The stadium had been converted to an all-seater format earlier in the decade, but had a capacity of less than 16,000 and was unsuitable for further expansion.

During the [[1999–2000 Southampton F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], Dave Jones quit as Southampton manager to concentrate on a court case after he was accused of abusing children at the children's home where he had worked during the 1980s. The accusations were later proved to be groundless, but it was too late to save Jones' career as Southampton manager and he was succeeded by ex-England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]]. Hoddle helped keep Southampton well clear of the Premier League drop zone but having received an offer he moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] just before the end of the [[2000–01 Southampton F.C. season|2000–01 season]]. He was replaced by first-team coach [[Stuart Gray (footballer, born 1960)|Stuart Gray]], who oversaw the relocation to the St Mary's Stadium for the 2001–02 season. At the end of the 2000–01 season, in the last competitive match at The Dell, Matthew Le Tissier came on late to score the last ever league goal at the old stadium with a half volley on the turn in a 3–2 win against Arsenal. Gray was sacked after a poor start to the following season, and he was replaced by ex-[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] manager [[Gordon Strachan]], who steered Southampton to safety and a secure 11th-place finish.

In [[2002–03 Southampton F.C. season|2002–03]], Southampton finished eighth in the league and finished [[2003 FA Cup Final|runners-up in the FA Cup]] to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the [[Millennium Stadium]]), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of [[James Beattie (footballer)|James Beattie]], who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two different managers – [[Paul Sturrock]] and [[Steve Wigley]] – had come and gone. Chairman [[Rupert Lowe]] risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed [[Harry Redknapp]] as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at [[South Coast of England|South Coast]] rivals Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saints name Redknapp as boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4077461.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought in a number of new signings, including his son [[Jamie Redknapp|Jamie]] in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager [[Ron Atkinson]] his job.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"/&gt;

Lowe and Southampton continued to make headlines after former [[England national rugby union team|England]] Rugby World Cup-winning coach [[Clive Woodward|Sir Clive Woodward]] joined the club—eventually being appointed technical director in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton confirm Woodward move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4121186.stm|date=22 June 2005|accessdate=30 October 2013|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside the top flight (2005–2012)===
[[File:Before the Kick-off - geograph.org.uk - 431355.jpg|thumb|right|Southampton players form a huddle before kicking off against Derby in 2007]]
In November 2005, manager Harry Redknapp resigned to rejoin Portsmouth, and was replaced by [[George Burley]]. Rupert Lowe resigned as chairman in June 2006, and Jersey-based businessman [[Michael Wilde]], who had become the club's major shareholder assumed the post. Following a club record £6&amp;nbsp;million being spent on transfers, Polish strikers [[Grzegorz Rasiak]] and [[Marek Saganowski]] performed well and the season saw the introduction of 17-year-old [[left back]] [[Gareth Bale]]. Southampton finished in sixth place and lost the play-off semi-final to Derby County on penalties. The board sought new investment in the club, and In February 2007 Wilde stepped down as chairman to be replaced by local businessman [[Leon Crouch]] as "Acting chairman", a role Crouch retained until 21 July 2007. In the [[2007-08 Southampton F.C. season|2007–08 season]], George Burley revealed that players such as Bale and [[Kenwyne Jones]] had to be sold to stop the club going into administration and that failing to achieve promotion had put the club in serious financial difficulty. Burley left the club in January 2008 to take over as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager and was replaced by [[Nigel Pearson]] who saved the club from relegation on the final day.

In July 2008 all the board members except one resigned, allowing Lowe and Wilde to return: Wilde as Chairman of Southampton FC and Rupert Lowe as Chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc. Although Pearson kept the team up, the board did not renew his contract due to financial constraints, and the relatively unknown Dutchman [[Jan Poortvliet]] was appointed manager. Financial troubles continued to mount, resulting in more players being sold or loaned out and parts of St Mary's were closed off to reduce costs. In January 2009, Poortvliet resigned with the club one place from bottom of the Championship, with [[Mark Wotte]] taking over managerial duties.&lt;ref name="Poortvliet resigns"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poortvliet resigns as Saints boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7848414.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=30 October 2013|date=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wotte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/articles/article.php?page_id=11263 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217225957/http://saintsfc.co.uk/articles/article.php?page_id=11263 |archivedate=17 February 2009 |title=Chairman's statement |publisher= Saintsfc.co.uk|date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4073293.Chairman_speaks_about_Jan's_departure/ |title=Chairman speaks about Jan's departure |publisher=''Daily Echo'' |date=24 January 2009|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Southampton's parent company was placed in [[Administration (British football)|administration]]. A ten-point penalty was imposed, but as the team was already being relegated due to finishing second from bottom of the [[Football League Championship]] this points deduction had to apply to the 2009–10 season. By the end of May, the club was unable to meet its staff wages and asked employees to work unpaid as a gesture of goodwill. The administrator warned that the club faced imminent bankruptcy unless a buyer was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1189228/Southampton-crisis-deepens-club-fails-pay-wages-month.html |title=Southampton crisis deepens as club fails to pay wages this month |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, administrator Mark Fry confirmed negotiations with two groups of investors, followed by confirmation that the club had been sold to an overseas buyer "owned and controlled by [[Markus Liebherr]]".&lt;ref name = "Hooray"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4481187.Swiss_Saints_deal_completed/|title=Swiss Saints deal completed|date=8 July 2009|work=Southern Daily Echo|accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebherr brought in Italian businessman [[Nicola Cortese]] to look after the club's business interests on his behalf. In July 2009, with the club in the control of the new owner, Wotte was sacked as head coach and [[Alan Pardew]] was appointed as the new First Team Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton appoint Alan Pardew as new manager|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/5849983/Southampton-appoint-Alan-Pardew-as-new-manager.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saints made their first big signing under Liebherr, striker [[Rickie Lambert]], who was purchased on 10 August from League One side [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol Rovers striker Rickie Lambert seals £1m move to Southampton|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-Rovers-striker-Rickie-Lambert-seals-1m-Southampton/story-11246413-detail/story.html|work=Bristol Post|date=10 August 2009|access-date=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021035122/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-Rovers-striker-Rickie-Lambert-seals-1m-Southampton/story-11246413-detail/story.html|archivedate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton started the 2009–10 season in League One, in the third tier of English football for the first time in 50 years and with −10 points. In March 2010, Southampton won their first trophy since 1976 when they defeated [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 4–1 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] to claim the [[2010 Football League Trophy Final|Football League Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8583783.stm|title= Carlisle 1&amp;nbsp;– 4 Southampton|last=Shemilt|first=Stephan|date=28 March 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton finished the season in 7th place, seven points from the last play-off position.

A new home shirt was unveiled on 10 June 2010, in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary. The design was based on the original St. Mary's Y.M.A. kit used in 1885; it featured the new anniversary crest and was without a sponsor's logo.&lt;ref name="echo_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/saints/news/8213663.New_kit_unveiled_by_Saints/ |title=Southampton return to roots with new home kit |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Newsquest Media Group |work=Southern Daily Echo |author=Dan Kerins |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August, it was announced that Liebherr had died; however, the club's future had been assured and planned for before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2119026,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616093727/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2119026,00.html |archivedate=16 June 2012 |title=Markus Liebherr of Southampton Football Club |publisher= Southampton FC|date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the Championship for the 2011–12 season, Southampton made their best start to a season for 75 years with a winning run at St. Mary's of 13 league games, setting a new club record and going top of the league. In April 2012, Southampton achieved promotion to the Premier League as runners-up to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. The final game of the season game set a record attendance at St Mary's Stadium of 32,363. Lambert finished the season as the Championship's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, his third "Golden Boot" in four seasons. He also won the Championship Player of the Year award.

===Return to the Premier League (2012–present)===
Southampton returned to the Premier league for season 2012–13 initially under Nigel Adkins.

==Stadium and training facilities==
{{Main|St Mary's Stadium|The Dell (Southampton)}}
[[Image:St Mary's Stadium Southampton.jpg|thumb|right|View from the Chapel Stand]]

St Mary's Stadium has been home to the Saints since August 2001. It has a capacity of 32,689&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Mary's Stadium|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/profile.stadium.html/southampton|work=Club profile: Southampton|publisher=The Premier League|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of only a handful of stadia in Europe to meet [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA's Four Star criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/premier-league-stadium-focus-st-marys-stadium-southampton.html |title=Around the grounds: St Mary's Stadium |publisher=Premier League |date=15 July 2013|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has also been host to a number of international games. The ground's record attendance is 32,363, set in a game between Southampton and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Records|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/club/club-records/|website=www.saintsfc.com|publisher=Southampton F.C.|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1898 to 2001, Southampton played their home games at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]]. The purpose-built stadium was redeveloped a number of times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. Following the [[Taylor report]], The Dell was converted to an all-seater stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in England's top-flight, precipitating a move to a new home. Prior to The Dell, the club's home grounds were the [[Antelope Ground]], from 1887 to 1896, and the [[County Ground, Southampton|County Cricket Ground]], from 1896 to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|author2=Holley, Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books| year=1987| isbn= 0-907969-22-4|pages=216–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's training facilities, [[Staplewood Campus]], are located in [[Marchwood]] on the edge of the [[New Forest]]. The current facilities were opened in November 2014, at a cost of almost £40m.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The main building was named after the club's late owner, [[Markus Liebherr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20141105-markus-liebherr-pavilion-2063443.aspx|title=Saints honour Markus Liebherr's memory at new training centre|work=saintsfc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012–13 season, and for the foreseeable future, the club agreed a deal with [[Eastleigh F.C.]], currently of the [[Conference South]], for the use of their stadium, [[Ten Acres]], for The Saints' U21 team fixtures. This continues a partnership with Eastleigh that has lasted for the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saints &amp; Spitfires Link Up|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/saints-spitfires-link-up-511796.aspx|publisher=Southampton FC|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red and White Stripes at St Mary's Stadium - geograph.org.uk - 431347.jpg|thumb|Fans create a [[tifo]] in the St Mary's Stadium]]

==Anthem==
The Saints' anthem is the popular sports tune [[When the Saints Go Marching In (sports tune)|When the Saints Go Marching In]], and since the club's official nickname is "the Saints", they are one of only a few teams who do not change the original lyric.

==Crest==
[[Image:Saints logo 2010.PNG|thumb|left|The 125th Anniversary year crest]]

Originally, the club used the same crest as the one used by the city itself. However, during the 1970s a competition was run for fans to design a new one.

The winning design, designed by Rolland Parris, was used for around 20 years, before being modified slightly by Southampton design agency The Graphics Workshop in the 1990s for copyright reasons.

From top-to-bottom, the halo is a reference to the nickname "Saints", the ball to the nature of the club, the scarf to the fans and the team colours. The tree represents the nearby [[New Forest]] and [[Southampton Common]], with the water representing Southampton's connections with the rivers, seas and oceans.

On 13 May 2010, the official crest for the 125th anniversary was released: "The black outline and halo feature will now appear in gold, whilst the all important years 1885 and 2010 are scripted either side of the shield, with the figure 125 replacing the ball".

The club has spent 27 seasons in English football's top division, the majority of these in two spells during the 1960s and 2000s. The latter spell was associated with former chairman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], after the club had climbed up from the fourth tier in the 1990s. Fulham have never won a major honour, although they have reached two major finals: in 1975, as a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] team, they contested the [[1975 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] for the only time in their history, losing 2–0 to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], and in 2010 they reached the final of the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]], which they contested with [[Atlético Madrid]] in [[Hamburg]], losing 2–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/overview/index.html#200910+atletico+crown+historic+campaign |title=2009/10: Atlético crown historic campaign – |publisher=UEFA.com |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101062354/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/overview/index.html#200910+atletico+crown+historic+campaign |archive-date=1 January 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1879–98: Formation===
[[File:Fulham team from 1886 season.jpg|thumb|right|The Second XI team, in 1886]]
Fulham were formed in 1879 as '''Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School F.C.''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018085447/http://www.standrewsfulham.com/articles/football.html |archivedate=18 October 2009}}, Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School&lt;/ref&gt; founded by worshipers (mostly adept at cricket) at the [[Church of England]] on Star Road, [[Kensington|West Kensington]] (St Andrew's, Fulham Fields). Fulham's mother church still stands today with a plaque commemorating the team's foundation. They won the West London Amateur Cup in 1887 and, having shortened the name from Fulham Excelsior to its present form in 1888, they then won the [[West London League]] in 1893 at the first attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Sir_Leslie_Bowker.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183209/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Sir_Leslie_Bowker.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the club's first ever kits was half red, half white shirts with white shorts worn in the [[1886–87 in English football|1886–87 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History (Dennis Turner, 2004)''. This is the first kit known, and sock colours are not specified.&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham started playing at their current ground at [[Craven Cottage]] in 1896, their first game against now defunct rivals [[Minerva F.C.|Minerva]]. Fulham are one of the oldest established clubs in southern England currently playing professional football, though there are many non-league sides like Kent side [[Cray Wanderers F.C.|Cray Wanderers]] who are several decades older.

[[File:Image of fulham squad c.1903.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of the 1903–04 line-up]]
The club gained professional status on 12 December 1898, the same year that they were admitted into the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Second Division. They were the second club from London to turn professional, following [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], then named Royal Arsenal 1891. They adopted a red and white kit during the [[1900–01 in English football|1900–01 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History'' (Dennis Turner, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1902–03 in English football|1902–03]], the club won promotion from this division, entering the [[Southern Football League|Southern League First Division]]. The club's first recorded all-white club kit came in 1903, and ever since then the club has been playing in all-white shirts and black shorts, with socks going through various evolutions of black and/or white, but are now normally white-only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm Historical Football Kits – Fulham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625231818/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Fulham/Fulham.htm |date=25 June 2007 }} Taken from ''Fulham FC – The Official 125 Year Illustrated History'' (Dennis Turner, 2004) amongst other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The club won the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] twice, in 1905–06 and 1906–07.

===1907–49: Football League===
[[File:Rabbit Hutch at the Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The "Rabbit Hutch" stand along Stevenage Road sometime before [[Archibald Leitch]]'s redesign in 1904–05]]
Fulham joined [[The Football League]] after the second of their Southern League triumphs. The club's first league game, playing in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]'s [[1907–08 in English football#Second Division|1907–08 season]], saw them lose 1–0 at home to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in September 1907. The first win came a few days later at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s [[Baseball Ground]] by a score line of 1–0. Fulham finished the season three points short of promotion in fourth place. The club progressed all the way to the semi-final of that season's [[FA Cup]], a run that included an 8–3 away win at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. In the semi-final, however, they were heavily beaten, 6–0, by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game.&lt;ref&gt;See the FA Cup-specific page in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501164543/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/FACupHistory/RemarkableFailure.aspx club history] on the official website&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the [[1909–10 in English football|1909–10 season]]. Fulham's first season in Division Two turned out to be the highest that the club would finish for 21 years, until in [[1927–28 in English football|1927–28]] when the club were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|3rd Division South]], created in 1920. [[Hussein Hegazi]], an Egyptian forward, was one of the first non-British players to appear in The Football League, though he only played one game for Fulham in 1911, marked with a goal, afterwards playing for non-league [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Decades_of_progress_since_Hodgson_played_in_South_Africa.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183556/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Decades_of_progress_since_Hodgson_played_in_South_Africa.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, businessman and politician [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. When he rejected an offer from businessman [[Gus Mears]] to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal. Fulham became the first British team to sell [[hot dog]]s at their ground in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbHohM1rfY|title=Fulham hot dog 1926|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220014506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbHohM1rfY|archive-date=20 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham had several high-profile international players during the 1920s, including [[Len Oliver (footballer)|Len Oliver]] and [[Albert Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYuQEh9XxEQ|title=Craven Cottage.1929|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218010859/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYuQEh9XxEQ|archive-date=18 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the Third Division South, Fulham won the division in the [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32 season]]. In doing so they beat [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] 10–2, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The [[1932–33 in English football|next season]] they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the [[1935–36 in English football|1935–36 season]]. Fulham were also to draw with Austria in 1936 before [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olxwhn0r1WU|title=FULHAM V AUSTRIA 1934|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.

League and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national [[Football League War Cup]] and a [[London War Cup]] up for grabs. Craven Cottage was used like many grounds for fitness and training of the army youth reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6J5sWaLBlk|title=Craven Cottage.1940|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=16 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215051911/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6J5sWaLBlk|archive-date=15 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for [[1946–47 in English football|1946–47]]. In [[1948–49 in English football|the third season]] of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win-loss-draw record of 24–9–9 (identical to that which won them the Third Division South 17 years previously). [[John Fox Watson]] made a pioneering transfer to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 1948, becoming one of the first players from the [[United Kingdom]] to sign for a high-profile side abroad.

===1949–69: First Division Cottagers===
Promotion to the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the [[1951–52 in English football|1951–52 season]], winning only eight of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Delorimier Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] in front of 29,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm|title=Celtic Programmes Online – Tours of the USA and Canada|publisher=|access-date=19 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905122656/http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm|archive-date=5 September 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Canada_and_the_USA.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506183406/http://lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Blogs/Canada_and_the_USA.asp |archivedate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few seasons of mediocrity in the Second Division followed, but then the club reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1958 and used this momentum to win promotion back to the First Division in the [[1958–59 in English football|following season]], having finished second to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Also joining Fulham in 1958 was [[Graham Leggat]], who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, (making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer). In the [[1959–60 in English football|1959–60 season]], they achieved tenth position in the First Division, which until finishing ninth in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 season]] was their highest-ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.
By this time, the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at Craven Cottage,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx club history] at the official website&lt;/ref&gt; despite struggling in the League.

The club experienced several close escapes from relegation, none more spectacular than in [[1965–66 in English football|1965–66]], when the club rooted at the bottom went on an astounding run beating all the top sides with a few games to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JNj-Gg77rQ|title=Fulham V Liverpool 1966|first=|last=Ged Martin|date=17 November 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218000839/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JNj-Gg77rQ|archive-date=18 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham had just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually, however, the club suffered relegation in the [[1967–68 in English football|1967–68 season]], having won just ten out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only seven in 42, the club were again relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. (Note that this is not the same as the Third Division South, as the regional Third Divisions had been removed with the 1959 creation of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]).

Possibly the single most influential character in Fulham's history is [[Johnny Haynes]].&lt;ref&gt;This is of course somewhat subjective, but he is the first player mentioned in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx Great names] section of the club's history on the official website. He is also the only ex-player to have a stand at [[Craven Cottage]] named after him&lt;/ref&gt; "Mr. Fulham" or "The Maestro," as Haynes later came to be known, signed for The Cottagers as a schoolboy in 1950, making his first team debut on Boxing Day 1952 against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at Craven Cottage. Haynes played for another 18 years, notching 657 appearances (along with many other club records too), his last appearance for Fulham coming on 17 January 1970. He is often considered as the greatest player in Fulham history,&lt;ref&gt;He is the first player listed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120501064123/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/HistoryOverview.aspx great names] section of the club's history on the official website, and was voted as Fulham's number one all-time [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353562.stm 'Cult Hero'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519092610/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353562.stm |date=19 May 2009 }} in a [[BBC]] poll&lt;/ref&gt; and never played for another team in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;He played for [[Durban City F.C.|Durban City]] after leaving Fulham according to [https://archive.is/20081206183009/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/ThenAndNow_JohnnyHaynes.htm The FA]&lt;/ref&gt; He gained 56 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for England (22 as captain),&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/H/Johnny-Haynes his profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113002948/http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/H/Johnny-Haynes |date=13 November 2013 }} at [[The Football Association|the FA]].&lt;/ref&gt; with many being earned while playing for Fulham in the Second Division. Haynes was injured in a car accident in [[Blackpool]] in 1962, but by his own admissions never regained the fitness or form to play for England again, missing out on England's victory in the [[FIFA World Cup 1966]] for which he would have stood a chance of being selected.&lt;ref&gt;According to an interview with him from [https://archive.is/20081206183009/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/ThenAndNow_JohnnyHaynes.htm The FA]&lt;/ref&gt; The Stevenage Road Stand was renamed in his honour after his death in a car crash in 2005.

===1970–94: Mixed fortunes outside the top flight===
The aforementioned Third Division hiatus lasted only two seasons before the club was promoted back to the Second Division as runners-up in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]]. This spell also saw Fulham invited to the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]], which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972–73 season. This preceded a period of high-profile signings for the club under [[Alec Stock]] in the mid-1970s, including [[Alan Mullery]] and [[Bobby Moore]]. Fulham reached their only FA Cup final in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club then lost to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the final. This gained the club qualification to another European tournament, the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]], where they made the final, losing to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].

[[George Best]] played 47 times for the club in the [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77 season]]. [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play First Division football and play for England, rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.

The club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80 season]], which eventually resulted in [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]]'s sacking in October 1980, to be replaced by [[Malcolm Macdonald]]. With a strong squad during his 1980–1984 period in charge (with players such as [[Ray Houghton]], [[Tony Gale]], [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]], [[Gerry Peyton]] and [[Ray Lewington]]), they won promotion again in [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] back to the Second Division, although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender [[Dave Clement]] a few weeks before promotion was sealed.

In 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now [[London Broncos]] designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club, but which made financial losses every year while linked to Fulham F.C. Then called "Fulham Rugby League," they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.

In 1978, Fulham had signed Gordon "Ivor" Davies who, during two spells at Fulham, became the club's leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions; the record still stands. Fulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], losing 1–0 to Derby County away on the last day of the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83 season]] – although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a [[pitch invasion]] and inexplicably never replayed or finished. The side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an ill-advised merger attempt with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. It was only the intervention of ex-player [[Jimmy Hill]] that allowed the club to stay in business as a re-structured Fulham FC 1987 Ltd. In 1987, the club took part in what was then the longest penalty deciders ever recorded – it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] following a [[Football League Trophy|Freight Rover Trophy]] match.

In 1992, the foundation of the [[Premier League]], and the resignation of 22 clubs from The Football League, restored Fulham to that league's Second Division. However, the club were relegated to the new Third Division after a poor [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]], following which [[Ian Branfoot]] was appointed as team manager.

After an eighth-place finish in Branfoot's [[1994-95 in English football|first season]] in charge, the club hit its lowest-ever final league position in the [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] season, finishing 17th out of 24.&lt;ref name="Final 1994/1995 Football League Two Table"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; Branfoot was sacked as manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while. In February 1996, [[Micky Adams]] became [[player-manager]]. Adams oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of relegation danger. The next season, he engineered a second-place league finish, missing out on first place because several years previously the league had dropped the old "goal difference" system in favour of a "goals scored" tally, meaning Fulham finished behind [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. The club's chairman Jimmy Hill had argued that goals scored should decide places of teams tied on points, and the Football League clubs had voted the system in.

Egyptian businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] bought the club for £6.25&amp;nbsp;million in summer 1997.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 February 2003|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|title=Fulham pushed out Hill|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Mihir|last=Bose|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174720/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|archive-date=31 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"/&gt; Micky Adams was replaced by Al-Fayed in the aftermath of a mid-table start to the season. He installed a two-tier management "dream team" of [[Ray Wilkins]] as First Team Manager and [[Kevin Keegan]] as chief operating officer,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/Managers/KeeganAndWilkins.aspx 'Keegan &amp; Wilkins' page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501151428/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/Managers/KeeganAndWilkins.aspx |date=1 May 2012 }} the club's official website&lt;/ref&gt; pledging that the club would reach the Premier League within five years. After an argument over team selection, Wilkins left the club in May 1998 to hand over the full managerial duties to Keegan, who helped steer the club to promotion the next season, winning 101 points out of a possible 138, after spending £1.1&amp;nbsp;million to sign [[Paul Peschisolido]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], who was top scorer and captained by [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] – then the most expensive footballer outside the top two divisions of the English league.

In 1999, Keegan left Fulham to become manager of England, and [[Paul Bracewell]] was put in charge.
Bracewell was sacked in March 2000, as Fulham's promising early season form dwindled away to a mid-table finish. Frenchman [[Jean Tigana]] was put in charge and, having signed a number of young stars (including French striker [[Louis Saha]]), he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in the [[2000–01 in English football#Football League First Division|2000–01 season]], giving Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968. Fulham once again amassed 101 points out of a possible 138 in their scintillating title run, which was crowned with an open-top bus parade down [[Fulham Palace Road]]. They are the only team to have twice reached 100 points in a season. During the season, Chris Coleman was involved in a car crash that put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw a large turnover of players, with the only player to play for the club in all four leagues being [[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]].

Fulham returned to the top division of English football, and competed in the Premier League for the first time. The club finished the [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02 season]] in 13th place. Fulham were the only team to host top-flight football with some standing areas in the 21st century, but due to [[Taylor report|restrictions on standing]], this was not allowed to continue; clubs promoted from the second division had only three years to make their ground all-seater. Fulham were forced to [[groundshare]] with QPR at [[Loftus Road]] during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons while Craven Cottage was rebuilt as an all-seated stadium. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage, after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.&lt;ref name="future-hangs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham's future hangs in balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|author=BBC News|date=15 September 2003|access-date=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]], Fulham spent most of the season in the lower half of the table. Chairman Al-Fayed told manager Jean Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. However, with five games left to play and relegation still possible, Tigana was sacked, and Chris Coleman was temporarily put in charge. Fulham won 10 points from a possible 15 and managed to avoid relegation. Coleman was appointed manager on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003; despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation,&lt;ref&gt;Two of three writers of [[The Independent]] newspaper [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html predict] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106601318.html |date=* }} relegation for Fulham in the 2003–04 season.&lt;/ref&gt; he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish [[2003–04 FA Premier League|in his debut season]]. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], for whom they received a club record £13&amp;nbsp;million.

Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7&amp;nbsp;million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.&lt;ref name="fulham-lose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham lose Tigana court battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|author=BBC News|date=12 November 2004|access-date=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman notched up another satisfactory performance in the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05 season]] and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish. The following season Fulham improved by one place, finishing 12th – the high point of the season was a 1–0 win over local rivals and reigning champions Chelsea in the [[West London derby]] – Chelsea had only lost two games in two and a half years. The [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07 season]] proved to be Coleman's last, as on 10 April 2007, Fulham terminated his contract with immediate effect. His replacement was [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]]. Fulham only gained four points from five games with Sanchez as caretaker manager. They ensured top-flight survival that season by defeating a weakened [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] side 1–0 in the penultimate match of the season, and Sanchez was appointed manager.

Sanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer break, but, after just two league wins in the first five months of the season and with Fulham in the relegation zone, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007 after a defeat to Newcastle United.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Manager Sanchez sacked by Fulham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7155545.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |postscript= |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222060332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7155545.stm |archive-date=22 December 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Hodgson]] was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007 and took up his contractual duties on 30 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fulham appoint Hodgson as manager | date=28 December 2007 | accessdate=3 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231070143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/7163374.stm | archive-date=31 December 2007 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; just two days before the January transfer window opened.

Hodgson's tenure did not start well and it took a month to secure his first win, against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], courtesy of a [[Jimmy Bullard]] free-kick. Fulham continued to struggle and a 3–1 home defeat in April at the hands of fellow strugglers [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/crying-shame-for-hodgson-as-fulham-look-doomed/792|title=Crying shame for Hodgson as Fulham look doomed|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|publisher=|access-date=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234314/http://www.sport.co.uk/football/crying-shame-for-hodgson-as-fulham-look-doomed/792|archive-date=2 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable. The turning point of the season came in the third-to-last match, against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Fulham trailed 2–0 at half-time and had the Premier League scores at that time become results, they would have been relegated. However, the introduction of [[Diomansy Kamara]] heralded the start of a fantastic comeback—Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered an amazing 3–2 victory. Fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at Craven Cottage, leaving survival in the club's own hands. Barring a goal-rush from fellow strugglers [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], a win against a [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] side looking ahead to their fourth FA Cup final would guarantee survival.

With 15 minutes to play at Portsmouth, Fulham were drawing, and with Birmingham City and Reading leading comfortably against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and Derby County respectively, they looked likely to be relegated. However, Fulham earned a free-kick with 76 minutes played; Jimmy Bullard's delivery found [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore. Fulham narrowly missed out on a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] place via [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fairplay]] by a dubious 0.8 of a point behind Manchester City, who lost 8–1 at Middlesbrough.

In the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]], Fulham finished seventh, their highest-ever league placing, earning qualification for the inaugural [[UEFA Europa League]], the second time that the club had entered a UEFA competition.

[[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]] was arguably the most successful season in the club's history. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the quarter-finals for the second year running, and finished 12th in the Premier League, despite fielding weakened teams in the last few matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8665276.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arsenal 4–0 Fulham | date=9 May 2010 | access-date=9 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222622/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8665276.stm | archive-date=12 January 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the inaugural [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League season]], however, Fulham reached the final, meeting Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]], who had dropped down from the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], at the [[Volksparkstadion]] in [[Hamburg]]. In their first European cup final, the Cottagers were beaten 2–1 after extra time, having drawn 1–1 after full-time. The achievement of taking Fulham so unexpectedly far, beating famous teams like [[Hamburger SV]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], holders [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[FC Basel|Basel]] in the competition, led to Roy Hodgson being voted the [[LMA Manager of the Year]] by the widest margin in the history of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739 |title=Fulham's Roy Hodgson voted Manager of the Year by fellow bosses – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231143218/http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=784847&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739 |archive-date=31 December 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The home match in the round of 16 was arguably Fulham's greatest result in the history of the club. Despite losing 3–1 in the first leg at Italian giants Juventus and falling behind minutes into the second leg at Craven Cottage, Fulham scored four goals with no reply from Juventus.

At the end of the season, Hodgson left Fulham to manage Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8721942.stm|title = Roy Hodgson leaves Fulham to become Liverpool manager|publisher = BBC Sport|accessdate = 1 July 2010|date = 1 July 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112211336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8721942.stm|archive-date = 12 January 2016|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–13: Established in the Premier League===
On 29 July 2010, [[Mark Hughes]] was named the successor to Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. Hughes had previously managed Manchester City, the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national team]] and Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/8866133.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hughes confirmed as Fulham boss | date=29 July 2010 | access-date=29 July 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112211338/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/8866133.stm | archive-date=12 January 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' first match in charge was against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]]. The highlight of the season was a 4–0 win in the FA Cup over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, all goals coming in the first half. Hughes resigned as manager of Fulham on 2 June 2011, having spent fewer than 11 months at the club. The Whites had an encouraging finish in eighth position and qualified for the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] via Fairplay.

On 7 June 2011, [[Martin Jol]] signed a two-year contract with Fulham, becoming successor to Hughes. Jol's first match was a 3–0 Europa League win against [[NSÍ Runavík]] of the [[Faroe Islands]] on 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13959909|title=Fulham 3 – 0 Nes Soknar Itrottarfelag|publisher=BBC|date=12 November 2013|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127192831/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13959909|archive-date=27 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham then navigated their way with some ease to the group stage in the Europa League through late summer. However, the Cottagers were knocked out with the last seconds of the group stage matches, [[Odense BK]] equalising to make a draw, leaving Fulham in third place, with Polish side [[Wisła Kraków]] instead progressing to the next round.

Fulham's Premier League form in the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]] was mixed, with the continuing away-record hangover of previous seasons dragging on. In October 2011, Fulham had an emphatic 6–0 home win over neighbours QPR, with [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] scoring a hat-trick for Fulham in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15051267 |title=Fulham 6 QPR 0 |work=BBC Sport |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017175912/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15051267 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The January 2012 transfer window saw [[Bobby Zamora]] move over the Hammersmith flyover to Loftus Road, with Russian striker [[Pavel Pogrebnyak]] coming in place from [[VfB Stuttgart]].

[[File:Clint.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Dempsey]] scored a club record 50 Premier League goals for Fulham between 2007 and 2012.]]
The New Year saw two further hat-tricks scored by [[Clint Dempsey]]. On 11 February 2012, Progrebnyak scored on his debut in the 2–1 win over Stoke City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16884253 |title=Fulham 2 Stoke 1 |work=BBC Sport |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206112859/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16884253 |archive-date=6 December 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, a 5–0 win against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] saw a hat-trick from Pogrebnyak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17175770 |title=Fulham 5 Wolves 0 |work=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303212134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17175770 |archive-date=3 March 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cottagers broke their historic drought on [[Merseyside]] with a 1–0 win over Liverpool at [[Anfield]] on May Day and another win against Sunderland in the last home game meant Fulham were only one point short of equalling their largest points haul in the Premier League, with just one game remaining. However, they failed to achieve this after losing their last game away at Tottenham.

In the [[2012–13 Premier League|2012–13 season]], Fulham ended a seven-match winless run by beating [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] 3–0 away at the [[Liberty Stadium]] on the final game of the season on 19 May 2013. Fulham finished the season in 12th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kempson |first=Russell |date=19 May 2013 |title=Alexander Kacaniklic sets Fulham on victory road against Swansea City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/19/swansea-fulham-premier-league-match-report |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165944/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/19/swansea-fulham-premier-league-match-report |archive-date=13 November 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ownership of Fulham, Al-Fayed had provided Fulham F.C. with £187 million in interest-free loans.&lt;ref name="record-losses"&gt;{{Cite news |date=19 May 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole |title=Record income but record losses for Premier League |work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=David |last=Conn |access-date=11 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201173253/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole |archive-date=1 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 Fulham posted annual losses of £16.9 million, with Al-Fayed stating that he would "continue to make funds available to achieve our goals both on and off the pitch" and that "the continued success of Fulham and its eventual financial self-sustainability is my priority."&lt;ref name="losses-despite"&gt;{{Cite news|date=15 March 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12746757|title=Fulham football club losses up despite on-field success|publisher=BBC News|access-date=20 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112222626/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12746757|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013 Fulham were effectively debt-free as Al-Fayed converted the loans into equity in the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/29/fulham-debt-free-al-fayed|title=Fulham effectively debt-free as Fayed converts loans into equity|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113022615/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/29/fulham-debt-free-al-fayed|archive-date=13 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors==
Fulham's sponsorship by [[Betfair]] in 2002–03 was the first gambling sponsorship in English football, and came before the [[Gambling Act 2005]] permitted the industry to advertise on television and radio; within fifteen years half of Premier League teams were sponsored by such companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Longley |first1=Scott |title=A short history of betting shirt sponsorship in football (part 1) |url=https://sbcnews.co.uk/features/comment/2018/03/14/scott-longley-short-history-betting-shirt-sponsorship-football-part-1/ |accessdate=22 September 2018 |publisher=SBC News |date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922211612/https://sbcnews.co.uk/features/comment/2018/03/14/scott-longley-short-history-betting-shirt-sponsorship-football-part-1/ |archive-date=22 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuben |first1=Anthony |title=Premier League shirts row: The fickle fashions of sponsorship |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45440347 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=22 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922002206/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45440347 |archive-date=22 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fulham in Europe==
{{Main|Fulham F.C. in European football}}

Fulham are a member of the [[European Club Association]], having qualified three times for European Competition, qualifying for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] after their inaugural season in the Premier League, and the [[UEFA Europa League]] twice, they played in the inaugural edition of the competition after their club-best seventh-place finish in the [[2008–09 Premier League]] season, and qualified again for the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|2011–12 Europa League]] via England's Fair Play berth. Fulham are unbeaten at home in European competition, in 23 games, with a record of 17 wins and six draws.

On 18 February 2010, Fulham's home unbeaten run in European competition stretched to 13 games when they beat UEFA Cup holders Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine 2–1 at Craven Cottage in the Europa League Round of 32 first leg, with goals from [[Zoltán Gera]] and [[Bobby Zamora]]. In Fulham's 46 games in all European competitions, (excluding the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final]] lost in extra-time) they have only lost seven of them (all away): 2–1 to [[Hertha BSC]], 1–0 to [[FC Amkar Perm|Amkar Perm]], 2–1 to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], 3–1 to Juventus, 1–0 to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, 1–0 to [[FC Twente|Twente]] and 1–0 to [[Wisła Kraków]].

After defeating Juventus on 18 March, Fulham advanced to the quarter-finals against reigning German champions [[VfL Wolfsburg]]. On 1 April, Fulham defeated the Germans 2–1 in the first leg of the two-legged home-and-away series. Bobby Zamora and [[Damien Duff]] scored within five minutes of each other in the second half, while Wolfsburg defender [[Alexander Madlung]] scored two minutes from time to cut the deficit in half. One week later at Wolfsburg, Zamora struck again, this time in the first minute to give Fulham an overall 3–1 lead in the series. Wolfsburg were unable to overturn the two goal deficit, and Fulham advanced to the semi-finals of the competition. On 22 April, following a long coach trip due to flights being grounded because of the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|Icelandic volcano]], Fulham played out a 0–0 draw against [[Hamburger SV]] in the first leg of their semi-final in Hamburg. On 29 April, they then beat Hamburg 2–1 at Craven Cottage to secure a place in [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]].

On 12 May, Fulham lost 2–1 after extra time to [[Atlético Madrid]] in the final. Fulham went 1–0 down, though it ended 1–1 after 90 minutes thanks to a Davies equaliser to force extra time. [[Diego Forlán]], however, scored the winner on the 116th minute to clinch the game for the Spanish team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|title=Fulham 2 – 1 Hamburg (agg 2 – 1)|date=28 April 2010|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2010|first=Phil|last=McNulty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501140012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|archive-date=1 May 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulham qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League by virtue of the Fair Play league. They started their campaign in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League#First qualifying round|first qualifying round]], beating [[NSÍ Runavík]], followed by a win over [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League#Second qualifying round|Second qualifying round]]. A 3–1 aggregate win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk saw them into the group stages, where they were drawn against Twente, [[Odense BK|Odense]] and Wisła Kraków in group K. They were knocked out of the tournament when Odense equalised for a 2–2 draw in the very last second of the final group game, leaving Fulham stranded in third, with Kraków going through along with Twente in first.

Fulham consider their secondary rivals to be [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Fulham last played QPR in the [[2000–01 in English football#Football League First Division|2000–01 season]] before meeting them again twice in the 2011–12 Premier League season in which Fulham were the victors with a 6–0 victory at Craven Cottage, and beating them 1–0 away from home at [[Loftus Road]].&lt;ref name=rivalsqpr&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/249893/report ''Match Report – Fulham v QPR – 2 October 2011''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113075901/http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/249893/report |date=13 November 2013 }} Sky Sports&lt;/ref&gt; Fulham also have rivalries with other London clubs, including [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Outside of London, [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] are still considered rivals to Fulham supporters despite the two clubs having played in different divisions for the past 11 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Fulham and Gillingham have been involved in several ill-tempered matches in the lower leagues, including the death of a Fulham supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/199637.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK {{!}} Football fan jailed for killing rival supporter|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulham's fan base has fluctuated over the years, with high crowds coinciding with the club's success in the Premier League so that the club now averages in the top 20 home attendances in the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Fulham supporters have played a vital role in the club's long term stay at Craven Cottage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} When the club moved temporarily to Loftus Road, a committee known as Back to the Cottage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamsupporterstrust.com |title=News |publisher=Fulham Supporters Trust |date= |accessdate=17 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090316220745/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Players/Postings/2004/11/EnglandProfile_JohnnyHaynes.htm |archivedate=16 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed, committed to ensuring the club continued to play at their traditional home.

==Managers==
Fulham have had 37 managers in 114 years. Prior to the appointment of the first manager at the club (Bradshaw in 1904), the duties normally assigned to a modern-day manager would have been shared between club secretary, captain, and other officials.

&lt;!-- Do NOT add Scott Parker to this table, this table does not include caretakers. --&gt;

* * [[Frank Osborne (footballer)|Frank Osborne]] was employed continuously by the club from 1948 to 1963, but only spent the above periods as designated manager.
* ** Ian Branfoot continued to be employed by the club after his dismissal as manager.
* &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Kevin Keegan was employed by the club as chief operating officer (during which time he essentially acted as an [[Assistant coach|assistant manager]]) during the time of his predecessor (Ray Wilkins) being the actual manager.
* &lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; René Meulensteen was appointed as Head Coach under previous manager [[Martin Jol]] (during which time he essentially acted as an assistant manager), but never took on the title of "manager" after Jol's departure, despite assuming the duties usually assigned to one. He remained as Head Coach for four days after Magath's appointment before being released.
* &lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; Some managers have only had the official description of "Head Coach" rather than "Manager": René Meulensteen and Slaviša Jokanović, as well as interim head coach Peter Grant.

'''Managerial records:'''
*Only one man has managed the club through two different spells, Frank Osborne, in 1948–49 and then 1953–56.
*The longest spell as Fulham manager was by Phil Kelso, 15 years (1909–1924)
*Several managers have failed to last more than a year at the club: Bobby Robson, Alan Dicks, Ray Wilkins, Paul Bracewell, Lawrie Sanchez, Mark Hughes, Rene Meulensteen and Felix Magath. Further to this, Frank Osborne only had a year after his initial arrival at the club during which he was principally in charge of the team (before Dodgin, senior) arrived, although he later took sole charge of the club for an extended period.

'''Temporary managers''' at the club have included:
*[[Johnny Haynes]]: Took over after [[Bobby Robson|Sir Bobby Robson]] was fired in 1968 for only a handful of matches. ''The Maestro'' was offered the role permanently but had no inclination to become a manager.
*[[Karl-Heinz Riedle]]: when Paul Bracewell was fired halfway through the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999–2000]] season, there was a temporary period of Fulham being managed by their [[striker (football)|striker]] Karl-Heinz Riedle, assisted his old boss at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Roy Evans]]. Riedle injured a lung in the season's penultimate game.
*[[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]]: after Tigana resigned four months before planned in 2003, Chris Coleman was appointed as caretaker manager, much to the delight of the fans. Having initially denied he wanted the post, Coleman accepted the role of full-time manager that summer.
*[[Lawrie Sanchez]]: when Coleman was sacked, Sanchez came in to take control of the club for the remaining five games of the season. (See above)&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6543541.stm 'Coleman out as Sanchez takes over'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423131733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6543541.stm |date=23 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ray Lewington]]: took temporary charge of Fulham for three games following Lawrie Sanchez's dismissal in December 2007.  Lewington also took temporary charge of the club in July 2010 after Roy Hodgson had left the club until the appointment of Mark Hughes.
*[[Kit Symons]]: temporarily took charge of Fulham after Felix Magath's dismissal in September 2014 before being appointed on 29 October.
*[[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]]: took charge of Fulham for three games after [[Kit Symons]]' dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FulhamFC/status/667721213490368513|title=Fulham Football Club on Twitter: "Peter Grant, who will be taking the First Team for the MK Dons game, discusses training &amp; looks ahead to the match"|work=Twitter|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Stuart Gray (footballer, born 1960)|Stuart Gray]]: succeeded Grant as temporary manager (holding down the job title of "senior coach") after poor results in Grant's three games in charge whilst the board looked for a permanent successor to Kit Symons.
*[[Scott Parker]]: took over as caretaker after [[Claudio Ranieri]] left the club on 28 February 2019 after winning just 3 of his 17 league games in charge.

==Grounds==
Between the years 1879 and when Fulham had a ground to call their own in 1896, they played at a number of stadiums, only some of which were recorded and this should not be regarded as a full or complete list. Only rivals and former landlords Queens Park Rangers have played at more home stadiums. Some of the early grounds listed below are likely to have been parks and parkland, which have now been developed. Even when the club purchased Craven Cottage and the surrounding land in 1894, they had to wait two years before they could play a game there.
* 1879: (possible first ground though records are inaccurate) – [[Hurlingham Park]], [[Fulham]]
* 1879–83: [[Star Road]], [[Hammersmith]]
* 1883–84: [[Eel Brook Common]], Fulham
* 1884–85: [[Lillie Rec]], Fulham
* 1885–86: [[Putney Lower Common]], [[Putney]]
* 1886–88: [[Ranelagh House]], Fulham
* 1888–89: [[Barn Elms|Barn Elms Playing Fields]], [[Barnes (London suburb)|Barnes]] (the rugby fields are located across the Thames from Craven Cottage today)
* 1889–91: [[Parsons Green (Park)|Parsons Green]], Fulham and Roskell's Fields (next to [[Parsons Green tube station|Parsons Green Underground station]])
* 1891–95: [[The Half Moon (music venue)|Half Moon]], [[Putney]]
* 1895–96: [[Brompton, Kensington|West Brompton]]
* 1896–2002: [[Craven Cottage]], Fulham
* 2002–04: [[Loftus Road]], [[Shepherd's Bush]] (groundshare with Queens Park Rangers during Craven Cottage's renovation)

Billy blamed his badger hearing and eyesight for the incident, and apologised to referee [[Chris Foy (referee)|Chris Foy]].{{cn|date=January 2019}} On 11 March 2009, Billy walked across the goal during a match although it was not spotted by the referee.{{cn|date=January 2019}} The former mascot for Fulham was Sir Craven of Cottage, the Knight. The cheerleaders were known as the Cravenettes.

'''Huddersfield Town Association Football Club''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club in [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, which competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football.

Huddersfield became the first English club to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926, a feat which only three other clubs have matched. The first two league titles were won under legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]], who also led the club to an [[FA Cup]] win in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]]. In the late 1950s the club was managed by [[Bill Shankly]] and featured [[Denis Law]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]]. Following relegation from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1972, Huddersfield spent 45 years in the second, third and fourth tiers of English football, before returning to the top flight in 2017. 

Nicknamed The Terriers, the club plays in blue and white vertically-striped shirts and white shorts. They play their home games at the [[Kirklees Stadium]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Huddersfield Town A.F.C.}}

[[File:Huddersfield Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|Chart showing the progress of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]In 1910, just three years after being founded, Huddersfield entered [[the Football League]] for the first time. In November 1919 a fund-raising campaign was needed to avoid a move to [[Leeds]]. Citizens of Huddersfield were asked to buy shares in the club for £1 each, and the club staved off the proposed merger. The team went on to reach the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] and win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]].

Huddersfield became the first English team to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926 – a feat that only three other clubs ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) have been able to match – and was achieved under the leadership of legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]] and his successor [[Cecil Potter]]. Huddersfield Town also won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]] and the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] the same year and have been runners-up on four other occasions in the FA Cup. During the club's heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, they achieved a record attendance of 67,037 on 27 February 1932 during their FA Cup 6th round tie against Arsenal at [[Leeds Road]]. This attendance has been bettered by only 13 other clubs in the history of the Football League.

After the [[Second World War]], the club began a gradual decline, losing its [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status in [[1951–52 Football League|1952]]. They came straight back up, but were relegated again three seasons later. Before the start of the [[1969–70 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1969–70]] season, Huddersfield Town adopted the nickname "''The Terriers''". They won the Second Division title that season, spending the next two seasons in the top flight. After that they moved up and down through the lower three divisions for 45 years.

In 1998, the club attracted the attention of local businessman Barry Rubery and, after protracted takeover talks, he took over the running of the club, promising significant investment as the club sought [[Premier League|Premiership]] status. However, the club did not make it back to the top flight and fell two divisions. The club was sold by Rubery to David Taylor and under Taylor's ownership, slipped into administration. In the summer of 2003, the Terriers came out of administration under the new ownership of [[Ken Davy]].

In [[2010–11 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2010–11]], Huddersfield went 43 games unbeaten, the second-highest in the league after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] 49-match run of 2003–04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Huddersfield's record run ends after 43 matches |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-huddersfield/huddersfields-record-run-ends-after-43-matches-idUKTRE7AS0HS20111129 |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2012, following a penalty shoot-out in the [[2012 Football League One play-off Final]] victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Huddersfield were promoted to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. The shoot-out was the longest contested in the current League One play-offs format. After eleven rounds, the final score was 8–7 to Huddersfield, with the winning goal being scored by goalkeeper [[Alex Smithies]].

In November 2015, German-born ex-[[United States men's national soccer team|US international]] [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] was appointed head coach, becoming the first person born outside the [[British Isles]] to manage the club in their 107-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Wagner named new Huddersfield Town head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34733422 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2017, the club successfully earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time (since the rebranding in 1992) and the English top flight for the first time since [[1971–72 Football League|1972]], beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 4–3 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time in the [[2017 EFL Championship play-off Final|Championship play-off Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Huddersfield Town 0 -0 Reading (4-3 Pens) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39995791 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2018, the club secured safety from relegation, earning another season in the Premier League, following a 1–1 draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and went on to place 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chelsea 1–1 Huddersfield Town | author =  | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 9 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 May 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180508144829/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-date = 8 May 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club suffered a very poor start to the following season - with them taking just 2 wins in 22 matches. With the team rooted to the bottom of the table with just 11 points on the board, Wagner left the club by mutual consent on 14 January 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46864005|title=David Wagner: Huddersfield Town manager leaves club by mutual consent|date=14 January 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced with former [[Borussia Dortmund II]] manager [[Jan Siewert]] on a 2 year deal. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46943388&lt;/ref&gt;

==Badge and colours==
The club spent over five years debating what colour the kit should be. It ranged from [[salmon pink]] to plain white or all-blue to white with blue [[yoke]]. Eventually in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1913–14|1913]], the club adopted the blue-and-white jersey that remains to this day.

The club badge is based on the [[coat of arms]] of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] based on the local Huddersfield Corporation coat of arms. It appeared again with a [[Yorkshire Rose]] for the [[1922 FA Cup Final]] and again for the finals of [[1928 FA Cup Final|1928]], [[1930 FA Cup Final|1930]] and [[1938 FA Cup Final|1938]]. The club's main [[color|colours]] (blue and white) are evident throughout the badge both in the [[mantling]] and in the [[shield]], in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire White Roses and [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]] form part of the history of the club and the area.

Town stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966–67|1966]], when [[Scotland|Scottish]] manager [[Tom Johnston (footballer)|Tom Johnston]] introduced all-blue shirts. The next badge did not feature until the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966–67|1966–67 season]], when the simple "HTFC" adorned the Town's all-blue shirts.

When the club adopted the nickname "The Terriers" for the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1969–70|1969–70 season]], the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words "The Terriers", just in time for their promotion to the big time, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The [[Yorkshire terrier|terrier]] sits on top of the crest with a [[ball]] on a blanket of blue and white stripes. The Terriers was introduced to the badge shortly after "The Terriers" was adopted as the nickname and [[mascot]] of the club.

After relegation to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], Town returned to all-blue shirts with the return of Tom Johnston in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975–76|1975]]. This time they only lasted two seasons and the return of simply "HTFC" badge. This lasted from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975–76|1975]]–[[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1976–77|1977]]. Stripes returned from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1977–78|the 1977–78 season]] and has been the club's home kit ever since. The red Terrier returned to the shirt for [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1978–79|the 1978–79 season]]. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today based on the coat of arms of Huddersfield. This is both the club badge and playing shirt badge and is held in high esteem by Town fans.

In 2000, Town changed badge to a circular design, but that was never popular and following a change of board, returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small but significant adaptation in February 2005. The club took the decision to remove "A.F.C." from the text leaving only the wording 'Huddersfield Town'. The current board said that this was in keeping with the time and to make merchandise easier to produce and to make slicker looking promotional material.

[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] are considered to be the club's main rivals, with Huddersfield having the better head-to-head record of the two teams. Huddersfield have won 32 of the 78 derbies between the two sides with 19 draws and 27 Leeds wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=1524&amp;team2_id=1309|title=Bet on Leeds vs Huddersfield {{!}} Soccer Base|website=www.soccerbase.com|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516103500/http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/head_to_head.sd?team_id=1524&amp;team2_id=1309|archive-date=16 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huddersfield's other local rivals are [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]; this is due to both clubs having had roughly the same league status for the last couple of decades and therefore it could be argued that they are closest rivals out of the three West Yorkshire teams.  Huddersfield also have the better head-to-head record between between the two, winning 21 derbies with 17 draws and 14 Bradford wins.

There are smaller rivalries with [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] (31 wins, 15 draws, 26 defeats), [[A62 Derby|Roses]] rivals [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] (20 wins, 15 draws, 12 defeats) and formerly with near neighbours [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] (8 wins, 5 draws, 4 defeats).  [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] were also once considered rivals during the time that the two clubs were competing in the old First Division - Manchester City lead in the head-to-heads, however, with 27 victories to Huddersfield's 22, with 30 drawn games between them.
