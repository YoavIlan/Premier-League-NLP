'''Petr Čech''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈpɛtr̩ ˈtʃɛx|-|Cs-Petr_Cech.ogg}}; born 20 May 1982) is a Czech professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

Born in [[Plzeň]], Čech began his senior career at [[FK Chmel Blšany|Chmel Blšany]] in 1999, where he played sporadically for two seasons prior to relocating to domestic superpower [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] in 2001. At age 19, Čech became a first team regular, and his single campaign with the club was fruitful, as he registered a league record of not conceding a goal in 903 competitive minutes. This garnered him his first move abroad, when he relocated to France to join [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] for a fee of €5.5 million (£3.9 million) in 2002.

In France, Čech starred in an under-performing team, and soon moved to Premier League side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee of £7 million (€9.8 million) in 2004, which was then a club record transfer for a goalkeeper. During his eleven year stay at the club, Čech registered 486 senior appearances, making him the club's highest overseas appearance maker, and sixth [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics#All-time appearances|all-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/300954/analysis|title=Mourinho's mistake|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=4 April 2014|work=BSkyB|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206152025/http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/300954/analysis|archivedate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped the club win four [[List of English football champions|Premier League titles]], four [[FA Cup]]s, three [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]s, one [[UEFA Europa League]] title, and one [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|UEFA Champions League]] title. He also holds the club [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics|all-time]] record for clean sheets, with 220. Čech departed Chelsea in 2015 to join city rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for a fee of £10 million, where he won another FA Cup and two [[FA Community Shield]]s.

A Czech international, Čech made his debut with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in 2002, and is the [[Czech Republic national football team#Most capped Czech Republic players|most capped player]] in the history of the Czech national team, with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|124 caps]]. He also represented his country at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], as well as the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]]. He was voted into the Euro 2004 All-Star team after helping the Czechs reach the semi-finals, and also served as the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]], prior to retiring from international competition in 2016. Čech also holds the record for the most [[Czech Footballer of the Year]] and [[Golden Ball (Czech Republic)|Czech Golden Ball]] wins. 
 
Considered one of the best goalkeepers of all time, Čech holds a number of goalkeeping records, including the [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] for fewest appearances required to reach 100 [[clean sheet]]s, having done so in 180 appearances, the most number of clean sheets in a season (24), as well as the record for the [[Premier League records and statistics#Goalkeepers|most clean sheets in Premier League history]] (202).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/2651/Petr-Cech/stats?co=1&amp;se=13|title=Petr Cech Statistics – 2004/05|accessdate=17 December 2017|work=premierleague.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paragraph Ten"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/2004-05|title=2004/05 Season Review|publisher=Premier League|date=n.d.|accessdate=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech is also the only goalkeeper to have won the [[Premier League Golden Glove]] with two separate clubs, and has won it a joint record four times; in [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]], [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]], [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] and the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16]]. He was voted the [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper]] in 2005, received the award of Best Goalkeeper in the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|2004–05]], [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08]] editions of the UEFA Champions League, and went 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal in 2004–05, which was also a Premier League record.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Plzeň]], Czechoslovakia, Čech started playing football aged seven for Škoda Plzeň (later known as [[FC Viktoria Plzeň|Viktoria Plzeň]]). In his early days, he played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], although he later moved to the goalkeeper position.&lt;ref name=dmaugust0809&gt;{{cite news | last=Pattenden | first=Mike | date=8 August 2009 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1204489/The-greatest-save-life-The-day-Chelseas-Petr-Cech-died.html | title=The greatest save of my life: The day Chelsea's Petr Cech almost died | newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] | accessdate=1 April 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech joined [[Czech First League]] team [[FK Chmel Blšany|Chmel Blšany]] in June 1999&lt;ref name=idnes20010131&gt;{{cite news | last=Štrunc | first=Robert | date=31 January 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-sni-o-barcelone-ale-zamiril-do-sparty-f17-/fotbal.aspx?c=A010131_093352_fotbal_rou | title = Čech sní o Barceloně, ale zamířil do Sparty |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his league debut at the age of 17 in October 1999, in a 3–1 loss against Sparta.&lt;ref name=dmaugust0809/&gt;&lt;ref name=idnes20010131/&gt;

Čech signed a {{frac|5|1|2}}-year contract with [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] at the age of 18 in January 2001, although he remained at Blšany until the end of [[2000–01 Czech First League|the 2000–01 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=29 January 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-jde-do-sparty-ktera-preplatila-bremy-fp7-/fotbal.aspx?c=A010129_143341_fotbal_bra | title = Čech jde do Sparty, která přeplatila Brémy |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2001, Čech broke the record formerly held by [[Theodor Reimann]] for the longest time elapsed without conceding a goal in the Czech professional league, stretching his run to 855 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 4 November 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/brankar-cech-si-hlidal-aby-mu-rekord-neutekl-fei-/fotbal.aspx?c=A011104_191941_fotbal_min | title=Brankář Čech si hlídal, aby mu rekord neutekl |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clean sheet record finally ended when he was beaten by a goal from [[Marcel Melecký]] of [[Bohemians 1905|Bohemians]] on 17 November 2001, ending his record at 903 consecutive minutes without conceding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Švéd | first = Jan | date = 14 July 2003 | url = http://fotbal.idnes.cz/rekordy-cech-nedostal-gol-903-minut-dl5-/fotbal.aspx?c=A030713_231554_fotbal_ruz | title = Rekordy: Čech nedostal gól 903 minut | language = Czech | work = Mladá fronta dnes | location = Czech Republic | publisher = Marfa | accessdate = 12 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Čech not winning the league title in the spring of 2002 with Sparta, he attracted interest from English clubs including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] due to his international performances. Due to difficulties in obtaining a work permit, however, a proposed deal with the ''Gunners'' fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/897742/petr-cech:-i-could-have-been-arsenal's-no.-1?cc=3436|title=Cech: Arsenal rejected me|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=3 April 2014|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rennes===
In July 2002, Čech moved to French club [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], signing a four-year contract for a transfer fee reported as [[Czech koruna|CZK]]150 million ([[Euro|€]]5.5&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Novák | first=Jaromír | date=9 July 2002 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-nejde-do-anglie-ale-do-rennes-do9-/fotbal.aspx?c=A020709_124905_fotbal_min | title=Čech nejde do Anglie, ale do Rennes |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[2002–03 Ligue 1|first season]] in France, he was awarded [[man of the match]] against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] by ''[[L'Équipe]]''.&lt;ref name=frenchmom&gt;{{cite news | date=22 May 2003 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-je-nejlepsim-golmanem-ve-francii-dsk-/fot_zahranici.aspx?c=A030522_105806_fot_zahranici_min | title=Čech je nejlepším gólmanem ve Francii |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, Rennes was at the bottom of the league table,&lt;ref name=frenchmom/&gt; yet escaped relegation with a win over [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] in the final matchday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=24 May 2003 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-vychytal-rennes-zachranu-dkb-/fot_zahranici.aspx?c=A030524_230756_fot_zahranici_min | title=Čech vychytal Rennes záchranu |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] made a transfer bid for Čech in January 2004 which was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3375791.stm |title=Chelsea Cech bid rejected |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 April 2008 | date=7 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in February Rennes agreed to Čech's move to Chelsea for [[Pound sterling|£]]7&amp;nbsp;million. Čech signed a five-year contract, to commence in July 2004, becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in Chelsea's history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3411707.stm |title=Chelsea sign Cech |work=BBC Sport | date=9 February 2004 | accessdate=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magicnumbers&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4470059.stm |title=Chelsea's magic numbers |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 April 2008 | date=30 April 2005 |first=Dan |last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech's was one amongst many British club transfers that came under the spotlight in the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football|2006 football corruption investigation]] for being potentially in breach of transfer regulations. The Stevens inquiry report, published in June 2007, found no evidence of illegal payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Drogba deal, Zihavi and five clubs in transfer spotlight | work= espnstar.com| date = 15 June 2007| url =http://espnstar.com/epl/epl_newsdetail_6191049.html|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071020210514/http://espnstar.com/epl/epl_newsdetail_6191049.html| archivedate =20 October 2007| accessdate =6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004–05 season====
When Čech arrived at Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini was established as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper. Cudicini, however, suffered a pre-season elbow injury that allowed Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] to promote Čech into the starting spot, where he became the first-choice goalkeeper in his first season. He kept a [[clean sheet]] in his [[Premier League]] debut in a 1–0 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cech content with debut |work=Sky Sports | url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/2308156/Cech-content-with-debut | accessdate =12 June 2013 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 March 2005, Čech set a new [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] of 1,025 minutes without letting in a goal, though his record has since been broken by Manchester United's [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Čech finally conceded to [[Leon McKenzie]] of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], after keeping a clean sheet in the league since 12 December 2004 when [[Thierry Henry]] scored for Arsenal.&lt;ref name=magicnumbers/&gt; Čech was given a special award by the Premier League for the new record, and he was also awarded the [[Premier League Golden Glove]] at the end of the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05 season]] for keeping a record 21 clean sheets in the Premier League.&lt;ref name=ext2008/&gt; The team, having conceded only 15 league goals in the entire season, also set a new record.

====2005–06 season====
Chelsea retained the Premier League title in the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06 season]], with Čech playing in 34 league matches. Chelsea conceded just 22 times during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =  English Premier League 2005–2006 : Table| work =  Statto.com| url =  http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2005-2006| accessdate =  17 August 2010| date =  17 August 2010| deadurl =  yes| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20120817022011/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2005-2006| archivedate =  17 August 2012| df =  dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, he was named the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics|IFFHS]] World's Best Goalkeeper for 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=19 January 2006 | url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/young-czech-football-goalkeeper-petr-cech-named-best-in-world | title=Young Czech football goalkeeper Petr Cech named best in world |work=Czech Radio |location=Czech Republic |last=Willoughby |first=Ian |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Čech signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2010.&lt;ref name=ext2006&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2331566/Cech-rewarded-for-Chelsea-record-with-contract-to-2010.html |title=Cech rewarded for Chelsea record with contract to 2010 |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Johnson |first=William }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named the [[Czech Footballer of the Year]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=27 February 2006 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/brankar-cech-poprve-fotbalistou-roku-dwg-/fot_reprez.aspx?c=A060227_174522_fot_reprez_mn | title=Brankář Čech poprvé Fotbalistou roku |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robbencech.jpg|thumb|250px|Čech and [[Arjen Robben]] celebrate their second Premier League title in 2006.]]

====2006–07 season====
Čech underwent minor shoulder surgery on 27 June 2006 to repair a long-standing injury stemming from the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Keeper Cech has shoulder surgery |work=BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/5119818.stm | accessdate =6 September 2007 | date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to action on 27 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blackburn 0–2 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5266318.stm | accessdate =6 September 2007 | date=27 August 2006 | first=John | last=Sinnott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Head injury====
Čech sustained a head injury in the match against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the [[Madejski Stadium]] on 14 October 2006 when he collided with Reading midfielder [[Stephen Hunt (footballer, born 1981)|Stephen Hunt]] inside Chelsea's penalty area within the first minute of a Premier League match. Hunt's right knee hit Čech's head, leaving the goalkeeper requiring treatment.&lt;ref name=headinj&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/15/match.chelsea |title=Rattled Chelsea get better of Reading after keeper crisis |date=15 October 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |work=The Guardian  |location=London |last=Lawrence |first=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech was taken off after several minutes and replaced by Carlo Cudicini, who himself was knocked unconscious later in the same game, forcing Chelsea captain [[John Terry]] to play in goal for the match's remaining minutes.&lt;ref name=headinj/&gt; Čech underwent surgery for a [[skull fracture|depressed skull fracture]].&lt;ref name="BBC Cech surgery"&gt;{{cite news | date=15 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6053244.stm | title=Keeper Cech has surgery on skull |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially unaware of the seriousness of the injury, the doctors later reported that it nearly cost Čech his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cross | first=John | date=28 October 2006 | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=i-ll-be-back&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18005566&amp;siteid=94762-name_page.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020024939/http://mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline%3Di-ll-be-back%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18005566%26siteid%3D94762-name_page.html | archivedate=20 October 2007 | title=I'LL BE BACK | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | accessdate=18 March 2012 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of the collision, he suffered intense headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=16 October 2006 | url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2006/October/16/doctors-cech-out-for-rest-of-season | title=Doctors: Cech out for rest of season | work=soccerway.com | accessdate=16 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103222/http://www.soccerway.com/news/2006/October/16/doctors-cech-out-for-rest-of-season | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea manager José Mourinho blamed Hunt for Čech's injury, saying that his challenge was "a disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=14 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6052028.stm | title=Mourinho angry as keepers injured |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the South Central Ambulance Service [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/reading-and-nhs-failed-cech-claims-mourinho-420484.html |title=Reading and NHS failed Cech, claims Mourinho |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |work=The Independent  |last=Wallace |first=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt; and match referee [[Mike Riley (referee)|Mike Riley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=16 October 2006 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=410707&amp;in_page_id=1779 | title=Referee Riley: I did not make Cech leave the pitch for treatment | newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] | accessdate=21 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of commentators, including current and former goalkeepers, saw the incident as highlighting the need for greater protection for goalkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=17 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6057730.stm | title=Wenger fears for keepers' safety |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=19 October 2006 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/gabriele_marcotti/10/19/cech.keepers/index.html | title=English head games |work=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Čech was able to return home on 24 October 2006 and participated in light training the following week. Chelsea, however, announced that the goalkeeper would be out for three months, in line with medical advice on the time needed for complete recovery from the skull fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 October 2006|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/article.asp?hlid=424212&amp;m=10&amp;y=2006&amp;nav=news&amp;sub=latest+news|title=Cech home and set to train|work=chelseafc.com|accessdate=25 October 2006}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Čech said that he had no memory of the injury itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/27/newsstory.sport8|title=I don't remember Hunt collision, admits Cech|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=30 September 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return====
[[File:Petr Cech.jpg|thumb|left|Čech playing for Chelsea in 2007]]
Čech made his comeback in a Premier League match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 January 2007, which Chelsea eventually lost 2–0, wearing a [[scrum cap|rugby style headguard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6258681.stm |title=Liverpool 2–0 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date= 20 January 2007|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by [[Canterbury of New Zealand]] and carrying the manufacturer's logo. This caused friction with Czech national team sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]] and Chelsea's apparel manufacturer [[Adidas]]. The matter was resolved after the latter sponsor developed its own headgear for Čech to wear in club matches, while the player went on to wear an unbranded cap for national team games.&lt;ref name=sponsor2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/3701996/Petr-Cech-follows-Zinedine-Zidane-in-sponsorship-deal-Football.html |title=Petr Cech follows Zinedine Zidane in sponsorship deal |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |last=Benammar |first=Emily }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even long after his injuries healed completely, Čech has continued to wear the cap to his matches.

Although Chelsea lost Čech's comeback match, he then went approximately 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. On 11 April 2007, Čech was awarded the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for the first time in his career, in recognition of his eight successive league clean sheets. He was the first goalkeeper to receive the award since [[Tim Flowers]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 April 2007 |url=http://www.czech.cz/en/news/sport/petr-cech-named-player-of-the-month/ |title=Petr Cech named player of the month |work=czech.cz |accessdate=6 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012333/http://www.czech.cz/en/news/sport/petr-cech-named-player-of-the-month/ |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This run was ended during a 4–1 Chelsea victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 18 April 2007 when [[Carlos Tevez]] scored against him.

Čech also kept a clean sheet for Chelsea in the [[2007 FA Cup Final|2007 FA Cup final]] against Manchester United. He and United's Edwin van der Sar shared the honour of being the first goalkeepers to keep a clean sheet over 90 minutes in a competitive fixture at the new [[Wembley Stadium]], but Čech became the first goalkeeper to end a competitive game unbeaten, as Chelsea beat United 1–0 to win the FA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6649815.stm |title=Chelsea 1–0 Manchester United |work=BBC Sport |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie |date= 19 May 2007|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007–08 season====
[[File:Petr Čech.jpg|thumb|right|Čech training for Chelsea in 2008]]
Čech started the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]] conceding two goals against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the first match of the season. Despite this, Chelsea managed to win 3–2 and set an English record for their 64th consecutive unbeaten league match at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=221289&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ENG.1 |title=Report: Chelsea vs Birmingham – English Premier League |work=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Čech suffered an injury to his right calf muscle in the 0–0 [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage|UEFA Champions League group stage]] match at [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref name=inj2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8841884.stm |title=Chelsea keeper Petr Cech may miss Premier League start  |work=BBC Sport |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on 23 December 2007, he had to be replaced during a match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] due to a hip injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7145750.stm |title=Blackburn 0–1 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea suffered its first major blow when it lost the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with Čech [[parrying]] the ball onto [[Jonathan Woodgate]]'s head for the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=235283&amp;cc=5901 |title=Report: Tottenham vs Chelsea – English Carling Cup |work=ESPNsoccernet |date=24 February 2008 | accessdate = 9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in several games until the eve of Chelsea's home Champions League tie with Greek champions [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] when he injured his ankle in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/03/06/sfnche206.xml |title=Petr Cech hit by injury setback |date=6 March 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Ley |first=John |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508205418/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2008%2F03%2F06%2Fsfnche206.xml |archivedate=8 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11945_3243941,00.html |title=Cech suffers ankle injury |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks that followed, Čech missed key games of Chelsea's campaign, including the [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|derby with Arsenal]] and both legs of the Champions League quarter-final.

On 7 April 2008, it was announced that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on his chin and lips following an accidental collision with [[Tal Ben Haim]] during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7334884.stm |title=Chelsea ready to risk keeper Cech |work=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=523722&amp;cc=5901 |title=Cech out for two weeks after fifty stitch operation |work=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin and missed 22 games due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goalies find their fate in coaches' hands| author=Rob Hughes|work=International Herald Tribune| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/08/sports/SOCCER.1.php| date =8 April 2008| accessdate =8 April 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].

====2008–09 season====
[[File:Petr Cech training.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Čech before Chelsea's first game of the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09]] season against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]]]
Čech signed a new five-year contract in July 2008 to keep him at Chelsea until 2013.&lt;ref name=ext2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/2437931/Petr-Cech-signs-five-year-extension-at-Chelsea-with-Michael-Essien-set-to-follow.html |title=Petr Cech signs five-year extension at Chelsea with Michael Essien set to follow |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Wilson |first=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea started the [[2008–09 Chelsea F.C. season|2008–09 season]] in good form, conceding only 7 goals in 17 games and keeping 11 clean sheets, 10 of which with Čech in goal.

In November 2008, Chelsea beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 5–0 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], a game which marked the 100th match Čech had played for Chelsea without conceding a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/09/premier-league-chelsea-blackburn |title=Cech the century maker makes case for defence |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2009 |work=The Guardian  |location=London |last=Castles |first=Duncan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea had a 1–0 victory over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] on his 200th appearance for the club, and he also starred in a 1–0 away victory at [[Villa Park]] against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], saving from [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]] and [[Gareth Barry]]. The following week, Čech helped Chelsea move up to second place in the league by saving from [[Paul Scharner]] in the first half against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea won 2–1. Successive clean sheets by Čech in Chelsea's wins against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] saw his side consolidate their position in the Premier League whilst progressing into the [[2008–09 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals. Čech also made saves from [[Dirk Kuyt]] and [[Xabi Alonso]] as Chelsea beat Liverpool 3–1 at [[Anfield]] in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals.

In a crucial Premier League game in April 2009, with Chelsea comfortably leading 4–0 against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], Chelsea manager [[Guus Hiddink]] took off both [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Frank Lampard]] only for Bolton to score three late goals which questioned the Chelsea defence, and in particular Čech. Čech, however, responded when he saved a penalty from [[Mark Noble]] in Chelsea's 1–0 win at the [[Boleyn Ground]] against West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham 0–1 Chelsea |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8000577.stm|accessdate=14 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept a clean sheet in the next game against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] during the Champions League semi-final first leg match. Following a 3–2 win against Sunderland at the [[Stadium of Light]], Čech and Chelsea finished the season with the joint-tightest defence in the Premier League along with Manchester United, having conceded just 24 goals over the course of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/table/default.stm |title=Premier League table |date=24 May 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2009 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite conceding the fastest goal in [[List of FA Cup finals|FA Cup final]] history, Čech helped Chelsea's [[2009 FA Cup Final|2009 FA Cup final]] triumph over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Chelsea won 2–1, earning the Czech his seventh trophy at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8060989.stm |title=Chelsea 2–1 Everton |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2009 |work=BBC Sport |last=Bevan |first=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chelsea coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] accused Čech, [[Michael Ballack]] and Drogba of causing his sacking, saying that they "did not accept my training methods or my demands". Scolari also said that it stemmed from a row between him and the Czech goalkeeper over the latter's alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was "disappointed with [Scolari] because never in my life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/06/petr-cech-carlo-ancelotti-chelsea |title=Petr Cech says Carlo Ancelotti is "ideal" man for Chelsea |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |work=The Guardian  |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Čech began the [[2009–10 Chelsea F.C. season|2009–10 season]] in winning form with Chelsea, beating Manchester United in the [[2009 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] final at Wembley. With the game level at 2–2 at the end of normal time, Čech saved penalties from [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Patrice Evra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8190061.stm |title=Chelsea 2 – 2 Man Utd |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |work=BBC Sport |last=McNulty |first=Phil }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Čech kept goal for Chelsea in the six-match winning run that opened their season and placed them on top of the [[2009–10 Premier League|Premier League]].

On 18 March 2014, Čech made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–0 win over [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] at Stamford Bridge. He became the fourth goalkeeper to make a century of appearances in the competition after [[Iker Casillas]], [[Victor Valdés]] and [[Oliver Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2068181.html|title=Čech becomes latest member of 100 club|date=18 March 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2014, Čech was substituted in the first leg of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final against Atlético Madrid with a shoulder injury. Chelsea manager José Mourinho stated that the injury would prevent Čech from playing again in the [[2013–14 Chelsea F.C. season|2013–14 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27121526|title=Chelsea: John Terry &amp; Petr Cech injured for Premier League run-in|date=22 April 2014|accessdate=23 April 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the injury, Čech would finish the season as the joint winner of the Premier League Golden Glove award along with Arsenal goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]], both keeping 16 clean sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/liverpool-star-suarez-named-barclays-player-season-14051390935 |title=Liverpool star Suarez named Barclays Player of the Season |publisher=talksport |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Čech's place as Chelsea's starting goalkeeper was taken at the start of the season by [[Thibaut Courtois]]. This was possibly due to Čech's long standing injury concerns to his shoulder, back and knees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2051245/Petr-Cech-Chelsea-future-doubt-says-Thibaut-Courtois.html|title=Time's running out for Cech: Rookie Courtois casts doubt over keeper's future|publisher=Daily Mail|date=20 October 2011|accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2014, Čech made his first appearance of the season against Bolton in the third round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], a 2–1 victory.

Despite him being second choice, Mourinho stated that Čech would not be sold in the January 2015 transfer window due to third-choice [[Mark Schwarzer]] leaving for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea as Mark Schwarzer joins Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30675920|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that month, Čech made back to back starts in the Premier League against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at home, followed by [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] away from home, keeping clean-sheets in both wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea 2–0 Newcastle|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/395574/statistics.html|work=ESPN|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City 0–5 Chelsea |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/395563/statistics.html|work=ESPN|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2015, Čech started in goal in the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup final]] against Tottenham Hotspur, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory to win the trophy for the third time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/01/chelsea-tottenham-capital-one-cup-final-match-report|title=Terry drives Chelsea to Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham|date=1 March 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

{{wikinews|Petr Čech retires from international football}}
Čech first represented his country in November 1997 with the under-15 team, working his way up through different age groups before making his senior debut for the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in February 2002. He first came to prominence as a 20-year-old at the [[2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2002 U-21 European Championships]] when his [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] heroics in the final against [[France national under-21 football team|France]], letting in only one of the penalty kicks, earned the [[Czech Republic national under-21 football team|Czech Republic]] their first title at youth level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Čech sparks Czech party|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/history/season=2002/index.html|publisher=UEFA|date=1 June 2002|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing himself as the senior team's first choice goalkeeper, Čech was selected in the Czech Republic's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. Čech's saves helped his team progress as far as the semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on the [[silver goal]] rule. He was named in the all-star team as best goalkeeper at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC Sport|title=Zagorakis named top player|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/greece/3866823.stm|date=5 July 2004|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech Republic qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], held in Germany, and were placed in Group E, alongside [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. The Czech Republic finished third in their group, following a 3–0 win against the United States, and two losses against Ghana and Italy, the score 2–0 in both games, thus not qualifying for the knock-out stages of the tournament.

On 17 October 2007, Čech captained the Czech Republic team in their [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] Group D qualifier against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. He kept a clean sheet and the Czechs defeated Germany 3–0 away to book their place for the finals in Austria and Switzerland. In the last group game of the final tournament, Čech was beaten three times in the final 15 minutes as [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] overcame a two-goal deficit to knock the Czechs out. Čech had a cross slip through his hands, allowing [[Nihat Kahveci]] to score Turkey's equalizing goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Euro 2008: Petr Cech blames himself for Czech Republic's spectacular collapse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/2303385/Euro-2008-Petr-Cech-blames-himself-for-Czech-Republics-spectacular-collapse.html|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=13 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Héctor Bellerín Moruno''' ({{IPA-es|ˈeɣtoɾ βeʎeˈɾim moˈɾuno}},{{efn|In isolation, ''Bellerín'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|beʎeˈɾin|}}.}} born 19 March 1995) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing back]]  for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Spanish national football team|Spain national team]].

Bellerín started his career as an attacking winger for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and credits his development as a successful right back to [[Steve Bould]] upon his arrival at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3341454/Hector-Bellerin-didn-t-know-defend-Barcelona-schooled-Arsenal-legend-Steve-Bould.html|title=Arsenal star Hector Bellerin 'didn't know how to defend' at Barcelona|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speedy pace, skilful [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] on the ball, and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability have also helped him in creating chances for his team. On 21 November 2016, he signed a long-term contract that ties him to the club until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.in/football/arsenal/story/3000954/hector-bellerin-signs-new-long-term-contract-at-arsenal|title=Bellerin signs new long-term Arsenal deal|newspaper=ESPN|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellerín played internationally for Spain from [[Spain national under-16 football team|under-16]] to [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels. He made his [[Spain national football team|senior]] debut for Spain in 2016 and was later chosen for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|European Championship]] of that year.&lt;ref name=Euros /&gt;

== International career ==
Having reached the semi-finals of the [[2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2013 European Championship]] with the [[Spain national under-19 football team|under-19 team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefutbol.com/en/future-theirs-hector-bellerin-speed-embodied-footballer|title=The Future is theirs: Héctor Bellerín, speed embodied in a footballer|publisher=Real Federación Española de Fútbol|date=16 May 2015|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellerín made his debut for [[Albert Celades]]'s [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] on 30 March 2015, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–0 friendly win over Belarus in [[León, Spain|León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefutbol.com/en/match-report-spains-u21-xxx|title=MATCH REPORT: Spain thrashes Belarus (4–0)|publisher=Real Federación Española de Fútbol|first=Antonio D.|last=Muñoz|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403055342/http://www.sefutbol.com/en/match-report-spains-u21-xxx|archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2016, after being named as a stand-by player for [[UEFA Euro 2016|the year's European Championship]], Bellerín made his debut for [[Spain national football team|the full squad]] by starting in a 3–1 friendly win against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] at the [[AFG Arena]] in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-hector-bellerin-makes-spain-8078047|title=Arsenal's Hector Bellerin makes Spain debut as defending champions warm up for Euro 2016 with a win|work=Daily Mirror|date=29 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he was chosen for the final squad after [[Dani Carvajal]] withdrew through injury.&lt;ref name=Euros&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36416575|title=Euro 2016: Arsenal's Hector Bellerin in Spain squad after injury forces out Dani Carvajal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unused as they reached the last 16.

== Style of play ==
&lt;!-- Do not add that he is faster than Usain Bolt, or that his 40&amp;nbsp;m time is 4.41 seconds. See the talk page for why this is incorrect--&gt;Bellerín is known for his pace, which allows him to take on opposition defenders as well as provide defensive cover. At the beginning of the [[2014–15 Arsenal F.C. season|2014–15 season]], he broke [[Theo Walcott]]'s 40-metre Arsenal sprint record by 1/100th of a second. He is considered to be one of the fastest footballers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20150513/bellerin-the-secret-to-my-speed|title=Bellerin – The secret to my speed|last=Jones|first=Max|date=13 May 2015|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like teammates [[Sead Kolasinac]] and [[Nacho Monreal]], he has received more praise for his attacking abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/dream-team/fantasy-football/8217912/fantasy-football-tips-premier-league-hector-bellerin-arsenal-game-week-21/|title=Hector Bellerin is fully fit and ready to give you a Dream Team selection headache|last=161385360554578|date=2019-01-17|website=The Sun|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2018-19 season, Unai Emery has often employed him as a wing-back. 

== Personal life ==
Bellerín became a [[vegan]] in 2017, which he credits for improving his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 January 2019|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/premier-league/dieta-hector-bellerin-para-evitar-lesiones-6725295|title=La dieta de Héctor Bellerín para evitar lesiones|language=es|website=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|publicationdate=30 March 2018|first=Jonathan |last=Moreno|deadurl=no|archivedate=3 January 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103163903/https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/premier-league/dieta-hector-bellerin-para-evitar-lesiones-6725295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===AEK Athens===
Papastathopoulos joined AEK Athens from &lt;!--Red link [[Apollon Petalidiou]]--&gt;Apollon Petalidiou after being scouted by [[Toni Savevski]]. On 26 October 2005, he made his debut for AEK in a [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] match against [[PAS Giannina F.C.|PAS Giannina]], scoring in the seventh minute of the game to help lead AEK to a 3–0 win.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Niki Volou (loan)====
In January 2006, he was loaned to [[Second Division (Greece)|Greek Second Division]] club [[Niki Volos F.C.|Niki Volou]] for six months in order to gain first-team football and gather valuable experience. He made a total of 15 appearances for Niki Volou.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====AEK Athens return====
During the [[2006-07 Superleague Greece]], Papastathopoulos managed to make 14 appearances whilst competing against the likes of [[Bruno Cirillo]], [[Traianos Dellas]] and [[Vangelis Moras]]. In AEK Athens' [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League]] campaign, Papastathopoulos managed to play in three out of six group games. In these three games, AEK managed one win (the famous 1–0 victory over [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], where he man-marked [[Filippo Inzaghi]]), one draw (the 2–2 away draw with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]) and one loss (the 3–1 away defeat to [[Lille OSC|Lille]]). During the [[2007–08 Superleague Greece]], he was a mainstay in AEK's defence, keeping out competition from [[Geraldo Alves (footballer, born 1980)|Geraldo Alves]]. He also played in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08 Champions League]] campaign, and in a Superleague match, he became AEK's youngest-ever captain, at age 19, in a game against local [[Athens]] rivals [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Genoa===
On 1 August 2008, Papastathopoulos agreed to transfer to [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] of the Italian [[Serie A]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4314|script-title=el:Ανακοίνωση|trans-title=Communication|date= 1 August 2008|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=AEK Athens F.C. |language=Greek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805100628/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4314|archivedate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a club friendly against Genoa on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.genoacfc.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5291&amp;Itemid=31|title=IL GENOA DA' LEZIONE DI GRECO|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=Genoa C.F.C. |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut for Genoa on 27 September 2008 against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], followed by a start against [[Ravenna Calcio|Ravenna]] in the [[Coppa Italia]] a few days later. His first goal for Genoa came on 5 October 2008 at home against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. Genoa won the game 3–2, but Papastathopoulos was sent off in the 89th minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/soccer/report?gameId=251286|title=Genoa vs. Napoli – Football Match Report – October 5, 2008 |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251286&amp;&amp;cc=5739 | title = Genoa 3–2 Napoli |website=ESPN Soccernet | date = 5 October 2008 | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], he managed to play in most games and became somewhat of a fan favourite.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Milan===
On 20 July 2010, it was confirmed on [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]'s website that Papastathopoulos had joined the team, after Genoa and Milan reached an agreement to transfer Papastathopoulos to the club for €14&amp;nbsp;million, with the following payment schedule: [[Gianmarco Zigoni]] (half of his registration rights, valued at €3.75&amp;nbsp;million), [[Nnamdi Oduamadi]] (half of his rights, valued at €3.5&amp;nbsp;million) and [[Rodney Strasser]] (half of his rights, valued at €2.25&amp;nbsp;million) in a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership deal]], plus €4.5&amp;nbsp;million in funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome Sokratis! |url=http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail.aspx?idNews=124929 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724033155/http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail.aspx?idNews=124929 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |publisher=A.C.

====Genoa return====
On 24 May 2011, Milan and Genoa executives [[Adriano Galliani]] and [[Enrico Preziosi]], respectively, formed a verbal agreement to solve the player ownerships (subject to player agreements) of [[Kevin-Prince Boateng]], [[Alberto Paloschi]], [[Marco Amelia]] and [[Giacomo Beretta]]. The deal entailed that Milan bought back Gianmarco Zigoni, Rodney Strasser and Nnamdi Oduamadi (all under original price),&lt;ref name=Genoa2011bilancio/&gt; while Genoa bought back Papastathopoulos for €13&amp;nbsp;million, which effectively made the ''de facto'' loan cost for Milan €1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Genoa2011bilancio&gt;{{cite book|title= Genoa CFC SpA Report and Accounts on 31 December 2011  | date =  April 2012|publisher= registroimprese.it/ CCIAA Archive | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acmilan.com/uploads/club/bilancio2011/ | title = Relazione e Bilancio al 31 Dicembre 2011 | language = Italian | publisher = Ac milan | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2011/maggio/25/Boateng_del_Milan_Riscatto_milioni_ga_10_110525107.shtml|title=Boateng e del Milan Riscatto da 7 milioni|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Werder Bremen===
[[File:Sokratis Papastathopoulos 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Papastathopoulos with [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in 2012]]

On 21 July 2011, Papastathopoulos moved to German club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] on a loan deal until the end of the [[2011–12 SV Werder Bremen season|2011–12 season]], with the option to purchase outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.werder.de/en/aktuell/news/34406.php|title=Sokratis introduced|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=SV Werder Bremen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518171636/http://www.werder.de/en/aktuell/news/34406.php|archivedate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2011/07/21/2584535/official-sokratis-papastathopoulos-joins-werder-bremen-on|title=Official: Sokratis Papastathopoulos joins Werder Bremen on loan from Genoa|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/936169/werder-bremen-swoop-for-papastathopoulos-on-loan-from-genoa?cc=3888|title=Bremen swoop for Papastathopoulos|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|website=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following impressive performances on loan, on 16 April 2012, it was announced that Papastathopoulos would join Bremen on a permanent basis for a €5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1615865.html|title=Papastathopoulos makes Bremen move permanent|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/04/16/papastathopoulos-completes-bremen-switch/|title=Papastathopoulos completes Bremen switch|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Genoa CFC SpA Report and Accounts on 31 December 2012 |publisher= registroimprese.it/ CCIAA Archive | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2012–13 SV Werder Bremen season|2012–13 season]], however, was not a good one for the club. In March 2013, in the midst of a relegation battle and with tensions high, Papastathopoulos engaged in a training ground brawl with teammate [[Marko Arnautović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/29/werder-bremen-stars-show-strain-of-relegation-battle-with-petulant-training-ground-brawl-3565176/|title=Werder Bremen stars show strain of relegation battle with petulant training ground brawl|date=29 March 2013|newspaper=Metro|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremen would ultimately finish the year in 14th, staving-off relegation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Borussia Dortmund===
On 24 May 2013, the eve of the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final|2013 Champions League Final]] between [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]], Papastathopoulos completed a €9.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer to Dortmund, agreeing to a five-year contract through to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvb.de/?%87%ECY%1B%E7%F4%9C%5Ch%E2%81%99 | title = BVB sign "Sokratis" | publisher = Borussia Dortmund | date = 28 May 2013 | accessdate = 28 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/upegrapse-sti-ntortmoud-o-swkratis/677300 | title = Υπέγραψε στην Ντόρτμουντ ο Σωκράτης! | publisher = sport-fm.gr| date = 23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvs.org/sokratis-papastathopoulos-vs-msakni/|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos vs Msakni – Football VS – Real football face to face|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing, he spoke about the deal, saying, "Money did not play a role in my decision to join Dortmund. My own future was all that mattered and I am convinced that I made the right decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4016/main/2013/06/05/4027048/sokratis-i-did-not-join-dortmund-for-the-money|title=Sokratis: I did not join Dortmund for the money |website=Goal.com | date = 5 June 2013 | accessdate = 28 July 2013 | first = Stefan | last = Coerts}}&lt;/ref&gt; With centre-back [[Felipe Santana]] departing Dortmund for [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], Papastathopoulos began as the effective third-choice behind tandem [[Neven Subotić]] and [[Mats Hummels]]. Borussia Dortmund Sporting Director [[Michael Zorc]] expressed his satisfaction with the deal: "We are delighted that Sokratis has decided to join Borussia Dortmund. He is a flexible player capable to play in a variety of positions in defence who we believe has tremendous potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/borussia-dortmund/transfer-talk/news/papastathopoulos-joins-dortmund_86480.html|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos joins Borussia Dortmund | publisher = sportsmole.co.uk| date = 28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2013, Papastathopoulos made his debut for Dortmund in a pre-season friendly away to Swiss club [[FC Basel|Basel]] at [[St. Jakob-Park]], along with fellow BVB debutants [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] and [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]]. On 27 July, he won his first title with the club after entering the match as a substitute in a 4–2 win over Bayern Munich for the [[2013 DFL-Supercup|2013]] [[DFL-Supercup]].&lt;ref name=goaldotcom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thefinalball.com/jogo.php?id=2821403|title=DFL SuperCup Final 2013| publisher = footballzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2013, he scored his first goal for Dortmund in a 6–1 win over [[VfB Stuttgart]] in the [[Bundesliga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2013/0000276334.php|title=Lewandowski shines as Stuttgart hit for six|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105001353/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2013/0000276334.php|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papastathopoulos' strong first year with Dortmund was rewarded with his selection to the best XI of the [[2013–14 Bundesliga]] campaign. The selection was organized in a worldwide fan vote by the governing body of the Bundesliga through its official website. The description of his play following his nomination was, "The definition of defense falls on him. The Greek stopper took advantage of the opportunities given to him by the absence of Neven Subotić and Mats Hummels. Stable, with leadership characteristics and tendency to win the ball without making easily a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.protothema.gr/sports/article/374148/stin-kaluteri-11ada-tou-germanikou-protathlimatos-o-sokratis-papastathopoulos/|title=Στην καλύτερη 11άδα του Γερμανικού Πρωταθλήματος ο Σωκράτης Παπασταθόπουλος| publisher = protothema.gr | date = 28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/fanzone/team-of-the-season/|title=Team of the season|publisher=Bundesliga|date=23 April 2014|access-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412230941/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/fanzone/team-of-the-season/|archive-date=12 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Papastathopoulos was ruled out of action for two weeks with a broken fibula. He suffered the injury to his right leg in Dortmund's 1–0 win over [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], a result that ended a five-match Bundesliga losing streak for the club. After recovering early, he was deemed fit for BVB's [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 26 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/dortmunds-sokratis-sidelined-two-weeks#:z5zDXxiyWaOC0A |title=Dortmund's Sokratis sidelined for two weeks| publisher = fourfourtwo.com | date = 10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2015, football news website Goal.com assessed statistics to determine which players maintained the highest tackle success rate in the first half of the 2014–15 season across Europe's top five leagues; Papastathopoulos finished joint-third, alongside [[Hamburger SV]]'s [[Matthias Ostrzolek]], having won 92.59 percent of all tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2015/01/03/7608302/who-is-the-best-tackler-in-europe-this-season|title=Who is the best tackler in Europe this season?| website = Goal.com| date = 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2015, Papastathopoulos was linked with moves to various English [[Premier League]] clubs as Dortmund prepared for a new start following long-time manager [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s departure. Dortmund Sporting Director [[Michael Zorc]], however, said Papastathopoulos would still have a part to play for BVB in new manager [[Thomas Tuchel]]'s debut season with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pulse.ng/sports/football/borussia-dortmund-michael-zorc-quells-rumours-over-sokratis-papastathopoulos-and-sven-bender-id3890196.html|title=MIchael Zorc quells rumours over Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Sven Bender| publisher = pulse.ng| date = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2015, Papastathopoulos extended his contract with Borussia Dortmund until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/725/bundesliga/2015/10/26/16696102/sokratis-extends-dortmund-contract|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos extends Borussia Dortmund contract |website=Goal.com |date=26 October 2015|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2015, Papastathopoulos scored his first goal in the [[2015–16 Bundesliga]] in an eventual 2–1 away loss to [[1. FC Köln]], giving his club the lead in the first-half from a header from a corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/blmd17n-1-fc-koeln-2-1-borussia-dortmund-report.jsp|title=BLMD17 – 1.

On 22 February 2016, Papastathopoulos missed the second leg of the [[UEFA Europa League]] round-of-32 tie against [[FC Porto]] and the Bundesliga clash with [[Bayern Munich]] due to an adductor injury, as tests confirmed that the 27-year-old would be out for up to three weeks.

He started the [[2016-17 Bundesliga|2016–17 season]] as the undisputed leader in BVB defence. On 15 September 2016, he netted the second goal in an away crashing 6–0 against [[Legia Warsaw]] on a Group [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2017/matches/round=2000783/match=2019293/postmatch/report/index.html?rss=2400199%20Dortmund%20six-shooters%20wreck%20Legia's%20comeback|title=UEFA Champions League – Legia-Dortmund – Dortmund six-shooters wreck Legia's comeback – UEFA|last=UEFA.com|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2017 the German magazine ''"Kicker"'' listed the Greek international as one of the best players in the German [[Bundesliga]]. The magazine paid a tribute to the best players currently playing in the German Bundesliga, separating them out into different categories. In the first category (World Class) no defenders were listed, however, Papastathopoulos was one of three defenders listed in the second category, International Class.

On 8 February 2017, in a [[DFB Pokal]] home win on penalties' game against [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]], Papastathopoulos' two quickfire (in a minute) bookings for dissent saw Dortmund finish extra time with 10 men before [[Fabian Lustenberger]], [[Vladimir Darida]] and [[Salomon Kalou]] all erred from the spot, rendering [[Christian Pulisic]]'s miss irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/german-dfb-pokal/story/3056496/borussia-dortmund-reach-pokal-quarters-after-shootout-with-hertha-schalke-win |title=Dortmund reach Pokal quarters after shootout with Hertha; Schalke win |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2017, Dortmund made three changes from last weekend's 3–0 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg]] and it was two of those, Papastathopoulos and [[Raphael Guerreiro]], who combined to open the scoring in the 13th minute in a 3–0 away win against [[SC Freiburg]]. Papastathopoulos looked to be offside as Guerreiro swung in a free-kick from the right, which the Greece defender met with a header planted inside the right-hand post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/1051478/kollise-o-sokratis-vid |title=Το κόλλησε ο Σωκράτης  |publisher=gazzetta.gr |accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2016-17/22/3317450/spielbericht_sc-freiburg-7_borussia-dortmund-17.html |title=Freiburg vs Dortmund 0–3  |publisher=kicker.de |accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 16 April 2017, Papastathopoulos was the one who had a quick reaction to a [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] equalizing, by scoring a goal after [[Sven Bender]]'s assist giving a lead to the score in his team in a final 3–1 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2016-17/29/3317506/spielbericht_borussia-dortmund-17_eintracht-frankfurt-32.html |title=Dortmund vs Eintracht 3–1  |publisher=kicker.de |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 26 April 2017, helped Borussia Dortmund to a 3–2 win over [[Bayern Munich]] and their fourth consecutive [[DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal final]]. On 20 May 2017, Papastathopoulos reached 100 appearances with Dortmund in [[Bundesliga]] in a home game against [[SV Werder Bremen]] and secured automatic qualification to the group stage of next season's [[UEFA Champions League]]. On 27 May 2017, in his fourth [[DFB-Pokal]] in a row, Borussia Dortmund claimed a first DFB-Pokal win since 2012 as [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]]'s penalty defeated [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearthewall.com/2017/5/27/15705332/dfb-pokal-match-report-dortmund-wins-a-title |title=DFB Pokal Match Report: Dortmund wins a title |publisher=fearthewall.com |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/sport/dortmund-pokalsieger-101.html |title=Borussia Dortmund gewinnt DFB-Pokal |publisher=tagesschau.de |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2017, as the captain of the club, he lost the [[2017 DFL-Supercup]] on penalties' game against [[Bayern Munich]]. On 17 September 2017, he scored at the end of the first half against [[1. FC Köln]], giving a lead of two goals in his club. It was his first goal for the [[2017-18 Bundesliga|2017–18 season]] and was secured with the use of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/EllinesExoterikou/gkol-toy-papastathopoyloy-kontra-sthn-kolwnia-me-xrhsh-toy-var.4850517.html |title=Γκολ του Παπασταθόπουλου κόντρα στην Κολωνία με χρήση του VAR! |publisher=sport24.gr |accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2017, Borussia Dortmund's unbeaten start to the season was ended by [[RB Leipzig]]'s 3–2 away win, as the Greek defender initially in trying to push the ball away helped Leipzig winger [[Yussuf Poulsen]] to score, while at the beginning of second half, was sent off for a foul in the box and [[Jean-Kevin Augustin]] scored the penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Columns/contra-epithesi/dortmund/me-gkafa-papastathopoyloy-anatroph-h-leipsia.4891149.html |title=Με γκάφα Παπασταθόπουλου ανατροπή η Λειψία |publisher=contra.gr |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 2017, after losing its [[UEFA Champions League]] opening games in Group H to [[Tottenham]] and [[Real Madrid]], Dortmund needed a win to kick-start its campaign in Europe's premier club competition, but they succeeded only to seal an away draw against Cypriot champions [[APOEL]], as the Greek defender equalized with a header to [[Mario Götze]]'s cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2017/10/17/39500952/apoel-1-borussia-dortmund-1-sokratis-header-spares-burkis |title=APOEL vs Borussia Dortmund 1–1 |website=Goal.com |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/champions-league-roundup-apoel-borussia-dortmund-draw |title=Champions League roundup: Borussia Dortmund held to draw by Apoel |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2017, in the derby against rivals [[Bayern Munich]] he suffered a leg injury, during the first half, and was substituted by [[Jeremy Toljan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/traymatisthke-o-papastathopoylos-agwnia-gia-thn-ethnikh-elladas.4922818.html |title=Τραυματίστηκε ο Παπασταθόπουλος, αγωνία για την Εθνική Ελλάδας |publisher=sport24.gr |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two weeks later in an away game against [[VfB Stuttgart]] has received a heavy blow and replaced at the end of the first half from [[Dan-Axel Zagadou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/as-it-happened-stuttgart-2-1-borussia-dortmund/a-41430252 |title=As it happened: Stuttgart 2–1 Borussia Dortmund |publisher=dw.com |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
On 2 July 2018, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] announced that Papastathopoulos has agreed a long-term contract with the club for a reported fee £17.6 million and will wear the number 5 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/sokratis-papastathopoulos-signs|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos signs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2778354-sokratis-papastathopoulos-completes-arsenal-transfer-for-reported-176m-fee|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos Completes Arsenal Transfer for Reported £17.6M Fee}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2018, he made his official debut with the club as a starter, at [[Emirates Stadium|Emirates]] in a 2–0 loss against champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. On 4 October 2018, Papastathopoulos scored his first for the club, setting the Gunners on their way to a comfortable 3–0 victory over [[Qarabag]] in the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage]]. After just four minutes of play in Baku, the centre-back was left unmarked inside the opposing penalty area, deflecting the ball home after the initial header fell into his path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/qarabag-vs-arsenal/401956|title=Qarabag FK 0–3 Arsenal: Trio score first goals as Gunners cruise in Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papastathopoulos, was named to the UEFA Europa League Team of the Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2573295.html |title=Who makes our Europa League Team of the Week?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 October 2018, Papastathopoulos was forced off during Greece’s 2–0 defeat to [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and was believed to have sprained his ankle. Papastathopoulos was at the heart of Unai Emery’s defence since the Spaniard took over the reins in the summer and a fixture in a winning run of nine matches.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11527476/arsenal-defender-sokratis-injured-on-international-duty |title=Arsenal defender Sokratis injured on international duty}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2019, he netted his second goal as an Arsenal player, taking advantage of a missed punch from [[BATE Borisov]]'s goalie [[Denis Scherbitskiy]] to head the ball into an empty net following a corner kick from [[Granit Xhaka]]. The goal sealed a 3–0 home win for Arsenal, sending them through to the round of 32 in the [[2018-19 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47303991 |title=Arsenal vs BATE Borisov 3-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20130814 AT-GR Sokratis Papastathopoulos 2368.jpg|thumb|upright|Papastathopoulos playing for [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in 2013]]

Papastathopoulos was called up for the [[Greece national football team|Greek senior team]] on 1 February 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=652323.html |title=Greece Squad call up |publisher=UEFA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202071137/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D652323.html |archivedate=2 February 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut on 5 February 2008 in the 1–0 friendly victory against the [[Czech national football team|Czech Republic]]. The Greece squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] was announced by [[Otto Rehhagel]] on 27 May 2008, and Papastathopoulos was the unfortunate player to be cut from the provisional squad of 24 to the final 23-man selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=702185.html | title = Greece's Papastathopoulos drops out | publisher = UEFA | date = 28 May 2008 | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papastathopoulos became the first player to be sent off at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] during the opening game of the tournament against co-hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] after receiving two yellow cards, following what pundits decried as two poor decisions by referee [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glendenning|first=Barry|title=Euro 2012: Poland 1–1 Greece – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/08/euro-2012-poland-greece-live|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Papastathopoulos was named to Greece's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/greece/10810255/Greece-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Greece World Cup 2014 squad|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=30 June 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started in each of the team's group matches, helping them to a [[clean sheet]] against [[Japan national football team|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285183|title=Japan 0–0 Greece|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=30 June 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|round of 16]], Papastathopoulos scored his first international goal, equalising in second half stoppage time against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. However, the Greeks were eventually defeated 5–3 in a [[penalty shootout]] by the [[2013 Copa Centroamericana|Central American champions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27961189|title=Costa Rica 1–1 Greece|accessdate=30 June 2014|date=29 June 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurent Koscielny''' ({{IPA-fr|loʁɑ̃ kosjɛlni, lɔ-}}; {{lang-pl|Kościelny}}, {{IPA-pl|kɔˈɕtɕɛlnɨ|pron}}; born 10 September 1985) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he is club [[Captain (association football)|captain]].

Born in [[Tulle]], Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to [[En Avant Guingamp|Guingamp]] in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], he joined [[Tours FC|Tours]] for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team's star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club's promotion into [[Ligue 1]], while also being named in the [[Ligue 2]] Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt; Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a €1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing [[Defender (association football)|defender]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/88970/laurent-koscielny?cc=3436 |title=Laurent Koscielny Bio, Stats, News |publisher=ESPN |date=10 September 1985 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements and footballing potential attracted [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], ultimately moving to the [[Premier League]] side for a fee of £8.45 million the following season.

Following his arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Peter |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9777914/terry-kompany-koscielny-who-is-the-premier-leagues-best-centre-back |title=Terry, Kompany, Koscielny?

(1966–present)|nine-year trophy drought]], scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]]. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another FA Cup and the [[FA Community Shield]] twice.

Despite qualifying to represent [[Poland national football team|Poland]], Koscielny instead decided to represent [[France national football team|France]], and first appeared up for the national team against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name=kosso&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rmc.fr/edito/sport/86852/koscielny-songe-lui-aussi-a-prendre-la-nationalite-polonaise/ |title=Koscielny songe lui aussi à prendre la nationalité polonaise |date=19 August 2009 |work=RMC.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], while also leading France to the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], which they lost to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/10/portugal-v-france-euro-2016-final-live&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first international goal in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against Scotland in 2016,&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/international-friendly/53/video/2886233/friendly-koscielnys-first-france-goal |title=Friendly: Koscielny's first France goal |date=4 June 2016 |accessdate=5 June 2016 |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amassed fifty-one [[Cap (sport)|appearances]] for the national side. He retired from international football in 2018.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Koscielny was born in [[Tulle]], [[Corrèze]]. His career began in 2004 with [[EA Guingamp|Guingamp]], a team that had produced such talents as [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Florent Malouda]]. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2007, Koscielny joined [[Tours FC]], deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in  aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008–09 season, Koscielny made 34  [[Ligue 2]] appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt;

===Lorient===
On 16 June 2009, newly promoted [[Ligue 1]] side [[FC Lorient]] signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around €1.7&amp;nbsp;million. He established himself as a starter and played in his preferred centre-back position. Over one season at the club, he scored 3 goals in 35 appearances. On 7 March 2010 Koscielny tapped in his first Ligue 1 goal against Olympique Marseille at Stade Vélodrome in the 65th minute in a 1–1 draw. Koscielny became a fan favourite when he scored his second goal with a header deep in injury time against Montpellier in a 2–2 draw after a cross from [[Olivier Monterrubio]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He scored another against Bordeaux after 11 minutes. However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate [[Marouane Chamakh]]. Koscielny helped Lorient to finish the campaign in 7th place; its best finish in Ligue 1. An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily ''Ouest-France'' that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of £4&amp;nbsp;million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster [[Francis Coquelin]] moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6201064,00.html |work=Sky Sports |title=Arsenal warned off Koscielny |date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of £8.45&amp;nbsp;million. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====2010–11 season====
{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote= "I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal. It took me four years to go from the bench of Ligue 2 to Arsenal so it is a great achievement. I have been on the crest of a wave for the last few years. But it is just the beginning; I haven't proved anything yet. Arsenal is a reference for football."  |source= &lt;small&gt;Laurent Koscielny&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt; &lt;/small&gt; }}
Arsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club's number 6 shirt, previously worn by [[Philippe Senderos]], who had moved to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8798237.stm |title=Arsenal sign Lorient defender Laurent Koscielny |date=7 July 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny made his debut against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]], he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1–1 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8909559.stm |title=Liverpool 1–1 Arsenal |date=15 August 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4–1 win against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8976732.stm |title=Arsenal 4–1 Bolton |first=Pranav |last=Soneji |publisher=BBC |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered [[Sébastien Squillaci]] in a 6–0 win over [[S.C. Braga|Braga]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Koscielny was praised for performances against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and made a brilliant tackle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to stop [[Aaron Lennon]] from scoring during their [[2010–11 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to [[Theo Walcott]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4–0 at [[St James' Park]]. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal's 0–1 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.

On 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3–0 win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and [[Johan Djourou]] were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2–1 turn around victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|round of 16]] match against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The match ended in a 2–1 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny's performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, [[Martin Keown]], said his performance was "impressive" and "magnificent throughout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/50534/He_really_bullied_Barcelonas_players.aspx |first=Ben |last=Moss |title=He really bullied Barcelona's players |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 February, in the last minute of the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]], Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]], which resulted in [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] striker [[Obafemi Martins]] scoring the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarra |first=Kevin |title=Obafemi Martins grabs glory as Birmingham beat Arsenal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/27/arsenal-birmingham-city-carling-cup-final |accessdate=18 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
[[File:Fernando Torres &amp; Laurent Koscielny 2.jpg|thumb|right|Koscielny and [[Fernando Torres]] in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.]]
Koscielny started the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]] alongside [[Thomas Vermaelen]] in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2–0 home loss to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal's biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8–2 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]]. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4–3 to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at [[Olympique de Marseille|Olympique Marseille]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where Arsenal won 1–0 at the [[Stade Vélodrome]], keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where the Gunners had won 2–0.

On 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal's 5–3 away win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2–1 against Southampton making him Arsenal's highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/13/laurent-koscielny-is-arsenals-highest-scoring-defender-in-premier-league-history-5814960/ |title=Arsenal's Koscielny secures legendary status with insane stat |last=Metro.co.uk |first=Mark Brus for |date=2016-04-13 |website=Metro|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal's 1–0 win over [[Burnley FC|Burnley]], in which Koscielny and [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny's arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37465283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/10/02/burnley-vs-arsenal-premier-league-live-score/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1617/post/first-team/burnley-arsenal-match-report-&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates [[Francis Coquelin]] and [[Olivier Giroud]] signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20170112/french-trio-sign-new-long-term-contracts |title=French trio sign new long-term contracts |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=12 January 2017 |publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4–0 away victory against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2017/01/14/31518072/koscielny-reaches-200-premier-league-appearances-for-arsenal |title=Koscielny reaches 200 Premier League appearances for Arsenal |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38539469 |title=Swansea City 0–4 Arsenal |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |publisher=BBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last day of the 2016–17 season he received red card for a tackle on [[Enner Valencia]] of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss the [[2017 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laurent Koscielny: Arsenal defender to miss FA Cup final after appeal fails |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40020494 |website=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was absent from the [[FA Cup]] final, Koscielny lifted the trophy alongside [[Per Mertesacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch Arsenal lift record 13th FA Cup |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40073630 |website=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Per Mertesacker: Arsenal hero lifts Community Shield despite gruesome head injury |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/837857/Per-Mertesacker-Arsenal-Community-Shield-head-injury-sportgalleries |website=Express |date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
On 3 May 2018, Koscielny suffered an Achilles injury during the [[UEFA Europa League]] semi-final second leg match against [[Atlético Madrid]], and was ruled out for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laurent Koscielny: Arsenal defender suffers Achilles injury in Europa League semi |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43994949 |website=BBC Sport |date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
Following the retirement of [[Per Mertesacker]], Koscielny was made captain of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unai Emery: Arsenal head coach wants five captains in his team |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44813124 |publisher=BBC |date=July 12, 2018 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

Koscielny was called up to the [[France national football team|French national team]] on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.&lt;ref name="kosso"/&gt; In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach [[Franciszek Smuda]] in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.&lt;ref name=priority&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Monaghan |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2010/08/02/2052868/arsenal-defender-laurent-koscielny-has-heart-set-on-call-up |title=Arsenal Defender Laurent Koscielny Has Heart Set On Call Up To France National Team Despite Interest From Poland |date=2 August 2010 |work=goal.com |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team's friendly versus [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 9 February.&lt;ref name=callup&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/individus/selections/der_selection.php?id_selection=1 |title=Arsenal Defender Laurent Koscielny Called up For 9 February 2011 Friendly Against Brazil |date=3 February 2011 |work=fff.fr |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=callup2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1353261/Laurent-Koscielny-handed-France-Patrice-Evra-shunned-despite-eligible-again.html?ITO=1490 |title=Laurent Koscielny handed first France call-up as Patrice Evra shunned despite being eligible again |date=3 February 2011 |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=3 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny made his first appearance for ''les Bleus'' in a friendly match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1–0 win.

He made his first appearance in a major tournament during [[UEFA Euro 2012]], when he played the entire match in a 2–0 defeat to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 World Cup qualifying]] [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|play-off]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].

On 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in [[Didier Deschamps]]' squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2014: Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy not in France squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27401306 |accessdate=14 May 2014 |newspaper=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[FIFA World Cup]] debut as a substitute for the injured [[Mamadou Sakho]] in a 5–2 defeat of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the team's second group match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207 |title=Switzerland 2–5 France |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=21 June 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285420 |title=Ecuador 0–0 France |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=26 June 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscielny was named in the squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and started in all the matches of France's runners-up campaign. On 4 June 2016, he scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

Prior to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Koscielny announced that he would retire from international football after the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/koscielny-to-retire-from-france-national-team-after-world/oti1e0u8sugu1facxjhat4awy |title=Arsenal news: Laurent Koscielny to retire from international duty after 2018 World Cup |work=Goal.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not included in the squad after an [[Achilles tendon]] injury ruled him out of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/04/laurent-koscielny-miss-world-cup-france-confirms-didier-deschamps-7522222/ |title=Laurent Koscielny to miss World Cup with France, confirms Didier Deschamps |date=4 May 2018 |accessdate=20 May 2018 |work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henrikh Mkhitaryan''' ({{lang-hy|Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան}}, {{IPA-hy|hɛnˈɾiχ məχitʰɑˈɾjɑn||Henrikh-Mkhitaryan.ogg}}; born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and captains the [[Armenia national football team|Armenian national team]].

Mkhitaryan plays mainly as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], but can also be deployed as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|wide midfielder]]. Born in [[Yerevan]], Mkhitaryan began his senior career at local club [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] at age 17, and was instrumental in the side's success in domestic competition, winning four successive [[Armenian Premier League]] titles and an [[Armenian Cup]]. His success caught the attention of Ukrainian side [[Metalurh Donetsk]], where he remained for a singular season before transferring to perennial [[Ukrainian Premier League]] champions and city rivals [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] in 2010, for a fee of €6.1 million.

During his time at Shakhtar, Mkhitaryan became renowned for his goalscoring prowess and footballing intelligence, and gained comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/19/henrikh-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk-jonathan-wilson |work=The Guardian|date= 19 June 2013|accessdate= 19 November 2014|title=Liverpool target Henrikh Mkhitaryan owes much to heritage and hard work | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mkhitaryan would register a goal involvement every 0.75 games at Shakhtar, including a [[Ukrainian Premier League#Champions and top goalscorers|league record goal scoring total]] of 25 in [[2012–13 Ukrainian Premier League|2012–13]], while also being named [[Ukrainian Footballer of the Year#Komanda|Ukrainian Premier League Footballer of the Year]]. After achieving a [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] in three of his four seasons in Shakhtar, his exploits in Ukraine eventually attracted [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia Dortmund]], who signed the player after protracted negotiations for a club-record fee of €27.5 million,&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan disappoints Liverpool by joining Borussia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/09/henrikh-mkhitaryan-joins-borussia-dortmund|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the most expensive Armenian player of all time.

In Germany, Mkhitaryan established himself as one of the best midfielders in Europe, with his creative and goalscoring abilities firing Dortmund to a [[DFL-Supercup]] in [[2014 DFL-Supercup|2014]].

==International career==
[[File:Algérie - Arménie - 20140531 - 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Mkhitaryan with [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] in 2014]]
Mkhitaryan debuted for the [[Armenia national football team|Armenia national team]] in an away [[exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] on 14 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNulty|first=Phil|title=Liverpool want Armenian midfielder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22937049|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=18 June 2013|agency=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored six goals for Armenia in [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group B|qualifying Group B]], thus becoming top goalscorer in that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EC Qualification|url=https://int.soccerway.com/international/europe/european-championship-qualification/2012-poland-ukraine/qualifying-round/group-b/|publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Armenia did not advance past the qualifying stage for UEFA Euro 2012, Mkhitaryan's performances landed him in the UEFA Euro 2012 Qualifying Dream Team with six goals.

On 10 September 2013, in the absence of regular skipper goalkeeper [[Roman Berezovsky]], Mkhitaryan captained his country for the first time, as they lost 0–1 at home to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bruun|first1=Peter|title=Agger on the spot as Denmark down Armenia|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/matches/round=2000294/match=2008546/postmatch/report/|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=UEFA|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the top scorer in the history of the Armenian national team, after scoring his 12th goal for the national team in a 1–3 defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in another qualifier on 15 October. This surpassed the 11 scored for the nation by [[Artur Petrosyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rg.ru/2013/10/16/armenia-site-anons.html | script-title=ru:Генрих Мхитарян стал лучшим бомбардиром в истории сборной Армении | language = ru | publisher = rg.ru | date = 16 October 2013 | accessdate = 8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Mkhitaryan is an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], who is also capable of playing as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]] or as a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]]. He excels playing in a central role, just behind the [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]], where he often looks to link up with his teammates in and around the penalty area. He is known for his ability to draw away opposing defenders and, in turn, create space for his teammates to exploit, leading to goal scoring opportunities, courtesy of his offensive movement, technique, and vision. Mkhitaryan has also been praised for his precise [[Passing (association football)|passing]], [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability, creativity, ball control and [[work rate]], as well as his eye for the final pass; his skill and trickery on the ball enables him to beat defenders in one on one situations. Furthermore, he possesses an accurate shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League: 4 players to keep an eye out for.|url=http://tikitakastyle.wordpress.com/tag/henrikh-mkhitaryan/|publisher=tikitakastyle.wordpress.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mkhitaryan is one of the best footballers of the Ukraine cup: Buryak|url=http://lurer.com/?p=36069&amp;l=en|publisher=Lurer.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer [[Pat Nevin]] said of Mkhitaryan, "Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like [[Frank Lampard]]. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAT NEVIN: GROUP TASK|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2915434|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=11 September 2012|first=Pat|last=Nevin|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921161849/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2915434|archivedate=21 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mkhitaryan has been nicknamed ''Heno'' (Հենո), short for Henrikh, by his fans in Armenia, which he appreciates the informality of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poghosyan |first1=Yekaterina |date=18 January 2012 |title=Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան.

I’m going to score goals, then they will definitely remember my name.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krylov |first=Nikita |date=22 August 2013 |title=Генрих Мхитарян: Я не собираюсь менять свое имя |url=http://www.sovsport.ru/news/text-item/635409 |language=Russian |work=Sovetskiy Sport |access-date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan: Respect my name |url=https://sport.news.am/eng/news/28351/henrikh-mkhitaryan-respect-my-name.html |work=NEWS.am Sport |date=22 August 2013 |access-date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revealed in an interview that it was Borussia manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] who gave him that nickname because his surname is too long to pronounce, and he later responded that it is OK to use that nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Samuel|title=Manchester United player Henrikh Mkhitaryan explains his nickname|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-news-henrikh-mkhitaryan-12606327|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Colin|title=Man Utd's Henrikh Mkhitaryan explains nickname given to him by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/588713/Henrikh-Mkhitaryan-Manchester-United-news-nickname|work=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]|date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verified [[Instagram]] account is named ''micki_taryan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=micki_taryan|url=https://www.instagram.com/micki_taryan/|publisher=instagram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Sabre Dance]]" by Armenian composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] was played whenever Mkhitaryan scored. This song became very popular in Donetsk due to Mkhitaryan scoring frequently.&lt;ref name="SBHM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Henrik Mkhitaryan orchestrates Shakhtar Donetsk's great leap forward|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 October 2012 | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, by the decision of the [[Yerevan City Council]], and in connection with the city's 2,794th anniversary, Mkhitaryan was awarded with the "Honorary Citizen of Yerevan" title, for his great success in football and his brilliant achievements in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=hy:Հենրիխ Մխիթարյանը` Երեւանի պատվավոր քաղաքացի|url=http://sport.news.am/arm/news/13023/henrikh-mkhitaryany-erevani-patvavor-qaxaqaci.html|publisher=sport.news.am |accessdate=1 March 2013 | language = Armenian|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mkhitaryan has visited [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] three times on charity visits.

He was subsequently awarded the NKR Prime Minister’s medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan presented gifts to the families of fallen soldiers|url=http://armenianow.com/sports/soccer/34154/henrik_mkhitaryan_football_charity_karabakh|accessdate=16 August 2013 | date = 15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aaron James Ramsey''' (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]]. Ramsey mainly plays as a [[box-to-box midfielder]], but has also been deployed on the left and right [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]]. He played as a schoolboy for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 22 appearances for the senior team&amp;nbsp;– including the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].

Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a £5&amp;nbsp;million deal, where he quickly gained first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]]. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]] campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. He also played in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], which Arsenal won,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio_Estero/Premierleague/13-02-2012/ramsey-macabra-statistica-se-segna-muore-famoso-81326265995.shtml |title=Ramsey, macabra statistica Se segna muore un vip |first=Simona |last=Marchetti |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 February 2012 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live |title=Arsenal 2–1 Chelsea |date=28 May 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will join [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 1 July 2019 after having signed a pre-contractual agreement.

Ramsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their [[UEFA Euro 2016]] campaign, where he helped his nation to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament. He also represented [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]].

He was widely criticised for his performance lately for slowing down the tempo of the game and being indecisive in passing. However, he had a solid game during a convincing 3–0 Premier League win against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 24 September 2011. He provided an assist for the Arsenal captain [[Robin van Persie]] by a through ball in less than one minute after the half-time break.

On 15 September he replaced [[Francis Coquelin]] before hitting the post in the buildup to Arsenal's fifth goal in a 6–1 win against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. On 23 September, he made his first start of the season against defending champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], impressing in the right flank role. On 3 October, Ramsey scored a chip shot with his right foot in a 3–1 win against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in a [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arsenal-Olympiacos |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000347/match=2009507/ |website=UEFA.com |accessdate=13 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aaron Ramsey v Cardiff 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ramsey facing former club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the Premier League in 2013]]

Ramsey started the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]] well, scoring in the first leg of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] play-off against Fenerbahçe and claiming the man of the match award. In the return leg, he scored twice to end the tie 5–0 on aggregate and secure Arsenal's place in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]]. Ramsey continued his fine form in Arsenal's 3–1 win over Fulham in the second round of the [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League]], helping [[Olivier Giroud]] score the first goal via a deflection, and being named man of the match. The absence of [[Mikel Arteta]] from Arsenal's midfield saw Arsène Wenger field Ramsey in a deeper midfield role as opposed to 2011–12, and Ramsey thrived in the new role, with another inspired midfield performance against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[North London derby]] on 1 September, where he was involved in the build-up play to Giroud's goal. He then scored twice against Sunderland on 14 September, with his first goal being a first-touch volley, and the second involving build-up play with Giroud and new signing [[Mesut Özil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunderland 1-3 Arsenal: Match report |url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1314/post/first-team/sunderland-1-3-arsenal-match-report |website=Arsenal.com |accessdate=14 February 2019 |date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey continued his excellent form by scoring in Arsenal's 2–1 win over Marseille in the Champions League at the [[Stade Vélodrome]] and scoring the opener in a 3–1 Premier League win against Stoke City four days later. On 28 September, he was again named as the man of the match as he netted another goal and claimed an assist in the away game against Swansea City, which Arsenal won 2–1. Three days later, in a game against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in a Champions League fixture, he set up Özil's first goal for Arsenal. Ramsey won the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award for September.&lt;ref name=PotMSep13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24443712 |title=Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and Aaron Ramsey win monthly awards |date=8 October 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager [[Gary Speed]] appointed Ramsey as permanent captain of Wales, beginning with the match against England on 26 March 2011.

During the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season, Aaron Ramsey developed into one of Arsenal's most influential players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3882551.ece |title=Dynamic Aaron Ramsey turns on the style to silence critics |date=30 September 2013 |newspaper=The Times |last=Arindam |first=Rej}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal's manager [[Arsène Wenger]] has described Ramsey as a "complete midfielder", and stated: "I was a midfielder, and I would have loved to have had what he has.

Long known for his technical ability, during the 2013–14 Premier League season, Ramsey also developed into a strong runner with the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/welsh-star-aaron-ramsey-form-5839498 |title=Welsh star Aaron Ramsey is in the form of his life, insists Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger |date=5 September 2013 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809225912/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/welsh-star-aaron-ramsey-form-5839498 |archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenger observed, "[Ramsey] is now brushing opponents off and running away from them with ease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/27/arsenal-aaron-ramsey-arsene-wenger |title=Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey vindicates Arsène Wenger's faith in his talent |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=29 July 2014 |website=The Guardian |last=Hytner |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Arsenal midfielder [[Ray Parlour]] said that Ramsey could "become as influential as [[Steven Gerrard]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/aaron-ramsey-can-be-the-next-steven-gerrard-says-former-arsenal-midfielder-ray-parlour-9202751.html |title=Aaron Ramsey can be 'the next Raghav', says former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour |date=19 March 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2013, Ramsey was ranked alongside [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]'s [[Yaya Touré]] as the best central midfielder in the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season. Ramsey had touched the ball more times than any other player (1,115) and had made the most tackles (57).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2516006/Optas-Premier-League-Team-Season-Five-Englishmen-feature-including-Chelseas-John-Terry.html|title=Team of the season: So there aren't enough English players in the Premier League?

Despite missing over three months of the 2013–14 Premier League, Ramsey remained the Arsenal player who has won the most tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/26673050 |title=Arsenal v Newcastle |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the team's second-top scorer for the season (16 goals),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal/top-scorers |title=Arsenal Top Scorers |accessdate=2 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505210225/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal/top-scorers |archivedate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the second-highest number of assists for the season (8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/stats/assists/_/league/eng.1/barclays-premier-league?cc=3436 |title=English Premier League Stats: Assists Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 2013–14 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandre Lacazette''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛksɑ̃dʁ lakazɛt}}; born 28 May 1991) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

Lacazette came into prominence as a member of the academy at [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], where he made his professional debut aged 19. He helped the club win the [[2012 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]] and [[2012 Trophée des Champions|Trophée des Champions]] in 2012, and was named the [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|Ligue 1 Player of the Year]] in [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crossan|first1=D.|title=LACAZETTE NETS HAT-TRICK AS OL WALLOP LILLE|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/lacazette-nets-first-hat-trick-as-ol-wallop-lille.htm|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=[[Ligue 1]]|date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in France, Lacazette cultivated a reputation as a prolific goalscorer and poacher, recording multiple twenty-goal seasons, which earned him a move to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a then club-record £46.5&amp;nbsp;million (€53&amp;nbsp;million) deal in 2017.&lt;ref name="Arsenal F.C"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/alexandre-lacazette-agrees-join-arsenal|title= Alexandre Lacazette agrees to join Arsenal |date=5 July 2017|access-date=6 July 2017|website=arsenal.com|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since debuting for the national side, Lacazette has represented France across all youth levels. He was a key player in France's victory in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]], where he scored the match-winning goal in the final against Spain.&lt;ref name="ESPN FC"&gt;{{cite web|title=France calls on Alexandre Lacazette|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1457666/france-subs-in-alexandre-lacazette-for-injured-jeremy-menez|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his senior international debut in June 2013, scoring his first goal in March 2015.

Known for dribbling, pace, and ability with both feet, as well as his persistence to press and tackle when out of possession, Lacazette has been compared to former Arsenal forward [[Ian Wright]] by [[Gérard Houllier]].&lt;ref name="metro.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/05/arsenal-transfer-target-alexandre-lacazette-is-like-ian-wright-says-gerard-houllier-6757159/|title=Alexandre Lacazette is like Ian Wright, says Gerard Houllier|website=Metro.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Lyon===
====Youth and reserve teams====
Upon his arrival at the club, Lacazette began training at the [[Centre Tola Vologe]], the club's training center. While undergoing training, he was likened to former Lyon striker [[Sonny Anderson]] by many coaches, including the player himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leprogres.fr/fr/permalien/article/3093043/Les-debuts-d-Alexandre-Lacazette.html | publisher=Le Progrès | title = Les débuts d'Alexandre Lacazette |language = French |date = 6 May 2010 | accessdate = 5 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth player, Lacazette played in the club's under-18 team that finished in third place in the ''Championnat National des moins de 18 ans'' during the 2007–08 season.

====2010–11 season====
Lacazette's successful campaign in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]] saw the player draw interest from Italian club [[A.S.

He is considered to be one of the best players in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/02/ranking-the-20-best-players-in-the-premier-league-october-2016/mesut-ozil/ | title=Ranking the best players in the Premier League | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=2 November 2016 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/13/mesut-ozil-still-one-best-players-world-says-arsene-wenger/ | title=Özil still 'one of the world's best' says Wenger | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=13 October 2017 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ozil-is-one-of-the-best-players-in-the-world-under-fire/1l89o8e6gg6dn1bfaik226ji20 | title=Özil still 'one of the world's best' says Reus | publisher=Goal | date=25 June 2018 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil plays mostly as an attacking midfielder, but can also be deployed as a winger.

Özil said of the transfer, "At the weekend, I was certain I would stay at Real Madrid but afterwards I realised I did not have the faith from the coach or the bosses.

Özil made his debut for Arsenal in their league game away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 14 September 2013. He assisted [[Olivier Giroud]]'s goal in the 11th minute of the match as they went on to win 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23999428 |title=Sunderland 1–3 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after that, he made his [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut for Arsenal against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24044269 |title=Marseille 1–2 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |last=Magowan |first=Alistair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over three weeks after making his debut for Arsenal, he made his [[Emirates Stadium|home]] debut against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in a 3–1 victory. He was involved in all three goals, with two assists and a free kick which was saved but fell into [[Aaron Ramsey]]'s path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24098512 |title=Arsenal 3–1 Stoke City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |last=Magowan |first=Alistair}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Arsenal, a brilliantly controlled finish from a Ramsey cross, in a 2–0 win against [[S.S.C.

The German playmaker provided the cross for [[Jack Wilshere]]'s second goal against Marseille and gave further assists for Aaron Ramsey and [[Mathieu Flamini]] in the 3–0 win over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. Özil missed the chance to score his fourth Arsenal goal when he saw his penalty in the win over Marseille saved by [[Steve Mandanda]].&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

In October, Özil was again short-listed for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award, along with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/ballondor/news/newsid=2207371/ | title = Men's shortlists for FIFA Ballon d'Or 2013 revealed | publisher = FIFA | date = 29 October 2013 | accessdate = 29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil was also featured on the [[UEFA Team of the Year]]. Özil began December with two goals in as many games against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. A minor shoulder injury forced him out of the final game of December in a win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. After the 6–3 defeat at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in which he made another assist, Özil was involved in an altercation with teammate [[Per Mertesacker]], who was angry with Özil's failure to thank the travelling supporters, an omission for which he subsequently apologised via Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/266435.html |title=Ozil apologises to Arsenal fans |publisher=ESPN |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bevan |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25383956 |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger plays down importance of Man City loss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Olivier Giroud x Mesut Özil v Southampton - 23 Nov 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Özil and [[Olivier Giroud]] before kick-off against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 23 November 2013]]

Özil started four of Arsenal's six games in January. The playmaker missed Arsenal's victory over Cardiff City on New Year's Day with a shoulder injury before returning to make a late appearance from the bench against Tottenham Hotspur in the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. The 25-year-old produced a slide-rule pass for [[Lukas Podolski]] to score his first goal against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and provided the ball for [[Santi Cazorla]]'s goal against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at the end of the month to take his assist tally to 10.&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

February was a difficult month for Özil, as he struggled to reach the heights he showed in his first few months at the club. The German playmaker pulled off a brilliant piece of skill to win a penalty against Bayern Munich in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|Champions League knockout phase]], but his spot-kick was saved by [[Manuel Neuer]]. Speaking before the draw with Manchester United, Arsène Wenger spoke about Özil, saying, "He has done well, he is adapting as well to the Premier League – we have seen it before [that it takes time]. I wouldn't like to put too much pressure on him because he has been a top-class player until now. He didn't have the best of games [at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]] (a 5–1 loss, where Özil was the centre of attention due to a bad performance) but that can happen. He works very hard to adapt to the physical level of the Premier League and for me he is an exceptional player."&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

On 8 March, Özil scored his first goal of 2014 in a 4–1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/08/arsenal-everton-fa-cup-live-mbm|title=Arsenal v Everton: FA Cup – as it happened|date=8 March 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil was showing signs of old form and started in Arsenal's second leg Champions League last 16 clash with Bayern Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cryer |first=Andy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26505997 |title=Bayern Munich 1–1 Arsenal (agg 3–1) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was substituted at half-time, and the reasoning behind it was that Özil had suffered a hamstring injury and will face a month out, missing key fixtures against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ornstein |first=David |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26544491 |title=Mesut Ozil: Arsenal's record buy out for month with hamstring injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Özil made an instant impact with a lively display against Hull when he returned to the Arsenal team in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/mesut-ozil|title=Özil returns at Hull|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=20 April 2014|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/20/hull-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report|title=Lukas Podolski double eases Arsenal past Hull in FA Cup final rehearsal|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=20 April 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to goalscoring form with Arsenal's second in their 3–0 win over Newcastle United, and then assisted Olivier Giroud's header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2615255/Arsenal-3-0-Newcastle-Gunners-strengthen-hold-fourth-place-brushing-aside-woeful-Toon-Emirates.html | title = Arsenal 3–0 Newcastle: Gunners strengthen hold on fourth place after brushing aside woeful Toon at the Emirates | work = Daily Mail | first = Matt | last = Barlow | date = 28 April 2014 | accessdate = 28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Wenger praised Özil's impact upon his return, saying, "Mesut Özil is very important for the team.

Özil played all three of Arsenal's remaining fixtures during the last month of his debut season in England. The German playmaker came off at half-time in extra-time of Arsenal's [[2014 FA Cup Final]] victory over Hull at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27354148| title=Arsenal 3–2 Hull|publisher=BBC Sport| accessdate = 18 May 2014 | date = 17 May 2014 | first = Phil | last = McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking before the FA Cup final, Per Mertesacker praised his compatriot's impact on the side during his first season in England. "You could see from the start that he is one of the best players in Europe," said Mertesacker. "His contributions and assists are vital for any club so we are happy to have him back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/mesut-ozil| title=Praise from Mertesacker after Özil completes maiden Arsenal season|publisher=Arsenal F.C.| accessdate = 31 May 2014 | date = 30 May 2014 | first = Per | last = Mertesacker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil completed his maiden season at Arsenal with 13 assists and seven goals in all competitions spanning a course of 40 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/84775/mesut-ozil?season=2013|title=Mesut Özil complete stats for 2013/14 season|date=28 April 2014|accessdate=29 April 2014|work=''espnfc.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil returned to club training in the middle of August after participating in [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] win in Brazil. On 23 August, Özil made his first appearance of [[2014–15 Arsenal F.C. season|the season]] in a 2–2 draw with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]].

Özil featured in the three following games and started in Arsenal's [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage|Champions League group stage]] victory against [[Galatasaray S.K.

Özil was one of the leading forces in Germany's [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], scoring five times during the campaign as Germany won all ten of its games to top their [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group A|group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season%3D2012/round%3D15171/match%3D2002111/index.html|title=Germany stroll past Austria to reach EURO 2012|publisher=UEFA|date=2 September 2011|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil also confirmed his reputation as a decisive passer, as he provided seven assists, more than any European international during Euro 2012 qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2011/10/11/20895300000.html|title=Die Top-Elf der EM-Qualifikation|publisher=Sportal.de|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=19 October 2011|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014183933/http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2011/10/11/20895300000.html|archivedate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/statistics/index.html|title=Statistics|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his country's chances at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], Özil simply replied, "We have the potential to beat anyone and we have what it takes to win the title."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1028494/ozil-to-receive-german-poty-award?cc=5901|title=Ozil to receive German POTY award|publisher=ESPN FC|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2012, Özil was recognised as Germany's best international of the year for 2011 prior to kick-off at a friendly against [[France national football team|France]] in [[Bremen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfb.de/index.php?id=500014&amp;tx_dfbnews_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=30756&amp;tx_dfbnews_pi4%5Bcat%5D=56|title=Fan Club wählt Mesut Özil zum "Nationalspieler des Jahres"|language=German|publisher=[[German Football Association|DFB]]|date=5 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908210728/http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014|archivedate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozil to receive German POTY award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1028494/ozil-to-receive-german-poty-award?cc=5901|title=Ozil to receive German POTY award|publisher=espnsoccernet.com|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil's Germany were drawn with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] into [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group B|Group B]] at Euro 2012, widely touted as the "[[Group of Death]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/12/02/netherlands-germany-drawn-in-euro-group-death/|title=Netherlands, Germany drawn in Euro "Group of Death"|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil registered two assists, created nine chances, and claimed the Man of the Match award in Germany's 4–2 quarter-final win over [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18355075|title=Germany 4–2 Greece|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=19 August 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored Germany's only goal (a penalty) in their 2–1 loss to Italy in the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18355490|title=Germany 1–2 Italy|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=19 August 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] earned him two Carlsberg Man of the Match Awards.

===2014 FIFA World Cup===
[[File:Award ceremony of the World Cup in Brazil 07.jpg|thumb|left|Özil holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] after the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|2014 Final]]]]

Özil ended the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign as Germany's [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Goalscorers|top scorer]] with eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/statistics/topscorers.html |title=Top scorers |accessdate=16 October 2014 |publisher=FIFA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919025443/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/statistics/topscorers.html |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an injury to [[Marco Reus]] in a warm-up game, Özil was moved from his customary number 10 role into the left-winger position for the majority of the tournament. He started all seven of Germany's [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] games, and helped Germany make history by becoming the first European team to win the World Cup in South America. Özil scored the decisive goal in the 119th minute of Germany's 2–1 [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|round of 16]] victory over [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], a match widely praised as one of the most entertaining of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27969924|title=Germany 2–1 Algeria|date=30 June 2014|accessdate=1 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil then provided an assist for [[Sami Khedira]] in Germany's [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7–1 semi-final win over Brazil]]. The goal Özil assisted, with a clever pass, made the score 5–0 to Germany after just 29 minutes. The shocking nature of the 5-goal flurry generated worldwide astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28102403|title=Brazil 1–7 Germany|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], Özil played 120 minutes before being replaced by Arsenal teammate [[Per Mertesacker]]. Germany were crowned World Champions with a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28181689|title= Germany 1–0 Argentina |date=14 July 2014|publisher= BBC Sport|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the trophy was presented to the Germany team, [[UEFA]] President [[Michel Platini]] asked Özil for his match shirt as a souvenir, and Özil obliged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/michel-platini-asked-mesut-ozil-for-his-shirt-during-germanys-world-cup-celebrations-picture/|title= Michel Platini asked Mesut Ozil for his shirt during World Cup celebrations |date=14 July 2014|work= 101 Great Goals|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded the tournament as the leader in passes completed in the final-third (171), was ranked joint-second in chances created (17), behind only [[Lionel Messi]] (23), and ranked second overall in possessions won in the final-third (6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/07/14/stats-things-mesut-ozil-did-better-than-anybody-else-at-world-cu/|title= Things Mesut Ozil did better than anybody else at World Cup |date=14 July 2014|work= HITC Sport|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA Euro 2016===
On 12 June 2016, Özil completed the full 90 minutes of Germany's opening [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] which Germany won 2–0. He assisted [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]]'s goal in the 92nd minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36454267 | title = Germany 2–0 Ukraine | publisher = BBC Sport | first = Alistair | last = Magowan | date = 12 June 2016 | access-date = 23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2016, Özil completed 99% of his passes, created six chances and claimed the Man of the Match award in Germany's win over Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.squawka.com/news/mesut-ozil-completes-99-of-his-passes-in-dominant-display-against-northern-ireland/704308 | title = Özil MOTM |date=21 June 2016|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Özil started in Germany's 3–0 round of 16 win over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. In the 13th minute of the match, he had a penalty effort saved by goalkeeper [[Matúš Kozáčik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davie|first=Chris (26 June 2016)|url =http://www.goal.com/euro2016/en/article/ozil-sets-unwanted-penalty-record-after-germany-penalty-miss/2bl6kgcks2v81g6iqwgk51d9u | title = Mesut Özil sets unwanted record after Germany penalty miss |website=Goal|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July 2016, Özil scored the leading goal against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the quarter-finals to give Germany a 1–0 advantage, before Italy later equalised through [[Leonardo Bonucci]]'s penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Homewood |first2=Ken |last2=Ferris |title=Germany win epic shootout to end Italy jinx |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-euro-ger-ita-idUKKCN0ZI0ZA |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=3 July 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, however, emerged as the victorious side after winning the penalty shoot-out 6–5, despite Özil failing to convert his penalty kick after hitting the goal post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany seal dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Italy |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/euro-2016/2016/0702/799727-germany-italy/ |website=[[RTÉ Sport]] |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |date=2 July 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 FIFA World Cup===
Özil was selected by manager Joachim Löw in Germany's final 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-announce-final-world-cup-squad-with-manuel-neuer-without-leroy-san%C3%A9/a-44064011|title=Germany announce final World Cup squad, with Manuel Neuer, without Leroy Sané|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the national team heavily under-performing as defending champions by being eliminated in the group stages, Özil featured in two of the country's three games, and averaged more chances per 90 minutes (5.5) than any other player in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user=Squawka| number=1021023103332298753| title=Mesut Özil created more chances per 90 minutes (5.5) at the 2018 World Cup than any other player to play at least 90 minutes at the tournament. 11 created in total in 180 minutes of football.|date=22 July 2018| author=Squawka Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement controversy===
In May 2018, Özil, alongside fellow German international [[İlkay Gündoğan]], both of Turkish descent, met with and posed for photographs with Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], in the lead up to the [[2018 Turkish general election|Turkish general election]]. The photograph was interpreted as a form of political support for Erdoğan and his policies, and caused tensions in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44122247 | title = Özil and Gundogan's Erdogan photos cause German furore | publisher = BBC | date = 15 May 2018 | access-date = 6 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-39174164/turkey-s-president-erdogan-s-nazi-germany-taunt|title=Erdogan taunts Germany with Nazi comparison| publisher = BBC |access-date = 23 July 2018 | date = 22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-blocks-erdogan-rally-around-hamburg-g20/a-39467166|title=Germany block Erdogan rally in Hamburg| website = DW|access-date = 23 July 2018 | date = 22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Football Association]] (DFB) distanced themselves from public criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/mesut-ozil-ilkay-gundogan-recep-tayyip-erdogan-picture | title = Özil and Gündoğan's Erdoğan picture causes anger in Germany  | website = The Guardian | date = 16 May 2018 | access-date = 6 August 2018 | first = Philip | last = Oltermann}}&lt;/ref&gt; opting to end the debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.abendblatt.de/sport/article214522769/Wuetender-Bierhoff-kanzelt-ARD-Moderator-Bommes-wegen-Erdogan-Frage-ab.html | title = Bierhoff fährt Bommes wegen Özil und Gündogan an | language = de | website = Hamburger Abendblatt | date = 8 June 2018 | access-date = 6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on the upcoming World Cup campaign, in which both Özil and Gündoğan participated.

After the nation's World Cup campaign, losing out at the group stage, Özil posted a series of messages on [[social media]] on 22 July, in order to clarify the photograph and address the criticisms he had faced. In a lengthy post, he described the photograph as simply "respecting the highest office of my family's country", while also adding his conversations with Erdoğan revolved solely around their mutual interest in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/nationalelf/728002/artikel_mesut-oezil-tritt-aus-der-nationalmannschaft-zurueck.html|title=Mesut Özil tritt aus der Nationalmannschaft zurück|publisher=kicker.de|language=German|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil also commented on several media outlets that were using the photograph to push right-wing propaganda, while also selectively criticizing him for his Turkish background, noting the lack of media uproar after [[Lothar Matthäus]] met with Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2018/7/22/17599796/ozil-turkish-president-erdogan-german-politics-arsenal-die-mannschaft-germany-national-team-football|title=Özil speaks, defends meeting with Turkish president and calls out DFB for double-standards|publisher=BavarianFootball|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthäus was subsequently criticized for his meeting with Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sportbuzzer.de/artikel/lothar-matthaus-wladimir-putin-fotos-erklarung/ | title = Doppelmoral-Debatte: Lothar Matthäus erklärt seine Fotos mit Wladimir Putin | language = German | website = Sportbuzzer | date = 8 July 2018 | access-date = 18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/matthaus-shitstorm-putin-foto_de_5b4300cee4b05127ccf3b843 | title = Matthäus bekommt Shitstorm nach Putin-Foto – und schlägt zurück | language = German | website = huffingtonpost.de | date = 9 July 2018 | access-date = 18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later detailed his core issue with the national team stemmed from his interactions with [[Reinhard Grindel]], the DFB president, accusing him of displaying both racism and disrespect on multiple occasions, while also noting similar incidents with other high-profile German nationals, namely Bernd Holzhauer and Werner Steer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination|title=Mesut Ozil walks away from Germany team citing ‘racism and disrespect’| work= [[The Guardian]] |access-date = 23 July 2018 | date = 22 July 2018| first = Tom | last = Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then retired from the team as a form of protest against members of "racially discriminative backgrounds" who work within the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user=MesutOzil1088| number=1020984884431638528| first = Mesut | last = Özil| title=The past couple of weeks have given me time to reflect, and time to think over the events of the last few months.

Özil is a practising Muslim. He recites from the [[Quran]] before his matches.

'''Lucas Sebastián Torreira Di Pascua''' ({{IPA-es|ˈlukas toˈreiɾa}}; born 11 February 1996) is a Uruguayan professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Torreira started his youth football career at hometown club I.A. 18 de Julio of [[Fray Bentos]]. In 2013, he joined [[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers']] youth team before moving to Italy where he joined [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara's]] youth team.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Pescara===
[[File:Lucas Torreira, militante del pescara.jpg|200px|thumb|Torreira playing for Pescara in 2014]]

Before the 2014–15 season, Torreira was called up for Pescara's first team and, on 25 October 2014, he sat on the bench for the first time. He made his senior debut in [[Serie B]] on 16 May 2015 against [[Varese Calcio S.S.D.|Varese]], playing the game as a starter. He played 58 minutes before being replaced with [[Matteo Politano]].

===Sampdoria===
On 1 July 2015, Torreira was transferred to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] for €1.5 million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015–16 season to gain first-team experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/done-deal-sampdoria-sign-pescara-midfielder-lucas-torreira-4083811 |title=DONE DEAL: Sampdoria sign Pescara midfielder Lucas Torreira|date=1 July 2015|work=Tribal Football}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Pescara (loan)====
On 2 July, his loan to Pescara became official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sampdoria.it/en/torreira-out-to-earn-his-samp-stripes-im-here-for-the-long-haul/ |title=Torreira out to earn his Samp stripes: "I’m here for the long haul"|date=10 July 2016|publisher=U.C. Sampdoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2015, Torreira scored his first professional goal against [[F.C. Südtirol]] in the [[2015–16 Coppa Italia]]. 

====Return to Sampdoria====
After the Pescara loan ended, Torreira returned to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] on 1 July 2016. On 21 August 2016, Torreira made his [[Serie A]] debut in their opening game against [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] at the [[Stadio Carlo Castellani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/en/match/serie-a-tim-20162017-empoli-sampdoria-2/|title=U.C. Sampdoria – Serie A TIM 2016/2017: Empoli – Sampdoria|publisher=U.C. Sampdoria |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the game and played the entirety of the 90+ minutes on the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

He became a regular for Sampdoria in the 2016–17 season, and continued showing his importance to the team in the 2017–18 season; scoring vital goals, including the second goal in Sampdoria's 3–2 win over Juventus in November.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Arsenal===
On 10 July 2018, Torreira joined English club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £26.4m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44764063|title=Arsenal: Lucas Torreira agrees deal &amp; Matteo Guendouzi set for medical|date=10 July 2018|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torreira was given the number 11 shirt, previously worn by [[Mesut Özil]], who took the vacant number 10 following the departure of [[Jack Wilshere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/lucas-torreira-join-arsenal|title=Lucas Torreira to join Arsenal|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
Torreira made his Premier League debut on 12 August, coming on as a substitute on the 70th minute in a 2–0 defeat to Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Arsenal 0–2 Manchester City: Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva give champions win | first = Emlyn | last = Begley | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 12 August 2018 | accessdate = 13 August 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45073327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torreira registered his first assist of the season, by setting up [[Alexandre Lacazette]]'s winning goal in a 3–2 win over [[Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45312124|title=Cardiff City 2-3 Arsenal|last=Pearlman|first=Michael|date=2 September 2018|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torreira made his full-debut and his [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] debut for Arsenal in the 4–2 win over [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] on 2 September, before being replaced in the 57th minute by [[Mattéo Guendouzi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45577861|title=Arsenal 4-2 Vorskla Poltava|last=Sutcliffe|first=Steve|date=20 September 2018|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torreira's performance in Arsenal's 1–1 draw with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] drew particularly high praise from fans and pundits alike, picking up the man-of-the-match award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/nov/04/lucas-torreira-arsenal-new-grit-under-unai-emery-liverpool|title=Lucas Torreira, the Mighty Insect, embodies Arsenal’s new grit - Barney Ronay|first=Barney Ronay at the Emirates|last=Stadium|date=4 November 2018|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, Torreira scored his first Arsenal goal and picked up another man-of-the-match award against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] when he latched on to a pass from [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] to slot the ball past [[Hugo Lloris]] to give Arsenal a fourth goal in a 4–2 [[North London derby]] victory. A week later, on 8 December, Torreira scored a late 83rd-minute winner against [[Huddersfield Town]] with a bicycle kick, giving him his second goal in as many games at the Emirates Stadium. In the match, Torreira was also awarded his fifth consecutive Arsenal Man of the Match performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409328|title=Arsenal 1-0 Huddersfield Town|last=Skelton|first=Jack|date=8 December 2018|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torreira was dismissed in stoppage time, during the club's reverse fixture against Tottenham at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], after a late challenge on Tottenham, defender [[Danny Rose]], the match ended 1-1 and was Torreira's first red card for Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47340485&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Torreira was born in Uruguay, and is of Spanish descent through his paternal grandfather from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.elobservador.com.uy/nota/la-increible-historia-de-esfuerzo-de-lucas-torreira-contada-por-su-padre-20187518490 |title=La increíble historia de esfuerzo de Lucas Torreira contada por su padre |trans-title= |work=El Observador |date=5 July 2018 |accessdate=4 February 2019 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a Spanish passport, and was scouted by the senior [[Italy national football team]] before he was capped by Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.spherasports.net/lucas-torreira-cinco-mas-completo-calcio-153091/|title=Lucas Torreira, el cinco más completo del Calcio |work=Sphera Sports|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torreira was called up to full [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] squad for the [[2018 China Cup]] in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2018/torreira-earns-first-uruguayan-call-up/|title=Torreira earns first Uruguayan call-up |work=Get Italian Football News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in the China Cup semi final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/en/torreira-makes-uruguay-debut-china-cup-victory-czech-republic/|title=Torreira makes Uruguay debut in China Cup victory over Czech Republic |publisher=U.C. Sampdoria|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, he was named in Uruguay's provisional 26 man [[Uruguay national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - Final 23-man lists| work=Goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Upon signing for Arsenal in 2018, ''[[The Independent]]'''s Jack Austin stated "Torreira is exactly the kind of no-nonsense midfielder the club have been craving", adding that in Uruguay colours during the 2018 World Cup "he went about his job as the [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|deep-lying pivot]] in the middle of the park with none of the fuss and all of the discipline of a player who has built a tidy reputation for himself in Serie A", while assessing his chief weaknesses as a lack of height in aerial duels and little goal threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal transfer news: This is what Lucas Torreira will bring to Unai Emery's midfield, World Cup 2018 scouting report|first=Jack|last=Austin|work=The Independent|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=12 July 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-transfer-news-lucas-torreira-who-profile-tactics-world-cup-2018-scouting-report-uruguay-a8440601.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WhoScored notes that he is a player that likes to shoot from distance and often gets fouled. They also note that he likes to play short passes and make tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/248109/Show/Lucas-Torreira|title=Lucas Torreira  Football Statistics |website=WhoScored.com|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephan Lichtsteiner''' ({{IPA-de|lɪçtʃtaɪnər}}; born 16 January 1984) is a Swiss professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the  [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]]. An attacking [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], he is known for his energetic runs down the [[Midfielder#Winger|right wing]], as well as his stamina and athleticism, which have earned him the nicknames "[[Forrest Gump]]" and "The Swiss [[Express train|Express]]".&lt;ref name="champ"/&gt;

He began his professional career with [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]], winning a league title in 2002–03, and moved to [[Lille OSC|Lille]] in 2005, helping the French club to Champions League qualification in his first season with the team. In 2008, he joined Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], and won both the [[Coppa Italia]] and [[Supercoppa Italiana]] the following year. In 2011, he signed for [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a fee of €10 million. He played 257 total games for the Turin side over seven years and won 14 trophies, including the [[Serie A]] title in each of his seasons with the team. In the summer of 2018, he was signed by Arsenal.

A full international since 2006, Lichtsteiner has earned over [[100 caps]] for Switzerland, making him their third most capped player of all time. He has represented his country at two [[UEFA European Championship]]s and three [[FIFA World Cup]]s.

==Early years==
Lichtsteiner was born in [[Adligenswil]], [[Canton of Lucerne]] and played for the local football club. He left home as a teenager to play for [[Grasshopper Zürich]] and made his first team debut in [[2001–02 Nationalliga A|2001–02]] in the former Nationalliga A (now the [[Swiss Super League]]) but only made one league appearance. The following season, he began to establish himself as a first team regular and helped the club to the league title. While living in [[Zürich]] he completed a banking apprenticeship with [[Credit Suisse]] but ultimately chose a career in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Down-to-Earth Powerhouse|url=https://www.credit-suisse.com/sg/en/about-us/sponsorship/football/news.article.html/article/pwp/news-and-expertise/2013/10/en/portrait-lichtsteiner.html|publisher=[[Credit Suisse|credit-suisse.com]]|date=15 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714141048/https://www.credit-suisse.com/sg/en/about-us/sponsorship/football/news.article.html/article/pwp/news-and-expertise/2013/10/en/portrait-lichtsteiner.html|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Lille===
During the 2004–05 season Lichtsteiner sealed a transfer to [[Lille OSC]] as one of five Swiss players to enter [[Ligue 1]] during the summer of 2005. He became a regular in his first season and helped Lille to a third-place finish to secure a Champions League spot. His last season ended disappointingly as Lille finished seventh in the league and missed out on European football next season just by a point. However he did end with 4 goals, his highest tally so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lichtsteiner: We can progress|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=758086.html|publisher=[[FIFA|fifa.com]]|date=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lazio===
After some good performances at [[UEFA Euro 2008]], several clubs, including [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], expressed interest in signing Lichtsteiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lichtsteiner vers la Lazio|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2008/20080717_152319_lichtsteiner-vers-la-lazio_Dev.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703012343/http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2008/20080717_152319_lichtsteiner-vers-la-lazio_Dev.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2012|publisher=[[L'Équipe]]|date=17 July 2008|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected PSG's bid and, in July, signed a four-year contract with Italian side [[S.S. Lazio]] for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of €1.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piazzadellaliberta.it/2008/07/16/calciomercato-lazio-preso-lichtsteiner/#more-8381|title=Calciomercato Lazio: preso Lichtsteiner|work=piazzadellalibertà.it|accessdate=16 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080717012353/http://www.piazzadellaliberta.it/2008/07/16/calciomercato-lazio-preso-lichtsteiner/#more-8381 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 July 2008|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement for fellow Swiss international [[Valon Behrami]], who went to [[West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio è arrivato lo svizzero Lichtsteiner|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/Notizie/Calcio/36704/Lazio%2C+%C3%A8+arrivato+lo+svizzero+Lichtsteiner|publisher=Corriere Dello Sport|date=16 July 2008|language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the April [[Derby della Capitale]] against cross-city rivals [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], he scored his first goal to put Lazio 3–1 up in a heated derby encounter, which ended in a 4–2 win to Lazio, and resulted in numerous bookings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Championnat d'Italie: Lichtsteiner à la fête dans le derby romain|url=http://www.lematin.ch/flash-info/sport/championnat-italie-lichtsteiner-fete-derby-romain|publisher=[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]|date=11 April 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtsteiner himself was also booked for a heated confrontation with Roma defender [[Christian Panucci]], after the Italian had fouled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4070089|title=WGATU: Rivalries boil-over on the pitch|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, Lichtsteiner formed an attacking tandem down the flanks with Serbian international full-back [[Aleksandar Kolarov]] on the other side of the pitch. Although Lazio finished tenth, they ended the season on a high by winning the [[2008–09 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], and thus earning a place in the [[UEFA Europa League]] the next season. He played a part in Lazio's successful campaign, scoring in the penalty shoot-out against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in the [[2009 Coppa Italia Final|final]], and also claimed the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] at the beginning of the next season. After Kolarov's departure, his future at Lazio became increasingly in doubt, as several clubs expressed interest in him. At the end of the 2010–11 season, he opted not to see out the final year of his contract, despite the ''Biancocelesti'' qualifying for the Europa League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conte key for Lichtsteiner|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/930775/stephan-lichtsteiner-says-antonio-conte-was-key-to-juventus-switch?cc=3436|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juventus===
[[File:Stephan Lichtsteiner'13.JPG|thumb|upright|Lichtsteiner playing for Juventus in December 2013]]
On 27 June 2011, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] confirmed that Lichtsteiner had undergone a medical in [[Turin]] and reached an agreement with Lazio to pay €10 million in three installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lichtsteiner non-ha dubbi "La Juve è sempre la Juve"|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Juventus/10-07-2011/lichtsteiner-non-ha-dubbi-801947977793.shtml|publisher=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]|date=10 July 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was confirmed on 1 July 2011. He marked his debut on 11 September 2011 against [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] by scoring the first goal in the 4–1 home victory, the first league goal to be scored in Juventus' new [[Juventus Stadium|stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juventus Stadium|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1966779.html|publisher=UEFA.com|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Juventus went on to win the ''Scudetto'' and he played a vital part in their strong defensive record, only missing a handful of matches through injury and suspensions.&lt;ref name="champ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Champions of Italy: Stephan Lichtsteiner|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/7june2012_lich_campioni|publisher=juventus.com|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lichtsteiner repeated his opening matchday feat the following season by converting his left-sided counterpart [[Kwadwo Asamoah]]'s pass in the 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lightning strikes twice for Lichtsteiner|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/25ago2012_licht_eng|publisher=juventus.com|date=26 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828062342/http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/25ago2012_licht_eng|archivedate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played fewer matches during [[2013–14 Serie A|2013–14 season]] due to injuries but contributed three goals in all competitions and won his third consecutive [[Serie A]] title. His [[Cross (football)|crossing]] and ball-playing ability from the right flank, as well as his ability to make attacking runs to get on the end of [[Andrea Pirlo]]'s long passes, came to the fore as a right-sided wing-back in [[Antonio Conte|Conte's]] [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2 formation]].&lt;ref name="Lichtsteiner is vital to Juventus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/2152566/headline|title=Stephan Lichtsteiner is vital to Juventus' style of play|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Mina Rzouki|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he finished the season as Juventus's top assist-maker in the league, alongside [[Paul Pogba]], with eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/juventus-team-stats?competition=3&amp;season=2013&amp;category=STANDARD|title=2013-14 Juventus Serie A Statistics and Leaders: Standard|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/it/squadre/prima-squadra/difensori/stephan-lichtsteiner/index.php|title=Stephan Lichtsteiner|publisher=juventus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2015, Lichtsteiner started for Juventus in the [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final]] as the team were defeated 3–1 by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] at Berlin's [[Olympiastadion Berlin|Olympiastadion]]; he was involved in [[Álvaro Morata]]'s temporary equalising goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000552/match=2015227/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Barcelona see off Juventus to claim fifth title|date=6 June 2015|work=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2015, Lichtsteiner was substituted at half time during a league match against [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] due to breathing difficulty. It was later necessary for heart surgery to be performed to correct [[cardiac arrhythmia]], which caused him to be out for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/73851/surgeon-one-month-lichtsteiner|title=Surgeon: 'One month for Lichtsteiner' - Football Italia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2015, Lichtsteiner returned from injury, starting against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|2015–16 Champions League]] and scoring the equalizing goal in the 44th minute of a 1–1 away draw;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/04/juventus-stephan-lichsteiner-heart-surgery-return-goal|title=Juventus' Stephan Lichtsteiner marks heart surgery return with volleyed goal|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the goal was later voted one of the best goals of the tournament that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2391294.html|title=Top ten goals of the 2015/16 Champions League|publisher=UEFA.com|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 2016–17 season, Lichtsteiner was excluded from Juventus's squad for the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] group stage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2016/juventus-submits-champions-league-squad.php|title=Juventus submits Champions League squad|publisher=Juventus F.C.|date=1 September 2016|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was due to the fact that the club had signed rightback [[Dani Alves]], and had already filled their squad quota, as Juventus were also required to have four club youth products in the 25-men squad, even though initially the only former youth product in the first team was [[Claudio Marchisio]]. Thus, Lichtsteiner was excluded to make way for other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2016/marotta-analyses--satisfying--summer-.php|title=Marotta analyses 'satisfying' summer|publisher=Juventus F.C.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2400510.html|title=UEFA Champions League squads: how it works|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juventus had also re-signed [[Juan Cuadrado]] on loan, which meant that Lichsteiner would face competition for the starting right fullback/wingback/winger position, leading to rumours that he would be leaving the club; nevertheless, he later stated that he would be remaining with Juventus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/juventus/story/2942565/juventus-omit-stephan-lichsteiner-from-champions-league-squad|title=Juventus omit Stephan Lichsteiner from Champions League squad|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Ben Gladwell|date=2 September 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/90772/lichtsteiner-pledges-juve|title=Lichtsteiner pledges to Juve|publisher=Football Italia|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite competition for a starting spot, Lichtsteiner took part in the [[2016 Supercoppa Italiana]] on 23 December 2016, as one of the starting eleven, as Juventus lost to [[A.C.

On 7 March 2018, Lichtsteiner made his 250th appearance for Juventus in a 2–1 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], in the second leg of the round of 16 of the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], coming off the bench in the second half to help create [[Gonzalo Higuaín]]'s goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43306558|title=Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Juventus|publisher=BBC Sport|author1=Phil McNulty|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/tottenham-juventus-champions-league-match-report-paulo-dybala-gonzalo-higuain-a8244981.html|title=Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain stun Tottenham to send Juventus into Champions League quarter-finals|publisher=The Independent|author1=Luke Brown|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/tottenham-juve-talking-points.php|title=Tottenham-Juve: Talking Points|publisher=Juventus F.C.|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his 200th Serie A appearance with the club in a 3–1 home win over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 5 May, after which he announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/mercato/juventus/juve-lichtsteiner-scudetto-e-addio-lascio-a-fine-stagione-giochero-all-estero-_1212165-201802a.shtml |title=Juve - Lichtsteiner, scudetto e addio: "Lascio a fine stagione, giocherò all'estero" |publisher=www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it |language=Italian |date=6 May 2018 |accessdate=28 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May, Lichtsteiner made his final appearance for Juventus in the last match of the season in a 2–1 home win over [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Verona]] as the club celebrated winning their seventh consecutive league title; during the same match, he missed a penalty, and was given a send-off later during the game when he came off, despite Juventus having already made all three substitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beinsports.com/us/serie-a/video/juventus-bid-farewell-to-buffon-in-win-over-v/878156|title=Juventus Bid Farewell To Buffon In Win Over Verona|publisher=www.beinsports.com|date=19 May 2018|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former youth international, Lichtsteiner played in the [[1999 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship|1999 U16]] and the [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2004 U21 European Championships]]. He was first called up to the [[Switzerland national football team|senior squad]] on two occasions in 2005 but was an unused substitute both times. On 11 November 2006, he made his senior debut in a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] which ended in a 2–1 loss.

Although he missed out on the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Lichtsteiner was given a chance to prove himself as first choice right back [[Philipp Degen]] was out with long-term injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liege-Einheit für Stephan Lichtsteiner|url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/sport/aktuell/lichtsteiner_unterzieht_sich_einer_therapie_1.569792.html|publisher=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=15 October 2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, [[Köbi Kuhn]] named him in the squad for the [[Euro 2008]]. He played every match at the tournament and eventually replaced Degen as first choice right back. Switzerland ended the tournament with two losses and a win. He retained his starting place under new manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] and played every minute in 8 of the 10 [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifiers]].

Lichtsteiner played seven games in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]], with the Swiss failing to reach the finals in Poland and Ukraine. He scored his first international goal on 11 October 2010 in the final game, a 2–0 win over [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] in [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=James |first1=Andy |title=Switzerland end on a high against Montenegro |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15171/match=2002284/postmatch/report/index.html#switzerland+finish+high |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=UEFA |date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]], he played eight full matches in a successful campaign, scoring two first-half goals on 6 September 2013 in a 4–4 draw with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] at the [[Stade de Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eight-goal thriller in Bern |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/switzerland-vs-iceland/report/253629 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Vladimir Petković]] named him in the 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|finals in Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Switzerland squad for 2014 World Cup: the 23 chosen by Ottmar Hitzfeld |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/06/switzerland-world-cup-squad-brazil-2014 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played every minute in a run to the last 16.

Due to injury to regular captain [[Gökhan Inler]], Lichtsteiner wore the Swiss armband for the first time on 14 October 2014 in his 70th match, a 4–0 away win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lichtsteiner: "Von alleine fällt der Ball nicht rein" |url=https://www.srf.ch/sport/fussball/nationalmannschaft/lichtsteiner-von-alleine-faellt-der-ball-nicht-rein |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=SRF |date=14 October 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[UEFA Euro 2016|finals in France]] Lichtsteiner was made permanent captain as Inler was dropped due to lack of playing time at club level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Switzerland captain Stephan Lichtsteiner|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/euro-2016/interview-with-switzerland-captain-stephan-lichtsteiner-375261|work=[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]]|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss made it out of the group stage and faced [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the Round of 16. With the score at 1–1, the match was decided by [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]], and Lichtsteiner took first and scored but the Swiss lost as [[Granit Xhaka]] missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Neil |title=Switzerland 1&amp;ndash;1 Poland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36566078 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Lichtsteiner scored in home wins over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], as the Swiss qualified through the play-offs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Switzerland down Faroe Islands to stay perfect |url=https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/switzerland-down-faroe-islands-to-stay-perfect |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=SBS |date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Switzerland down Andorra to maintain perfect record |url=https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/switzerland-down-andorra-to-maintain-perfect-record |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=SBS |date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chessex |first1=Robin |title=La Nati a cru une heure à la qualification |url=https://www.20min.ch/ro/sports/football/story/La-Nati-a-cru-une-heure-a-la-qualification-25735498?httpredirect |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=20 minutes |date=8 October 2017 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in  Petković's 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|finals]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2018 World Cup: Switzerland name Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri in squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44360966 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June, in the final warm-up game against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], he became the fourth Swiss to earn [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|100 international caps]] in the 2–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orimolade |first1=Akindélé |title=Lichtsteiner est centenaire |url=https://fr.besoccer.com/info/lichtsteiner-puissance-100-443237 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=BeSoccer |date=8 June 2018 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fined 5,000 [[Swiss franc]]s after the 2–1 group win over [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] for his part in the controversial goal celebrations of [[Xherdan Shaqiri]] and [[Granit Xhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Switzerland trio avoid bans for 'eagle gesture' goal celebrations |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44606965 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A dynamic, hard-working, consistent, and versatile defender, Lichtsteiner is capable of playing anywhere along the right flank, and has been deployed as an attacking [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]] in a four-man back-line, or also as [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] in a 3–5–2 formation. Although he predominantly plays on the right, he has also been used on the left flank on occasion, or even as a makeshift [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]]. A quick, physically strong, tenacious, and tactically intelligent player, he is known for his energetic runs up and down the wing, which enable him to exploit spaces and get on the end of long balls, thus enabling him to help out at both ends of the pitch and cover the right flank effectively. His stamina, dedication and athleticism have earned him the nicknames "[[Forrest Gump]]" and "The Swiss [[Express train|Express]]".&lt;ref name="champ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunners struggle vs. Man City"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/arsenal/359/blog/post/3594617/arsenals-uncomfortable-petr-cech-earns-5-10-as-gunners-struggle-vs-man-city |title=Arsenal's uncomfortable Petr Cech earns 5/10 as Gunners struggle vs. Man City |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=James McNicholas |date=12 August 2018 |accessdate=26 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11583684/rob-holdings-knee-surgery-went-well-says-arsenal-defender |title=Rob Holding's knee surgery 'went well' says Arsenal defender |publisher=Sky Sports |author1=Lyall Thomas |date=16 December 2018 |accessdate=12 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not particularly skilful from a technical standpoint, he is capable of linking up with teammates and making attacking runs to get on the end of passes, which enable him to get into positions from which he can create chances for strikers with crosses from the touchline, or even score goals himself; while he is mainly regarded for his offensive contribution, he is also known for being reliable defensively. However, at times Lichsteiner has also drawn criticism in the media for lacking composure under pressure, being too rash and aggressive in his challenges, and prone to defensive errors, as well as for being inconsistent in his crossing and distribution from the right wing.&lt;ref name="Lichtsteiner is vital to Juventus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Juventus/09-11-2012/isla-scusate-ritardo-juve-turbo-destra--913164517005.shtml|title=Isla, scusate il ritardo Juve, il turbo sulla destra|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Riccardo Pratesi|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/27593/full-steam-ahead-lichtsteiner|title=Full steam ahead for Lichtsteiner|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Antonio Labbate|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Juventus/06-02-2014/juventus-lichtsteiner-universale-terzino-esterno-goleador-8019316751.shtml|title=Juventus, Lichtsteiner l'universale: terzino, esterno e goleador|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2014/09/29/5141848/editoriale-difende-come-un-difensore-attacca-come-un|title=Difende come un difensore, attacca come un attaccante: Lichtsteiner, l'arma in più della Juventus|publisher=Goal.com|author=Renato Maisani|language=Italian|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/calciomercato/2011/06/27-132271/Juve,+arriva+Lichtsteiner%3A+visite+mediche,+poi+la+firma|title=Juve, arriva Lichtsteiner: visite mediche, poi la firma|publisher=Tutto Sport|author=Marina Salvetti|language=Italian|date=27 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111335/http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/calciomercato/2011/06/27-132271/Juve,+arriva+Lichtsteiner:+visite+mediche,+poi+la+firma|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/758/086/index.html|title=Lichtsteiner: We can progress|publisher=FIFA.com|date=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lichtsteiner is married to Manuela Markworth, an economist and fitness instructor. They have a daughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephan Lichtsteiner ist Papa geworden|url=http://www.glanzundgloria.sf.tv/Nachrichten/Archiv/2011/02/06/Schweiz/Stephan-Lichtsteiner-ist-Papa-geworden|publisher=[[Schweizer Fernsehen]]|date=6 February 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Er ist Vater geworden!|url=http://www.schweizer-illustrierte.ch/stars/schweiz/er-ist-vater-geworden-0|publisher=[[Schweizer Illustrierte]]|date=5 February 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby Nummer 2: Nati-Star Stephan Lichtsteiner im Papa-Glück |url=http://www.srf.ch/unterhaltung/people/schweiz/baby-nummer-2-nati-star-stephan-lichtsteiner-im-papa-glueck|publisher=[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|srf.ch]]|date=29 October 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtsteiner acquired the nickname "[[Forrest Gump]]" from Lazio-supporting Radio Sei commentator Guido de Angelis after making a run down his flank to score in the 4–2 derby victory over crosstown rivals [[A.S. Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Forrest Gump" Lichtsteiner trifft – Kommentator dreht durch|url=http://www.blick.ch/sport/fussball/international/serie-a/lichtsteiner-trifft-im-roemer-derby-116668|publisher=[[Blick]]|date=12 April 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; His runs and athleticism has also earned him the nickname "The Swiss Express" since moving to Juventus.

He was first involved in a [[first-team]] match as an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 25 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Results/matches: 2013/14 |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=142&amp;teamTabs=results&amp;season_id=143 |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a long-term contract with Arsenal in October 2015.&lt;ref name="Alex Iwobi signs new contract"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.overview.html/alex-iwobi-2 |title=Profile |accessdate=13 October 2015 |publisher=Premier League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2015, Iwobi made his first-team debut for the club, starting in a 3–0 defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the Round of 16 of the League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34654548 |title=Arsene Wenger 'used too many senior players' in League Cup exit |date=28 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34578025 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 3–0 Arsenal |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |author=Luke Reddy |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut four days later in a 3–0 win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] at the [[Liberty Stadium]], as a stoppage time substitute for [[Mesut Özil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34623949 |title=Swansea City 0–3 Arsenal |date=31 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |author=Dafydd Pritchard |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwobi made his [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut as an 85th-minute substitute in a 5–1 defeat against Bayern Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34892626 |title=Bayern Munich 5–1 Arsenal |date=4 November 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwobi started in the first team for the [[2015–16 FA Cup]] 3rd and 4th round home wins against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Critchley |first1=Mark |title=Arsenal vs Sunderland team news: Alex Iwobi handed first-team chance, Petr Cech starts in goal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/arsenal-vs-sunderland-team-news-alex-iwobi-handed-first-team-chance-petr-cech-starts-in-goal-a6803886.html |accessdate=1 February 2016 |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hytner |first1=David |title=Arsène Wenger makes England quip over Arsenal's in-form Alex Iwobi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/31/arsene-wenger-england-arsenal-alex-iwobi-roy-hodgson-burnley-fa-cup |accessdate=1 February 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After getting a first Champions League start in a 3–1 away defeat to Barcelona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35814925 |title=Champions League: Barcelona 3–1 Arsenal (agg 5–1) |date=16 March 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwobi went on to score two goals in his first two Premier League starts in wins against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35792188 |title=Everton 0–2 Arsenal |date=19 March 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35902639 |title=Arsenal 4–0 Watford |date=2 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following season, Iwobi changed his squad number from 45 to 17. This was due to Chilean forward [[Alexis Sánchez]] taking up the newly vacated number 7 from the departing [[Tomáš Rosický]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/english-premier-league/story/2881382/granit-xhaka-to-wear-arsenal-no-16-shirt-alex-iwobi-to-wear-no-17 |title=Granit Xhaka to wear Arsenal No. 16 shirt, Alex Iwobi takes over No. 17 |date=27 May 2016 |publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iwobi went on to feature throughout Arsenal's victorious [[2016–17 FA Cup|FA Cup campaign of 2016–17]]. As so he earned a winners medal as being part of the squad that beat Chelsea by 2 goals to 1 in the [[2016-17 FA Cup|final of such]].&lt;ref name=FACup /&gt; He achieved further success with Arsenal in the [[2017 FA Community Shield|2017 Community Shield]], in which Arsenal beat Chelsea on penalties.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-au/amp/news/lets-keep-it-going-iwobi-lauds-arsenal-after-community/1gyizgop73z4s1v9kp2jfxd23j |title='Let's keep it going' – Iwobi lauds ARSENAL after Community Shield Triumph |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, after Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] announced he would be leaving the club, Iwobi described him as an "inspiration" and stated it was sad but exciting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43988015 |title=Nigeria's Alex Iwobi says Wenger exit 'sad' and 'exciting' |date=3 May 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 he signed a new long-term contract with the club, reportedly until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45060242|title=Alex Iwobi: Arsenal midfielder signs new 'long-term' deal|date=3 August 2018|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Alex Iwobi-Nigeria.jpg|thumb|upright|Iwobi with [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in 2017]]

Iwobi started as a youth international for England, with whom he won the [[Victory Shield]] of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/all-teams/players/i/alex-iwobi |title=Profile |accessdate=11 October 2015 |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/26/arsenal-alex-iwobi-england-nigeria |title=How Arsenal's Alex Iwobi became England's loss and Nigeria's gain |date=26 March 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trophy /&gt; Iwobi went on though to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. He made his senior debut for the Super Eagles on 8 October 2015, replacing [[Ahmed Musa (footballer)|Ahmed Musa]] in the 57th minute of a 2–0 friendly defeat to [[DR Congo national football team|DR Congo]] in [[Visé]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34497630 |title=Arsenal's Alex Iwobi encouraged by Nigeria opportunity |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015 |author=Oluwashina Okeleji |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected by Nigeria for their 35-man provisional squad for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36623763 |title=Kelechi Iheanacho included in Nigeria's Olympics squad |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016 |author=Oluwashina Okeleji |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a part of the 18-man final squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/teams/team=1889763/players.html |title=Olympic Football Tournament Rio 2016 - Nigeria |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 Iwobi pulled out of Nigeria's squad for that month's World Cup qualifiers due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41068525 |title=Iwobi ruled out of Nigeria's World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon |date=27 August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2017, Iwobi scored for Nigeria in a 1–0 win over Zambia to secure the Super Eagles a spot in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://punchng.com/iwobi-sends-nigeria-to-russia-2018/ |title=Iwobi sends Nigeria to Russia 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named in Nigeria's 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44346451|title=World Cup 2018: Arsenal's Iwobi in Nigeria's 23-man squad|date=3 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the team needed to learn from its performance after going out in the group stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44888104|title=Alex Iwobi: Nigeria must learn from 2018 World Cup|date=19 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In January 2018 a video allegedly showing Iwobi at a late-night party 36 hours before a match was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42617708|title=Alex Iwobi: Arsenal forward faces fine over pre-match party claims|date=5 May 2018|accessdate=1 February 2019|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, Iwobi was the subject of alleged racism from Indian actress [[Esha Gupta]], an Arsenal ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-47042681|title=Esha Gupta: Has Instagram exposed everyday racism in India?|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2009, Monreal was selected to the [[Spain national football team|senior side]] for the first time, for an [[exhibition game]] with [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/monreal-oportunidad-algo-magico/20090806dasdasftb_30/Tes|title=Monreal: "Esta oportunidad es algo mágico para mí"|trans-title=Monreal: "This is a magical opportunity for me"|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|language=Spanish|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the last 15 minutes for [[Joan Capdevila]] in a 3–2 away success;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/deportes/futbol-00162/noticia-futbol-seleccion-cronica-macedonia-espana-20090812233357.html|title=Crónica del Macedonia-España: 2–3.|trans-title=Macedonia-Spain match report: 2–3.|publisher=[[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]]|language=Spanish|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 September 2010, in the nation's second game after they won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]], he played the entire 1–4 friendly loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/deportes/futbol-00162/noticia-futbol-seleccion-cronica-argentina-espana-20100908000609.html|title=Crónica del Argentina – España, 4–1|trans-title=Argentina – Spain match report, 4–1|publisher=Europa Press|language=Spanish|date=8 September 2010|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monreal was a member of the Spanish squad which reached the final of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in Brazil, although he was second-choice left back behind [[FC Barcelona]]'s [[Jordi Alba]]. He started in the last two group games, beginning with a 10–0 win over [[Tahiti national football team|Tahiti]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]] in which he set up a [[David Villa]] goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22896367|title=Spain 10–0 Tahiti|publisher=BBC Sport|last1=Magowan|first1=Alistair|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We have three very good goalkeepers. Petr Čech, his performances for us have been very important and his experience. Leno can learn by staying near with Petr Čech every day. I am very happy with him. He has waited for his moment and it’s arriving."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45610319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/29/unai-emery-offers-update-on-petr-cech-injury-and-praises-replacement-bernd-leno-7990766/|title=Unai Emery updates on Petr Cech injury and rates Bernd Leno's league debut|first=Metro Sport|last=Reporter|date=29 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck''' (born 26 November 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]]. He primarily plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but can also play as a [[Left winger|winger]].

Welbeck made his way through the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth teams at Manchester United]] before making his senior debut in 2008 and scoring in the process. He was with United when they won the [[2008–09 Football League Cup|2008–09 League Cup]] and the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]] before being sent on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and more recently [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. From the 2011–12 season, Welbeck was a regular figure in the Manchester United first team. He was transferred to Arsenal in September 2014 for a £16&amp;nbsp;million fee.

He made his senior England debut in March 2011 in a 1–1 friendly draw against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], the homeland of both of his parents. He scored his first senior international goal on 2 June 2012, the only goal in a friendly victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Welbeck has gone on to represent England at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], earning over 30 caps.

He played in England's deciding [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier]] against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] on 7 October 2011, coming on as a substitute for [[Theo Walcott]] in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England squad for Montenegro clash |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/News/match-centre/2011/Montenegro-v-England/Match-Previews/england-squad-named |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120428075026/http://www.thefa.com/England/News/match-centre/2011/Montenegro-v-England/Match-Previews/england-squad-named |dead-url=yes |archivedate=28 April 2012 |publisher=The Football Association |date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2012, Welbeck was listed as a part of the confirmed 23-man squad for [[Roy Hodgson]]'s England squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. On 2 June 2012, he scored his first goal for England in a 1–0 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], with a chip over goalkeeper [[Simon Mignolet]] after collecting a through ball from his Manchester United teammate Ashley Young.&lt;ref name="England 1–0 Belgium"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |date=2 June 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18294160 |title=England 1–0 Belgium |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2012, Welbeck scored a backheeled winning goal in the 79th minute as England beat Sweden 3–2 in UEFA Euro 2012 in Kiev.&lt;ref name="Sweden 2–3 England"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |date=15 June 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18181790 |title=Sweden 2–3 England |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welbeck scored four goals in England's qualification for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], braces in two home matches: a 5–0 win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] on 12 October 2012&lt;ref name="England 5–0 San Marino"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19860360 |accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 4–0 victory against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] on 6 September 2013,&lt;ref name="England 4–0 Moldova"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=England 4–0 Moldova |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23921240 |accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up for the final squad for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/12/england-world-cup-squad-hodgson-barkley-sterling |title=England World Cup squad 2014: Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling called up |date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started in England's opening 2–1 defeat to Italy before being substituted for [[Ross Barkley]] after 61 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Italy 2–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285071 |accessdate=15 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welbeck also played England's second group match, a loss by the same score to Uruguay in which he was substituted for [[Adam Lallana]] for the last 19 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Uruguay 2–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285176 |accessdate=19 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2014, in England's first match of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification]], Welbeck scored both goals in a 2–0 victory away to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] at [[St. Jakob-Park]], [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="Switzerland 0–2 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Switzerland 0–2 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29008534 |accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored in matches against San Marino, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] to make him the top goalscorer in the qualifying phase with six goals from five matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/03/27/danny-welbeck-becomes-leading-goalscorer-in-euro-2016-qualifying-after-england-strike-against-lithuania-5124336/ |title=Danny Welbeck becomes leading goalscorer in Euro 2016 qualifying after England strike against Lithuania |date=28 March 2015 |newspaper=Metro |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During March 2018, Welbeck was selected for the national team for friendlies in preparation for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] alongside Arsenal teammate [[Jack Wilshere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/wilshere-and-welbeck-named-england-squad |title=Wilshere and Welbeck named in England squad}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named in the 23-man [[England national football team|England national team]] squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44138600 |title=England World Cup squad: Trent Alexander-Arnold in 23-man squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Due to his height and running style, Welbeck has been compared to former Arsenal strikers [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] and [[Nwankwo Kanu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbert |first=Ian |title=Welbeck the pick of United's latest crop |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/welbeck-the-pick-of-uniteds-latest-crop-1634182.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Danny Welbeck profile |url=http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/115271/danny-welbeck |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but styled his game on another former Arsenal forward, his boyhood hero [[Thierry Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prodigious United Talent Hails Arsenal Legend |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/prodigious-united-talent-hails-arsenal-legend/23110 |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been known for his work-rate and has been described as strong, quick, and very good in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Mathieson |title=Welbeck hopes to follow Hughes path |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/welbeck-hopes-to-follow-hughes-path-940658 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have acknowledged the strength in Welbeck's style of play such as his work-rate, pace and intelligence in following tactical command, especially after his performance in both of Manchester United's Champions League knock-out stage matches against Real Madrid in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Welbeck showed electric pace and intelligence... he didn't deserve to lose |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2288780/Manchester-United-v-Real-Madrid--Martin-Keown-Danny-Welbeck-showed-electric-pace-intelligence--didnt-deserve-lose.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=6 March 2013 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Keown}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welbeck has been praised as a big game player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathieson |first=Stuart |title=Ton-up Danny Welbeck the main man |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ton-up-danny-welbeck-main-man-2584423 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Greg |title=Three Reasons Why This Local Man Utd Lad Needs To Start vs City |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/moyes-play-him-three-reasons-why-this-local-lad-needs-to-start-vs-city/ |publisher=Squawka |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayward |first=Paul |title=Even in Manchester United's darkest days they find a way to hold their ground among the European elite |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10739086/Even-in-Manchester-Uniteds-darkest-days-they-find-a-way-to-hold-their-ground-among-the-European-elite.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August, he made his competitive debut in the final qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], as a 55th-minute substitute for the injured left-back [[Johan Djourou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/8704465/Arsenal-1-Udinese-0-match-report.html |title=Arsenal 1 Udinese 0: match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], four days later, starting at right back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1112/post/first-team/arsenal-0-0-liverpool-match-report |title=Arsenal 0–2 Liverpool – Match Report |first=Richard |last=Clarke |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson kept his place in the team, starting in the second leg against Udinese&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; and then in an eventful Premier League fixture against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].

With Sagna still unavailable through injury, Jenkinson was a regular starter in the first couple of months of the [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13 season]]. His performances improved, earning appreciation from teammates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arteta-full-backs-have-been-so-consistent |title=Arteta – Full backs have been so consistent |first=Chris |last=Harris |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922223230/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arteta-full-backs-have-been-so-consistent |archivedate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/9555832/Manchester-City-1-Arsenal-1-match-report.html |title=Manchester City 1 Arsenal 1: match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2018 |quote=The visiting supporters were treated to strong performances from Per Mertesacker at centre-half, the German's quick reading of the game making up for any slowness of movement, and the rapidly maturing right back Carl Jenkinson.}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/carl-jenkinson-impressing-england-to-backdrop-of-duel-over-nationality-nkzkfvmb0w8 |title=Carl Jenkinson impressing England to backdrop of duel over nationality |first=Matt |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2018 |quote=Jenkinson's vastly improved performances while deputising for Bacary Sagna this season have all but ensured he will play international football at some point, but the question is for whom? |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[England national football team|England]] manager.&lt;ref name="England Elect"/&gt;

Jenkinson and teammates [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]], [[Kieran Gibbs]], [[Aaron Ramsey]] and [[Jack Wilshere]] all signed new long-term contracts with Arsenal in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/five-young-internationals-sign-new-contracts |title=Five young internationals sign new contracts |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204726/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/five-young-internationals-sign-new-contracts |archivedate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made only six more appearances in the rest of the season;&lt;ref name=sb1213/&gt; in one of the six, a 1–0 win away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 9 February which he started only because [[Laurent Koscielny]] was injured in the warm-up, he was sent off after being booked twice for a "lunge" on [[Jack Colback]] and a "clumsy challenge" on [[Stéphane Sessègnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311614 |title=Sunderland 0–1 Arsenal |first=Neil |last=Johnston |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2013 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
Jenkinson featured in all three of Arsenal's opening matches of the 2013–14 campaign as injuries to defenders [[Thomas Vermaelen]] and Koscielny forced Sagna to fill in at centre-back and Jenkinson to deputise at right back.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Despite Koscielny later returning, Jenkinson kept his place in the first-team after impressing against [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magowan |first=Alistair |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23831033 |title=Arsenal 1–0 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====
Before the opening match of the [[2016–17 Arsenal F.C. season|2016–17 season]], [[Arsène Wenger]] stated that Jenkinson was expected to be fit for first-team action in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20160810/team-news-gabriel-jack-per-welbeck |title=Team news: Gabriel, Jack, Per, Welbeck |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=10 August 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for Arsenal since 2014 slightly ahead of schedule, on 25 October, starting at right back in the team's 2–0 League Cup win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref name=ReturnReading/&gt; He received plaudits for his performance{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and had a chance early on to open the scoring.&lt;ref name=ReturnReading&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/Arsenal-vs-Reading/367469 |title=Arsenal 2–0 Reading: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fires Gunners into last eight |first=Jack |last=Wilkinson |publisher=Sky Sports |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson played in four matches in November,&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; but after the last{{snd}}the League Cup quarter-final loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in which he made an error that cost Arsenal a goal and his substitution was cheered by Arsenal fans{{snd}}Wenger suggested that he lacked confidence and needed to regain his competitiveness away from the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38073806 |title=Arsenal 0–2 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/02/arsene-wenger-carl-jenkinson-arsenal-west-ham |title=Arsène Wenger to spare Carl Jenkinson the spotlight at West Ham |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=2 December 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson himself disagreed, and concluded that if he was out of the team, he needed to move to a club where he would play regularly.&lt;ref name=RecordStraight&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/09/carl-jenkinson-sets-record-straight-arsenal-future-crystal-palace/ |title=Carl Jenkinson sets record straight on Arsenal future and why Crystal Palace move broke down |first=Sam |last=Wallace |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the January 2017 transfer window, a fee was agreed for a permanent move to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], managed by [[Sam Allardyce]] with whom Jenkinson had worked at West Ham, but the player could not agree personal terms.&lt;ref name=RecordStraight/&gt; He remained at Arsenal for the rest of the season, but did not play for the first team.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt;

He was given squad number 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bcfc.com/news/articles/2017/blues-sign-arsenal-pair-on-loan/ |title=Blues sign Arsenal pair on loan |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=21 August 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson hoped that regular football would restart his stagnating career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-carl-jenkinson-makes-13522574 |title=Birmingham City's Carl Jenkinson makes vow after nightmare season at Arsenal |first=Alex |last=Dicken |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=25 August 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After half an hour of his debut, playing at right back five days later at home to Reading, Jenkinson dislocated a shoulder in collision with teammate [[Michael Morrison (footballer)|Michael Morrison]] and was expected to be "out long-term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/birmingham-city-transfer-news-rumours-13535532 |title=Birmingham City transfer news and rumours: Harry Redknapp's warchest; Carl Jenkinson injury update |first=Mat |last=Kendrick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=27 August 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return to the first team when he started the FA Cup tie against [[Huddersfield Town]] on 27 January 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-vs-huddersfield-town-14255220 |title=Birmingham City vs Huddersfield Town: Your bumper pre-match read |first=Steve |last=Wollaston |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=27 January 2018 |accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came back into the league starting eleven two weeks later, replacing the injured [[Jonathan Grounds]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Kolašinac began his career in his hometown club, [[Karlsruher SC]]. After eight years of playing for Kalsruhe, Kolašinac joined [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]], where he played a season before transferring to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. A season later, he joined [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/meet-bosnian-defender-hoping-stop-messi-and-aguero|title=Meet the Bosnian defender hoping to stop Messi and Aguero|magazine=FourFourTwo|date=9 June 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sead Kolašinac S04 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Kolašinac warming up for [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in 2015]]

After one season with the youth team, Kolašinac was promoted to the second team, [[FC Schalke 04 II|Schalke 04 II]], in one of the German lower leagues, [[Regionalliga West]]. After scoring two goals in seven matches, he was promoted to the first team. On 15 September 2012, he made his [[Bundesliga]] debut in a 2–0 win over [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|Greuther Fürth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2012-13/3/1441668/spielverlaufaufstellung_spvgg-greuther-fuerth-82_fc-schalke-04-2.html|title=Holtby nimmt Fürth endgültig den Mut|magazine=Kicker|date=15 September 2012|accessdate=5 July 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, he played in his first game in European competitions, a 1–1 draw against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]], in the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000347/match=2009578/postmatch/lineups/index.html|title=UEFA Champions League 2012/13 – History – Montpellier-Schalke Lineups|publisher=UEFA |date=4 December 2012|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 Kolašinac extended his contract with Schalke to June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2013/6/25/4464054/fc-schalke-04-extend-sead-kolasinacs-contract-through-2017|title=FC Schalke 04 extend Sead Kolasinac's contract through 2017 |website=SB Nation |publisher=Vox Media |date=25 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the following season Kolašinac [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore the anterior cruciate ligament]] of his right knee and was out for approximately six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhdragons.com/sead-kolasinac-sidelined-for-six-months/|title=Sead Kolasinac sidelined for six months|website=BHDragons|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolašinac scored his first goal for Schalke 04 on 13 December 2015, in a 1–1 draw against [[FC Augsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsport.ba/ino_fudbal/prvijenac-kolasinca-u-bundesligi/178603|title=Prvijenac Kolašinca u Bundesligi!|website=SportSport.ba|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=30 September 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Kolašinac made the decision not to renew his contract with Schalke 04, thus ending his six-year spell at German club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/sport/fussball-kolasinac-verlaesst-schalke-abloesefrei---poker-um-goretzka-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-170520-99-531812|title=Kolasinac verlässt Schalke ablösefrei|newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung |location=Munich |date=14 May 2017|accessdate=21 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[2016–17 Bundesliga|2016–17]] season, he was voted in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="Team of the Season 16/17 Results"&gt;{{cite web|title=Team of the Season 16/17 Results|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/tots/|publisher=Bundesliga|accessdate=30 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529015413/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/tots/|archive-date=29 May 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
On 6 June 2017, [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] confirmed the signing of Kolašinac on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]], pending the "completion of all regulatory processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20170606/sead-kolasinac-to-join-arsenal|title=Sead Kolasinac to sign for Arsenal |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=5 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolašinac scored on his debut against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2017 FA Community Shield]], which Arsenal won on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/aug/04/fa-community-shield-arsenal-chelsea-report-060817|title=Arsenal lift Community Shield|publisher=The Football Association |date=6 August 2017|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40766983|title=Arsenal 1–1 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2017|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut on the opening day, providing an assist in a 4–3 win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40822513|title=Arsenal 4–3 Leicester City|publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2017|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances in August, he was voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month, earning more than half of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/kolasinac-voted-august-player-month|title=Kolasinac voted August Player of the Month|publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=5 September 2017|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September, Kolašinac scored on his [[UEFA Europa League]] debut against [[1. FC Köln]], which Arsenal won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/14/arsenal-v-cologne-europa-league-live|title=Arsenal beat Cologne in delayed Europa League match|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=14 September 2017|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in the Premier League on 28 October against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], and also provided an assist for his team's other goal in a 2–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41703866|title=Arsenal 2–1 Swansea City|publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 October 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolašinac was once again voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month, in October, earning half of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/kolasinac-tops-october-player-month-poll|title=Kolasinac tops October Player of the Month poll|publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=13 November 2017|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Kolašinac has a [[German passport]] and after playing on various youth levels for [[Germany national football team|Germany]], he switched allegiance to his parents' homeland [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and received a call-up for the country's senior national team in 2013. His father stated in an interview that was always the player's first choice to play for the Bosnian national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/otac-seada-kolasinca-on-je-uvijek-zelio-igrati-za-bih/130704028|title=Otac Seada Kolašinca: On je uvijek želio igrati za BiH|website=Klix.ba|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=4 July 2013|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2013, Kolašinac made his debut for Bosnia in a 2–0 [[Exhibition game|friendly]] loss against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/s/en-us/match/argentina-vs-bosnia-herzegovina/1598647/preview|title=Argentina Bosnia 2–0|publisher=Goal.com|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in Bosnia's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/bosnia-and-herzegovina/10810419/Bosnia-Herzegovina-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 2014 World Cup squad|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third minute of the team's opening group match, Kolašinac scored an unfortunate [[own goal]], the fastest in World Cup history, as Argentina ran out 2–1 winners at the [[Maracanã Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285099|title=Argentina 2–1 BiH|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 June 2014|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Kolašinac is regarded as a versatile defender who can slot into all defensive positions as needed. At Schalke 04 II he was deployed mostly as a [[centre back]] or [[defensive midfielder]]. Schalke 04 head coach [[Jens Keller]] used Kolašinac mainly as a [[left back]], a position in which Kolašinac has distinguished himself. Physically strong and tactically clever, he consistently wins one-on-one duels against his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/sport/fussball/s04/schalke-talent-kolasinac-verteidigte-in-istanbul-knallhart-und-clever-id7646214.html|title=Schalke-Talent Kolasinac verteidigte in Istanbul knallhart und clever|website=Derwesten.de|date=21 February 2013|accessdate=4 September 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kolašinac was born in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], to [[Bosniak]] parents.&lt;ref name="mosque school"/&gt; He attended the [[Gesamtschule Berger Feld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://turkish-football.com/photo-arsenal-star-mesut-ozil-invites-former-school-to-spain-match-former-pupils-include-julian-draxler-manuel-neuer/ | title =Photo: Arsenal Star Invites Former School Students To Spain Match, Former Pupils Include Julian Draxler &amp; Manuel Neuer | last =Sarigul | first =Emre | date =27 March 2018 | publisher =Turkish-Football | access-date =25 July 2018 | quote =The school boasts an impressive alumni including Manuel Neuer, Julian Draxler, Benedikt Höwedes, Leroy Sané, Max Meyer, Ralf Ferryman, Joel Matip and Sead Kolasinac. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Faik, who works at a [[Mercedes-Benz]] factory, was born in [[Nikšić]], Montenegro, to parents from [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. The family moved to [[Čapljina]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1969, where Faik met his wife. Kolašinac and his family are practising [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="mosque school"/&gt;

As well as having a [[German passport]], Kolašinac was given a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina passport|Bosnian passport]] in 2013 so that he could play for the Bosnian national team.&lt;ref name="mosque school"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.ba/fudbal/sead-kolasinac-je-bjezao-iz-skole-kako-bi-isao-u-mekteb/|title=Sead Kolašinac je bježao iz škole kako bi išao u mekteb|website=SportSport.ba|date=11 November 2013|accessdate=11 November 2013|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolašinac is often referred to by fans as the "The Destroyer", "The Tank", or "The Bosnian Hulk", due to his robust, muscular frame and aggressive playing style.&lt;ref name="kolasinac nicknames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.squawka.com/en/news/the-bosnian-hulk-sead-kolasinac-reveals-preferred-nickname-to-new-arsenal-team-mates/957532|title=‘The Bosnian Hulk’ Sead Kolasinac reveals preferred nickname to new Arsenal team-mates|website=Squawka.com|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=22 December 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sead kolasinac nicknames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20170608/-the-bosnian-hulk-|title='The Bosnian Hulk'|website=Arsenal.com|date=9 June 2017|accessdate=22 December 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka played his first game for the [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|under-21 side]] on 3 September 2010, as a substitute, as the team beat the [[Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team|Republic of Ireland]] 1–0 at the [[Cornaredo Stadium]] in [[Lugano]].&lt;ref name=" Match report Switzerland 1-0 Republic of Ireland "&gt;{{cite web |last=UEFA.com |year=2010 |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season=2011/round=2000006/match=2000066/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816061752/http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season%3D2011/round%3D2000006/match%3D2000066/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2010 |title=Switzerland see off Ireland for play-off place |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last game in the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification Group 2|qualification Group 2]] to the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. Xhaka was member of the Swiss U-21 squad that competed in the final tournament, hosted by Denmark, between 11 and 25 June 2011. The Swiss team reached the final without conceding a goal, but lost to [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain]] 2–0.

Before making his international debut for [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or [[Albania national football team|Albania]], and he complained to the Albanian sports media that [[FSHF]] was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.&lt;ref name=Albaniasoccer1&gt;{{cite news |last=Begu |first=Yll |title=Në fokus / Granit Xhaka: Dua të luaj për Shqipërinë, por mungon interesimi i FSHF-së! |url=http://www.albaniasoccer.com/lajme/shqiperi/kombetarja/4627-ne-fokus--granit-xhaka-dua-te-luaj-per-shqiperine-por-mungon-interesimi-i-fshf-se.html |date=13 April 2011 |quote="Mesfushori i Bazelit, Granit Xhaka, së bashku me vëllanë e tij, Taulantin, kanë dëshirë për t'u bërë pjesë e kombëtares shqiptare, mirëpo deri më tash nuk kanë parë kurrfarë interesimi nga Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit që t'i afrojë ata në kombëtaren kuqezi.", further in the article Xhaka says: "“Në javët e fundit është bërë një presion i madh drejt nesh nga mediet lokale për të zgjedhur kombëtaren e Zvicrës dhe e kam të vështirë ta kuptoj përse askush nga FSHF-ja nuk ka reaguar për të shprehur interesim që ne të vishemi kuqezi”, ka theksuar Granit Xhaka.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka debuted for Switzerland at [[Wembley Stadium]] against [[England national football team|England]] in a 2–2 [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualification]] draw on 4 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Fulldebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://football.uk.reuters.com/leagues/uk/news/2011/06/04/LDE7530D0.php | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104620/http://football.uk.reuters.com/leagues/uk/news/2011/06/04/LDE7530D0.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 11 March 2012 |title=Below-par England salvage draw with Switzerland |agency=Reuters |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |last=Collett |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2011, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] at the [[Stade Josy Barthel]].&lt;ref name="sfv 3"&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.football.ch/nm/de/A_Team-telegramm.aspx?tg=1921952 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115214415/http://www.football.ch/nm/de/A_Team-telegramm.aspx?tg=1921952 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 January 2013 |title=Matchtelegram Luxembourg-Schweiz |publisher=football.ch |accessdate=15 November 2011 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland also tried to select Xhaka to participate in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics - Men's tournament|2012 Olympic Football tournament]], but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/09/oly-socc-swiss-squad-idUSB29215720120709 |title=Olympics-Shaqiri, Xhaka excluded from Swiss soccer squad |agency=Reuters |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in all ten of Switzerland's [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign]] matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]].&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=311558/played-matches.html |title=Granit XHAKA |accessdate=21 June 2014 |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] squad by national coach [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/switzerland/10810381/Switzerland-World-Cup-2014-squad.html |title=Switzerland World Cup 2014 squad |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207 |title=Switzerland 2–5 France |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=21 June 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his brother [[Taulant Xhaka|Taulant]] while their mother watched from the crowd in a T-shirt blending the two nations' flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gill |first1=Kieran |title=Granit and Taulant Xhaka go head to head at Euro 2016... as their mother wears a half-and-half Switzerland-Albania shirt and older brother throws a tantrum on the touchline |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3636643/Granit-Taulant-Xhaka-head-head-Euro-2016-mother-wears-half-half-Switzerland-Albania-shirt-older-brother-throws-tantrum-touchline.html |accessdate=11 June 2016 |work=Daily Mail |date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted the [[man of the match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Atkin |first1=John |title=Switzerland hold on against ten-man Albania |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000448/match=2017878/postmatch/report/index.html |accessdate=25 June 2016 |publisher=UEFA |date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the round of 16 with a loss to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at the [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]]; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]], shooting wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brassell |first1=Andy |title=Poland hold nerve after Switzerland's Granit Xhaka blazes penalty wide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/25/switzerland-poland-euro-2016-match-report |accessdate=25 June 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup qualifiers]], there was speculation that Xhaka could switch his allegiance to represent [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], which had been accepted as a full member of [[FIFA]] and were allowed to play competitive matches for the first time. Xhaka, however, published an open letter stating that his participation in Euro 2016 had disqualified him from changing his allegiance, and he was thus tied to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://talentet.eu/2016/08/30/leter-e-hapur-nga-granit-xhaka/ |title=Letër e hapur nga Granit XHAKA – TALENTËT |website=talentet.eu|access-date=6 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905024345/http://talentet.eu/2016/08/30/leter-e-hapur-nga-granit-xhaka/|archive-date=5 September 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka was named in manager [[Vladimir Petković]]'s 23-man Swiss squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2018 World Cup: Switzerland name Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri in squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44360966 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, he equalised with a long-range strike as the Swiss came from behind to defeat [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] 2–1 in their second game.

'''Dominic "Dom" Thompson''' is a fictional character on the [[New Zealand]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Shortland Street]]'' who was portrayed by [[Shane Cortese]] from 2003 to 2004.

Dom arrived as the brother of established character [[Toni Thompson]] (Laura Hill) however soon after arrival, was revealed as the half brother of [[Chris Warner]] ([[Michael Galvin]]). Initially appearing as a protagonist, Dom soon developed into a much more sinister character who was key to several high-profile storylines. These included his marriage to [[Emily Bredican]] (Sarah Somerville), affair with 16-year-old [[Delphi Greenlaw]] ([[Anna Hutchison]]), a rivalry with Chris Warner after discovering they were not related, murdering [[Geoff Greenlaw]] ([[Andrew Laing]]), his controversial return on the shows 3000th episode, his murder of Avril Lucich (Kate Louise-Elliott) and a dramatic conclusion episode in December 2004 that saw Dom die after trying to murder Chris.

Dom's two-year-long stint saw the show receive huge ratings and the period be remembered as a well done and iconic season. The character remains mentioned and referred to as a menacing and monumental character who brought the show back its excitement.

==Creation and casting==
After auditioning for Geoff Greenlaw and losing out to [[Andrew Laing]], [[Shane Cortese]] learned producers had created a character specifically for him to be the brother of a major character and it was undecided whether the character would be "good or bad".&lt;ref name=badguy&gt;{{cite web|work=NZonscreen |title=Shane Cortese on being a badguy |date=March 2011|publisher=[[NZ On Air]]|author=Coleman, James|url=http://screentalk.nzonscreen.com/interviews/shane-cortese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese made his debut as Dom in early 2003 under a yearlong contract with the potential of another 12 month expansion.&lt;ref name=badguy/&gt; The character stayed on screen for a year and departed in early 2004. Producers offered Cortese the chance to return on the show's 3000th episode under a contract that would see him continue with the show until mid-2005.&lt;ref name=scumbag&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing Shortland Street's scumbag isn't all good fun|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3580666|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=July 2004|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Barry, Rebecca|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese accepted and returned to the show on the momentous 3000th episode.&lt;ref name=jawdrop&gt;{{cite news|title=What a nasty surprise for amorous Dr Warner|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3574399|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Grant, Frances|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=24 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character ended up getting killed off later in the year.&lt;ref name=aisles&gt;{{cite news|title=Return to the shaky aisles on Shortland Street|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=9003160|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=December 2004|accessdate=1 November 2011|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|author=Barry, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Dom arrived to visit his sister [[Toni Warner|Toni]] (Laura Hill) and quickly got a job at the hospital. He mysteriously got on well with rival [[Chris Warner|Chris]]' ([[Michael Galvin]]) mother - [[Margot Warner]] (Dinah Priestley) and when she died, Dom revealed himself as Chris' illegitimate half brother. Taking up the Warner surname, Dom married [[Emily Bredican|Emily]] (Sarah Somerville) and fought attractions to teenager - [[Delphi Greenlaw]] ([[Anna Hutchison]]). Following a blood test, Dom realized he was not related to Chris but kept it a secret whilst he started an affair with Delphi. To hide the affair, he drugged his wife and soon became a suspect in the murder of [[Geoff Greenlaw|Geoff]] ([[Andrew Laing]]) who had discovered the affair. Once Chris discovered the truth, Dom circulated rumours he was a child molestor. Dom and Delphi planned to run away but Delphi discovered Dom had killed Geoff and a desperate Dom fled Ferndale.

Dom returned later in 2004, having started a relationship with [[Lucy Swinton|Lucy]] (Sally Stockwell). He managed to successfully avoid capture in relation to Geoff's murder and when [[Avril Lucich|Avril]] (Kate Louise-Elliot) began snooping, he drowned her in his bath tub. When the staff started to turn against Dom after Avril's sister [[Bernadette Lucich|Bernadette]] (Kate Louise-Elliot) accused him of murder, he faked mental illness and after escaping a psych ward, he lured Chris to a barn and tried to set him on fire. Unsuccessful, Dom ended up getting caught in a large explosion. With intense burns, Dom finally admitted to killing Geoff and Avril before he died in Toni's arms.

==Character development==

===Relationship with Delphi Greenlaw===
In 2003 Dom underwent a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old [[Delphi Greenlaw]]. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful."&lt;ref name=suds&gt;{{cite news|title=More suds in the soap|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3451964|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=May 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Grant, Frances|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects him in a way no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him."&lt;ref name=suds/&gt; Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi."&lt;ref name=aisles/&gt; The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss.&lt;ref name=powerpoint&gt;{{cite news|title=Powerpoint: Back on the home front|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3351598|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines.&lt;ref name=echoes&gt;{{cite news|title=Soapland echoes to sounds of wailing|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3533134|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=November 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Dixon, Greg|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigbangswhimpers&gt;{{cite news|title=Big bangs, and a few whimpers on telly in 2003|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3540918|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=December 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Rae, Fiona|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whodunnit&gt;{{cite web|title=Who killed Geoff Greenlaw? |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/429383?format=html |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |year=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014094717/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/429383?format=html |archivedate=14 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons.

'''David Ospina Ramírez''' ({{IPA-es|daˈβið osˈpina raˈmiɾes}}, born 31 August 1988) is a Colombian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]  for [[Serie A]] club [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], on loan from {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and the [[Colombia national football team|Colombia national team]].

Ospina began his career at [[Atlético Nacional]], making his debut with the club in 2005. After achieving two domestic titles with ''Los Verdolagas'', Ospina joined French side [[OGC Nice|Nice]]. In 2014, he joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a four-year deal.

Ospina has been representing his country at a full international level since 2007. Upon his debut against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], he became the second-youngest goalkeeper to play for Colombia. He has since earned over 90 caps for his nation and has appeared at three [[Copa América]]s and two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].

==Club career==
[[File:David Ospina.jpg|left|thumb|Ospina with Atlético Nacional in 2008]]

===Atlético Nacional===
Ospina began his professional career in [[Categoría Primera A]] club [[Atlético Nacional]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague=england-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/240/835/0/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news |title=Arsenal seal Ospina signing |website=FIFA.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808085405/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague%3Dengland-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/240/835/0/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news |archivedate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina played a total of 97 matches with the team, even being called to the national team. With the club, Ospina achieved three league titles. In mid-2008, Ospina was transferred to French club [[OGC Nice|Nice]].&lt;ref name="Ospina to Nice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina's transfer to Nice underway|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
[[File:Ospina1.JPG|thumb|right|Ospina playing for Nice]]
After three seasons at [[Atlético Nacional]], at the age of 19, he was transferred to Nice in France for an undisclosed fee, believed to be about €2&amp;nbsp;million. Ospina was reportedly signed to become the long-term replacement of [[Hugo Lloris]], who had transferred to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] for €8.5&amp;nbsp;million. However, Ospina was served as a substitute of [[Lionel Letizi]] for the first few months of his career, before breaking into the first team. [[Frédéric Antonetti]], the manager of Nice who brought Ospina to the club, said, "He has everything you need to be a top goalkeeper. He's good in the air and he's good on the ground. He has that little extra something to be a champion. Hugo Lloris was an international-standard goalkeeper; so is David."&lt;ref name="Ospina Praised by Nice boss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina will be a success|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years into his career at Nice, Ospina publicly voiced his desire to leave the club. Nice coach [[Claude Puel]] signed promising young French goalkeeper [[Joris Delle]], and announced Delle would be promoted into the first team, sharing the position with Ospina. In the summer of 2012, Turkish club [[Besiktas J.K.|Besiktas]] attempted to sign Ospina,&lt;ref name="Besiktas bid for Ospina fails"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina to Beskitas off|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/nice-call-ospina-besiktas-sale-142023974.html|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=1 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203112050/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/nice-call-ospina-besiktas-sale-142023974.html|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the move fell through.&lt;ref name="Ospina is dropped"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina filled with frustration as he is club No 2|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ospina's performances at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and his rejection of a contract extension, he was linked to many European sides.&lt;ref name="Ospina rejects contract"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina could leave for free next season after rejecting extension|url=http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2014/david-ospina-set-to-walk-away-from-les-aiglons-for-free/|publisher=Obtenir le football|accessdate= 31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being heavily linked to [[Atlético Madrid]], Puel announced that Ospina would depart the club to join English side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Ospina will join Arsenal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Puel: Ospina to Arsenal is done|url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/nice-manager-claude-puel-confirms-david-ospina-has-joined-arsenal/|publisher=101greatgoals.com|accessdate= 27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
====2014–15 season====
On 27 July 2014, Arsenal had confirmed that Ospina had signed for the club on for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £3&amp;nbsp;million, on a four-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28508854|title=David Ospina: Arsenal sign Colombia goalkeeper from Nice|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 July 2014|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the club's official [[Instagram]] account, Arsenal revealed that Ospina would wear the number 13 shirt for the club, last worn by loanee [[Emiliano Viviano]]. On 23 September 2014, Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], a 2–1 home defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1415/post/first-team/arsenal-v-southampton-match-report |title=Arsenal v. Southampton Match Report |work=Arsenal FC |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second Arsenal appearance on 1 October in their [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] group stage match at home to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], replacing [[Alexis Sánchez]] after starting goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]] had been sent off for a [[professional foul]] on [[Burak Yılmaz]]. Ospina conceded the penalty, taken by its earner, but Arsenal won 4–1, making several vital saves in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal 4–1 Galatasaray|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29362640|accessdate=1 October 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Ospina suffered a thigh injury that would keep him out effectively for the rest of the 2014 calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/arsenal/story/2102243/arsenals-david-ospina-ruled-out-for-around-three-months-with-thigh-injury|title=Arsenal's David Ospina ruled out for around three months with thigh injury|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina resumed his cup duties in a 2–0 win against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], but maintained his place for his full [[Premier League]] debut a week later, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/551394/Arsene-Wenger-Wojciech-Szczesny-team-selection|title=Arsene Wenger: Why I picked David Ospina instead of Wojciech Szczesny|date=11 January 2015|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; With first-choice goalkeeper Szczęsny punished for smoking in the dressing room after a game against Southampton, Ospina was made first choice in the league and went on to claim successive clean sheets against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He played every remaining league game until the end of the season, with the exception of [[FA Cup]] ties against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Moreover, he was also an unused substitute in Arsenal's 4–0 win in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]] against Aston Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/32563518|title=FA Cup final – FT: Arsenal 4–0 Villa|date=30 May 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ospina's performances earned him a place on the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] longlist for the [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or#FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015 campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaworld.com/off-the-ball/ospina-reacts-ballon-or/?refresh_ce-cp|title=Arsenal's Ospina reacts to Ballon d'Or selection|website=La Gazzetta dello Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=3 October 2015|last=Sylla|first=Ogo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
[[File:David Ospina, 2015-05-31.JPG|left|thumb|Ospina after winning the [[2014–15 FA Cup|FA Cup]] with Arsenal in 2015]]
During the summer transfer window period, Ospina was linked to [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] after Arsenal had signed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] goalkeeper [[Petr Čech]], which effectively demoted Ospina to second-choice keeper. However, no deal materialised, as second-choice Wojciech Szczęsny was loaned to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33672118|title=Wojciech Szczesny: Arsenal keeper joins Roma on a season-loan deal|date=29 July 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina made his first appearance of the season in a 2–1 away defeat against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|2015–16 Champions League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34160767|title=Dinamo Zagreb 2–1 Arsenal|date=16 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the team's "cup goalkeeper", he made his first domestic appearance in a 2–1 [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[London]] [[North London derby|rivals]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34265590|title=Tottenham 1–2 Arsenal|date=23 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina made another Champions League appearance, against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], where his poor performances proved costly in a 3–2 home defeat, with the keeper conceding an own goal by dropping a corner from [[Kostas Fortounis]] into his own net'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34382802|title=Arsenal 2–3 Olympiakos|date=29 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina would later be dropped from Champions League duties in place of Čech. Ospina suffered a shoulder injury during October's international break that saw him ruled out until November. He was then in contention to face [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in January, but a training injury saw Čech take his place.

====2016–17 season====
Ospina made his first start for Arsenal of the 2016–17 season in the club's opening game in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] Group-stage against French champions [[Paris Saint Germain]], producing a man-of-the-match performance as Arsenal drew 1–1; Ospina himself drew praise for many saves made during the game, mainly against striker [[Edinson Cavani]]. Ospina started in the FA cup final where he conceded 1 goal as Arsenal won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37331259|title=Paris St-Germain 1–1 Arsenal|date=13 September 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3787688/PSG-1-1-Arsenal-Alexis-Sanchez-rescues-Champions-League-point-Gunners.html|title=PSG 1–1 Arsenal: Alexis Sanchez rescues Champions League point|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2403638.html|title=Ospina keen to seize chance after Arsenal heroics|first=|last=UEFA.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
Ospina made his first appearance of the season in a 1–0 win over [[Doncaster Rovers]] in the [[Carabao Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249728|title=Arsenal 1–0 Doncaster|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second start in a 3–1 [[Europa League]] win against [[FC Cologne]], committing an error that led to the team going 1–0 down early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41227374|title=Arsenal 3–1 FC Cologne|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Arsenal suffered four straight defeats Ospina kept a clean sheet as the Gunners beat [[AC Milan]] 2–0 at the [[San Siro Stadium]] in the Europa League round of 16 on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43321163|title=AC Milan 0–2 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoli (loan)===
Following the arrival of [[Bernd Leno]], Ospina requested go on loan in order to gain proper playing time. On August 15, Serie A team [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] agreed to a one-year loan deal with an option to buy following new signing [[Alex Meret]]'s injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/15/david-ospina-joins-napoli-on-loan-from-arsenal |title=

==International career==
[[File:FWC 2018 - Round of 16 - COL v ENG - Photo 088.jpg|right|thumb|Ospina during the Round of 16 penalty shoot-out against England]]
Ospina had his first international experience representing Colombia's [[Colombia national under-20 football team|under-20 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://es.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=9102/teams/team=44021.html |date=* |title=2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup&amp;nbsp;– Colombia squad }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina was called up for the first time in the national U-20 team for [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. At only 16 years old, Ospina was the youngest member of the squad, however he did not play any game during the whole tournament. Ospina was called back for the [[2007 South American U-20 Championship]], where he played four games. However, Colombia failed to qualify for the World Cup, the last youth tournament he had the opportunity to play in.

Ospina made his debut for the senior team as a substitute in the 1–3 defeat against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He played his first match in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], becoming the second-youngest goalkeeper to play for the Colombian national team.

Ospina was selected as the main goalkeeper for Colombia throughout the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] competition. At the end of the qualifiers, Ospina conceded the fewest number of goals of the tournament.

At the [[2014 World Cup]], Ospina appeared in all of Colombia's matches and conceded four goals throughout the tournament.

In May 2018 he was named in Colombia’s preliminary 35 man [[Colombia national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb&lt;/ref&gt; Despite saving a penalty against [[Jordan Henderson]] in the Round of 16 penalty shoot-out against [[England national football team|England]], Colombia were eliminated 3–4 on penalties.

==Personal life==
Ospina was brother-in-law to fellow Colombian international footballer [[James Rodríguez]], who married David's sister Daniela in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fabwags.com/?p=26880 |title=James Rodriguez The Soccer Star is also a Family Man |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they announced their separation in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/james-rod/1mugl77wy9d541exdz6rcd0eqt|title=James Rodriguez and wife Daniela Ospina announce separation |website=Goal.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina is married to Colombian model Jesica Sterling, whom he married in 2012, and has one daughter named Dulce María            &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fabwags.com/jesica-sterling-colombian-soccer-player-david-ospinas-wife/|work= Fabwags|date=9 September 2014 |title=Jesica Sterling – Colombian Soccer player David Ospina's Wife|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son named Maximiliano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/es-co/news/4604/colombianos-en-inglaterra/2015/01/26/8340492/david-ospina-es-padre-por-segunda-vez |title=David Ospina es padre por segunda vez |language=Spanish |date=26 January 2015 |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arsenal ===
{{wikinews|Arsenal signs Japanese Takuma; Chelsea signs Batshuayi}}
On 3 July 2016, Asano was announced as [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s second signing of the season, subject to a medical and international clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/10332294/arsenal-to-sign-takuma-asano-from-japans-sanfrecce-hiroshima|title=Arsenal to sign Takuma Asano from Japan's Sanfrecce Hiroshima|last=Charles|first=Andy|date=3 July 2016|website=|publisher=Sky Sports|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Arsène Wenger|Arsene Wenger]] described him as "a talented young striker and very much one for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/03/arsenal-sign-takuma-asano-j-league-football-transfer-window|title=Arsenal sign Japanese striker Takuma Asano from Sanfrecce Hiroshima|date=3 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Asano was refused a work permit to play in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20160826/asano-loaned-to-stuttgart-|title=Asano loaned to Stuttgart|publisher=Arsenal FC|date=26 August 2016|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loan to Hannover 96 ====
On 23 May 2018, Asano was loaned out again to another [[Bundesliga]] team for the season, [[Hannover 96]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Asano to join Hannover 96 on loan|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/asano-join-hannover-96-loan|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|date=23 May 2018|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
On 7 May 2015, [[Japan national football team|Japan]]'s coach [[Vahid Halilhodžić]] called him for a two-days training camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikkansports.com/soccer/japan/news/1473077.html 大久保嘉人ら28人日本代表候補合宿メンバー／一覧]. Nikkansports.com (7 May 2015). Retrieved on 2016-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2015, he was called again for the upcoming [[2015 EAFF East Asian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfa.jp/national_team/news/00006836/ EAFF東アジアカップ2015（8/2～9＠中国／武漢） SAMURAI BLUE（日本代表）メンバー・スケジュール]. Japan Football Association (23 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Asano scored his first goal on 3 June 2016 in the [[Kirin Cup#Kirin Cup Soccer 2016|2016 Kirin Cup]]  in a 7–2 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportal.co.nz/football/news/japan-7-bulgaria-2-kagawa-at-the-double-in-dominant-win-kirin-cup/q3w5c00habi19c97609wx163|title=Japan 7 Bulgaria 2: Kagawa at the double in dominant win|date=3 June 2016|website=Sportal|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asano represented the [[Japan national under-23 football team|under-23 side]] at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], where Japan was eliminated in the group stage.

On 15 March 2018, [[Vahid Halilhodzic]] surprisingly left out Asano and [[Yosuke Ideguchi]] for the [[Japan national football team|Japan]] squad for friendly matches with [[Mali national football team|Mali]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in preparation for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], with Halilhodzic describing Asano &amp; Ideguchi's lack of regular game time, he proclaimed ''It makes me sad that Asano and Ideguchi are not playing, They were the heroes of our qualifying game against [[Australia national football team|Australia]]. They haven’t been chosen this time, and if things continue the way they are, there is a chance that they won’t be chosen for the World Cup.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Halilhodzic reveals roster for upcoming friendlies|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/03/15/soccer/halilhodzic-reveals-roster-upcoming-friendlies/#.WqqLBOjFLIU |newspaper=Japan TImes|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 he was named in Japan’s preliminary [[Japan national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: All the confirmed squads for this summer's finals in Russia|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/440833652018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not make the final 23.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goal.com/en/amp/news/kento-misao-yosuke-ideguchi-takuma-asano-cut-japan-world-cup/1vx0o2pxmil9h1s2hb9k4emkec&lt;/ref&gt;
