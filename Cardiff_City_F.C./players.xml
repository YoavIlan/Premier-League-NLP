'''Neil Leonard Dula Etheridge''' (born 7 February 1990) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|CardiffC}} club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines national team]]. He joined the [[Fulham F.C. Academy|Fulham Academy]] after three years as a trainee at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and made his debut for Fulham in [[UEFA Europa League]] against Danish club [[Odense Boldklub]], though he never played in a league match with the club. While with Fulham from 2006 until 2014 he was loaned to various lower tier clubs; [[Leatherhead F.C.|Leatherhead]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].

After leaving Fulham, Etheridge signed with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] before he was loaned to Charlton Athletic. He joined Charlton on a permanent basis in 2015 after his contract with Oldham ended. After months of being without a club, Etheridge joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] making more than 90 appearances in all competitions in two seasons before moving to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club Cardiff City in 2017. 

After establishing himself as first choice goalkeeper, he helped the Welsh side win promotion to the Premier League and became the first Filipino player to play in the Premier League in August 2018. A former [[England national under-16 football team|England Schoolboys]] international, he now represents the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] at senior international level.

==Early life==
Etheridge was born in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], London to Englishman Martin Etheridge and Filipina Merlinda Dula, a native of [[Tarlac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/manila-times/20110110/281775625601086 |title=Etheridge: A man with vision for Philippine football |publisher=Philippine Index |author=Noguera, Emil C. |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |via=The Press Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer1&gt;{{cite news |first=Cedelf P. |last=Tupas |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080513-136168/Etheridges-goal-in-between-posts |title=Etheridge's goal in between posts |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006181430/http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080513-136168/Etheridges-goal-in-between-posts |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up football at the age of nine,&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt; initially playing as a left midfielder or striker before switching to playing as a goalkeeper in 2000 after volunteering to switch due to an injury to his youth side's regular goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="XI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/september/05/fulham-first-xi |title=Fulham first XI |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Court Moor School]] in [[Fleet, Hampshire]], where he also represented Hampshire Schools and the Aldershot &amp; Farnborough district teams.&lt;ref name=gethampshire1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/sport/other-sport/keeper-gets-england-call-5364885 |title=Keeper gets England call |work=Get Hampshire |date=11 October 2005 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216044124/http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/sport/other-sport/keeper-gets-england-call-5364885 |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Chelsea Academy===
Having played for local youth sides Cuffy Chiefs and Hart Boys,&lt;ref name="XI"/&gt; Etheridge began attending the [[Chelsea F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Chelsea Academy]] in 2003 at under-14 level,&lt;ref name=gethampshire1/&gt; where he was also teammates with eventual Philippine internationals [[James Younghusband|James]] and [[Phil Younghusband]]. He started out as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but eventually switched to playing as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at the suggestion of his coach.&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt;

===Fulham===
[[File:Neil Etheridge.jpg|thumb|upright|Etheridge training with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 2010]]

In 2006, he moved to local rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and signed professional terms for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fleethants.com/allfleethants/news/news2006.htm |title=20 July&amp;nbsp;– Dream Come True |work=Fleet Hampshire News |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etheridge signed for [[Isthmian League]] Division One South club [[Leatherhead F.C.|Leatherhead]] in September 2008 on loan for the entire 2008–09 season and made his debut on 20 September in the 2–1 home defeat to [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-round-up-september-20-4827360 |title=Football round-up, September 20 |work=Get Surrey |author=Blackledge, Sam |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his loan spell, he received the first red card of his career, being sent off for dissent during a 2–1 defeat to [[Sittingbourne F.C.|Sittingbourne]] in a preliminary round of the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name="XI"/&gt;

In September 2009, Etheridge underwent surgery on both knees after suffering from [[tendinitis]]. He was expected to be out for the entire [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]] but returned in January 2010, eventually making nine appearances for the reserves. By the end of the season he signed a new one-year deal, keeping him at Fulham until the summer of 2011, attributing his contract extension to his quick recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Cedelf P. |last=Tupas |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/sportsevents/sportsevents/view/20100625-277407/Fulham-FC-signs-goalie-Etheridge-to-extension |title=Fulham FC signs goalie Etheridge to extension |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702072759/http://sports.inquirer.net/sportsevents/sportsevents/view/20100625-277407/Fulham-FC-signs-goalie-Etheridge-to-extension |archivedate=2 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Etheridge received his first senior team call-up on 11 September 2010, when he was named on the substitute bench as cover for [[Mark Schwarzer]] in a home game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] due to an injury to regular second choice goalkeeper [[David Stockdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8977069.stm |title=Fulham v Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Etheridge joined [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on loan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/9418465.stm |title=Addicks sign young Fulham keeper Neil Etheridge |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was recalled six days later without playing for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/9426491.stm |title=Keeper Neil Etheridge recalled from Charlton by Fulham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etheridge signed a new contract in May that would extend his stay at [[Craven Cottage]] until the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/may/10/etheridge-contract-extension |title=Etheridge contract extension |publisher=Fulham F.C |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first senior appearance for Fulham against [[Odense Boldklub]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|2011–12]] [[UEFA Europa League]] on 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/match-centre/2011_2012/europa-league/group-k/home/odense-boldklub |title=Fulham 2–2 Odense BK |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 2012 upon his return to Fulham after completing his international duties, it was announced that Etheridge would be out for the rest of the season due to a wrist injury that was sustained in the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]]. He recovered quickly and on 9 May he has been able to play in the development squad's last game of the season against the reserves of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/may/29/summer-action |title=Summer action |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on an initial one-month loan on 20 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/september/20/etheridge-loan |title=Etheridge loan deal |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first [[English Football League|Football League]] appearance for Rovers against [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] on 22 September,  which was his and Rovers' first clean sheet of [[2012–13 Bristol Rovers F.C. season|2012–13 season]].&lt;ref name=sb1213/&gt; His arrival at the club coincided with an improvement in the club's form, leading to his loan deal being extended until December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/october/23/etheridge-extends-loan |title=Etheridge extends loan |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, Fulham confirmed that Etheridge had been recalled from his loan at Bristol Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/november/21/etheridge-recalled |title=Etheridge Recalled |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge signed a one-year extension to his Fulham contract on 8 May 2013, with the option of a further year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/may/08/etheridges-extension |title=Etheridge's Extension |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2013, he joined League One club [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on loan until 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/november/22/etheridge-joins-crewe |title=Etheridge Joins Crewe |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined the club once again on 25 February 2014 on loan until 13 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/february/25/etheridge-rejoins-crewe |title=Etheridge rejoins Crewe |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=25 February 2014 |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was recalled on 4 April by Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/april/04/etheridge-recalled |title=Etheridge Recalled |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[2013–14 in English football|2013–14 season]], he was released by Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier League clubs submit retained and released lists |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504185633/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |archivedate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oldham Athletic and return to Charlton Athletic===
Following his release from Fulham, Etheridge used his own money to train with Charlton, one of his former loan clubs, where he knew the goalkeeping coach.

==International career==

===England youth===
Etheridge is a former [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16]] international, having played in the 2005 [[Victory Shield]],&lt;ref name=gethampshire1/&gt; in which England and Wales eventually shared the trophy. Despite having represented England at youth level, he remained eligible to represent the Philippines through his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/march/09/through-the-ranks |title=Through the ranks |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
====Early years====
In 2007, Etheridge received an invitation to play for the Philippines but declined the offer, citing unfamiliarity with the language and the players.&lt;ref name=headseast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2008/april/10/etheridge-heads-east |title=Etheridge heads east |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again invited in early 2008, this time by the new [[Philippine Football Federation]] president [[Jose Mari Martinez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2008_April_29/4-fil-british-players-join/ai_n35373233/?tag=content;col1 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717221021/http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2008_April_29/4-fil-british-players-join/ai_n35373233/?tag=content;col1 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |title=4 Fil-British players join football team |format=reprint |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |publisher=Find Articles |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually accepted the invitation after speaking to the new manager and learning about the set up,&lt;ref name=headseast/&gt; and after encouragement from Chelsea youth teammate Phil Younghusband.&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt; He officially switched allegiance to the Philippines in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2008/october/09/international-action |title=International action |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full international debut against [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] in the [[2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualification|2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers]],&lt;ref name="Manila"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19741354 |title=Neil Etheridge's journey from Manila to the Memorial Stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Christine |last=Chapman |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing in all three of his country's matches. He kept three clean sheets but the Philippines still failed to qualify due to an inferior [[goal difference]] to group winners [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/challenge-cup-previous-competitions/afc-challenge-cup-2008/19225 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203142226/http://www.the-afc.com/en/challenge-cup-previous-competitions/afc-challenge-cup-2008/19225 |archivedate=3 February 2013 |title=Tajikistan sail through |publisher=Asian Football Confederation |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 onward====
In 2010, Etheridge was named in the Philippines' squad for the [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]]. The Philippines came in second in their group, with one win and two draws, and conceding only one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218230526/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_740267/Myanmar_0_Philippines_1_-_Filipinos_through_to_last_four |title=Myanmar 0 Philippines 0 – Filipinos through to last four |publisher=AFF Suzuki Cup |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But both legs of the semi-finals ended in 1–0 defeats for the Philippines against [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221113117/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_749660/Indonesia_1_Philippines_0_-_Gonzales_fires_Indonesia_into_final |title=Indonesia 1 Philippines 0 – Gonzales fires Indonesia into final |publisher=AFF Suzuki Cup |date=19 December 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then called up for his country for the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification|AFC Challenge Cup Qualifiers]] where he conceded only a single goal, enabling the Philippines to qualify for the group stage. Etheridge announced his interest to join the squad for the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]] but was originally in doubt to be included due to club commitments. However, after receiving clearance from Fulham to travel, he was included in the final 23-man squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/38217/out-of-it-all-neil-etheridge-stays-with-team |title=Out of it all, Neil Etheridge stays with team |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |last=Tupas |first=Cedelf |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2012 against [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]], he saved a penalty taken by [[Pak Song-chol (footballer, born 1991)|Pak Song-chol]] in the 16th minute as the match ended 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/37197/spirited-azkals-yield-by-just-2-to-north-koreans |title=Spirited Azkals yield by just 2 to North Koreans |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author=Tupas, Cedelf |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[sent off]] in the closing minutes of the semi-final match against [[Turkmenistan national football team|Turkmenistan]], which the Philippines lost 2–1.

[[File:Neil e gk.jpg|thumb|upright|Etheridge during a match against Singapore]]

In August 2014, Etheridge was not included in the training squad for the 2014 Peace Cup, which also serves as the country's preliminary squad for the [[2014 AFF Championship|2014 AFF Suzuki Cup]], due to a lack of first team club football. He labelled manager [[Thomas Dooley]] "disrespectful" over the omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/football/azkals-coach-thomas-dooley-also-criticizes-neil-etheridge |title=Azkals coach Dooley answers Neil Etheridge 'disrespectful' rant over Peace Cup snub |website=spin.ph |last=Sacamos |first=Karlo |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, it was announced that Etheridge would not be included in the [[2016 AFF Championship]] squad, because of club commitments with Walsall.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
Peltier joined the [[Liverpool F.C.

On 16 March 2007, Peltier was subject to an emergency loan cover agreement, and subsequently joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until the end of the season in order to gain first team experience.&lt;ref name="Hull bring in Liverpool youngster"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hull bring in Liverpool youngster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/6458181.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 March 2007|accessdate=16 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/2408564/tigers-pick-up-peltier |title=Tigers pick up Peltier |publisher=Sky Sports News |last=O'Rourke |first=Peter |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 4–0 victory against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and went on to make seven appearances for the club in the final two months of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]].&lt;ref name=sb0607/&gt;

In order to gain further first team opportunities, manager [[Rafael Benítez]] loaned Peltier to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 31 July 2007 until 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter|last=O'Rourke|title=Yeovil land Reds starlet|url=http://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11669/2632412/yeovil-land-reds-starlet|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/1929987.time-is-ticking-for-yeovil-town/ |title=Time is ticking for Yeovil Town |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=28 December 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier agreed to join the club following encouragement from his mother.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Eleven days later, he made his debut in a 1–0 defeat against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt; Although a right-back, Peltier played as a [[midfielder]] during an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in November, but switched back to his original position against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] after one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lee Peltier, Yeovil Town Steve Claridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/20/yeovil|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Claridge|first=Steve|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 21 appearances in all competitions during his loan spell without scoring.&lt;ref name="sb0708"/&gt;

On 21 January 2008, he joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on trial, featuring in a reserve team fixture against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], but was not offered a contract by manager [[Glenn Roeder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/peltier.htm |title=Lee Peltier |publisher=Flown From The Nest |last=Whitlam |first=Steve |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2008, he returned to Yeovil on a permanent basis for a small fee, signing a  three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/2010550.liverpool-youngster-returns-to-yeovil-town/ |title=Liverpool youngster returns to Yeovil Town |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season having made 38 appearances in all competitions, including his original loan spell, and won the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt;&lt;ref name="yeovilaward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/2237031.peltier-is-yeovil-towns-young-gun/ |title=Peltier is Yeovil Town's young gun! |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season with Yeovil, Peltier made 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring his only goal for the club in a 3–2 victory over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on 20 December 2008.&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt; His performances attracted attention from several clubs and Yeovil assistant manager [[Nathan Jones (Welsh footballer)|Nathan Jones]] confirmed that the club would not "stand in his way [...] if the price was right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/4448847.peltier-could-leave-yeovil-town-if-the-price-is-right/ |title=Peltier could leave Yeovil Town if the "price is right" |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his positive performancea, Peltier later admitted to suffering from homesickness during his spell with Yeovil having moved away from Liverpool for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/huddersfield-towns-peltier-life-yeovil-5006541.amp |title=Huddersfield Town's Peltier on life at Yeovil Town |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting "I was quite happy with my football but [...] I struggled a bit and got quite homesick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/huddersfield-town-lee-peltier-interview-1-2237295 |title=Huddersfield Town: Lee Peltier interview |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of Huddersfield's League One playoff defeat, the club received enquiries for several players including Peltier. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/alex-smithies-lee-peltier-could-4973104 |title=Alex Smithies and Lee Peltier could be set to leave Huddersfield Town |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much speculation regarding Peltier's position lf captain, despite captaining Leeds during 2013–14 pre-season and for the opening two games of the season, Peltier was replaced in the role by teammate [[Rodolph Austin]] who returned to the side against Leicester City on 11 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/w3yls943av5x1s4p0c6p3eyxk/title/leicester-live!|title=Leicester Vs Leeds|publisher=Leeds United F.C.|date=11 August 2013|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier publicly supported Austin following the announcement, commenting "It was the gaffer’s choice to go with Rudy and I respect that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-axed-captain-peltier-says-he-s-buzzing-for-pal-austin-1-6049850 |title=Axed captain Peltiers says he’s ‘buzzing’ for pal Austin |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier scored his first Leeds goal in a 1–1 draw against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 26 December 2013 with a looping header.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The following season, Peltier became an ever-present member of the team which had just missed out on a play-off place on the final day against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheffield Wednesday 3–0 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36118083 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2016 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of [[Paul Trollope]] in 2016 as Slade's successor threatened to displace Peltier from the side with the new manager favouring more attack minded full-back [[Jazz Richards]]. However, Trollope was sacked after three months in charge and was replaced by Peltier's former Leeds manager Neil Warnock.&lt;ref name="unsung"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Johnson|title=Cardiff City's unsung hero – Why Lee Peltier has rediscovered himself under Neil Warnock|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-unsung-hero-lee-12171473.amp|work=WalesOnline|publisher=Media Wales|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Peltier underwent an operation on his ankle, which resulted in a long-term absence from the first-team squad. He eventually made his return on 17 April, having missed nearly three months, against Nottingham Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City defender Lee Peltier has operation on ankle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38931420 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an injury-ridden season, he made 28 appearances and was rewarded with a two-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City: Bluebirds contract extensions for Hoilett and Peltier |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40174267 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peltier was part of the side that won promotion to the Premier League during the 2017–18 season, making 30 appearances for the club as they finished as Championship runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44993945 |title=Lee Peltier: Cardiff City defender discharged after head blow |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Phillips |first=Rob |date=29 July 2018 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening match of the following season, he made his Premier League debut in a 2–0 defeat to AFC Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45067370 |title=Bournemouth 2–0 Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=11 August 2018 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped from the first team following the match with manager Neil Warnock favouring playing centre-back [[Bruno Ecuele Manga]] at right-back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-newcastle-united-bournemouth-15049487 |title=A ruthless Cardiff City selection decision, a surprise stat and the men forced into the shadows |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |last=Mitchelmore |first=Ian |date=20 August 2018 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; not making a league appearance for over a month when he suffered a shoulder injury during a 5–0 defeat to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45614525 |title=Cardiff City 0–5 Manchester City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2018 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Peltier is a former youth international player having represented his native England at international level. He was capped at under-18 level three times during his time as a player at hometown club Liverpool but has not been capped at a higher level than under-18s to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Huddersfield-pound-1m-price-tag-Leicester-City/story-12789820-detail/story.html|title=Huddersfield put £1m price-tag on Leicester City target Lee Peltier|date=17 June 2011|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=Leicester Mercury |archiveurl=https://archive.is/2nYuc |archivedate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Peltier was approached by the [[Antigua and Barbuda Football Association]] to represent the [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|Benna Boys]] at international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baptitste|first=Neto|title=Help for Benna Boys|url=http://www.antiguaobserver.com/?p=79817|publisher=Antigua Observer|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Though mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]], Peltier also plays in the centre-back position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doug|last=Thomson|title=Huddersfield Town ready to step up bid to bring Lee Peltier back after defender leaves Leeds United|url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/huddersfield-town-ready-step-up-7310804.amp|newspaper=Huddersfield Daily Examiner|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that right-back is his favourite position and has described himself as "a hard working defensive type of player who likes to tackle and pass the ball. I get about the pitch quite well and keep it simple."&lt;ref name="pink"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doug|last=Thomson|title=Nothing new about midfield role for Huddersfield Town’s Lee Peltier|url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/news/nothing-new-midfield-role-huddersfield-4981184.amp|newspaper=Huddersfield Daily Examiner|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not move up the flanks and shoot crosses; instead he only plays as a defender. Scott Johnson from ''[[Media Wales#Wales Online|WalesOnline]]'' wrote that he "does not fit the modern stereotype of what we now expect from a full-back, as he is not particularly swashbuckling or flashy."&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 2009, Peltier was shopping with fellow footballer [[Victor Anichebe]] in [[Knutsford]] when the pair were stopped by police officers after being accused of theft. During the incident, Peltier was handcuffed by officers and Anichebe's crutch was confiscated. The pair were not arrested over the claim and Anichebe received a public apology from the assistant chief constable of the [[Cheshire Constabulary]] over the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/cheshire-police-apologises-everton-fc-3457189 |title=Cheshire police apologises to Everton FC star Victor Anichebe over Knutsford incident |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier is close friends with fellow footballer [[James Vaughan (footballer, born 1988)|James Vaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/huddersfield-towns-lee-peltier-no-7342880 |title=Huddersfield Town's Lee Peltier has no worries about settling back in |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starting the season as a regular in the first team, Richards suffered a training injury in September that led to him missing three months of the season.

He eventually made his return on 2 January, as unused substitute against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff boss Warnock disappointed at speed of Richards return |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38410649 |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Michael Pearlman |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 1–0 Aston Villa |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38433120 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2017 |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed an extended run in the first team soon after, playing in ten of the club's following twelve matches, stating that he felt that he had "a lot more to show.

'''Harry Nicholas Arter''' (born 28 December 1989) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on loan from [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]], and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

He began his career at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], progressing through the club's youth academy before making his professional debut in 2007. He was loaned to [[Non-League football|non-league]] sides [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] and [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]] before being released, subsequently joining [[Woking F.C.|Woking]]. After one season at Woking, he returned to [[The Football League]] with Bournemouth, becoming a first team regular following a loan to [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in 2011. He contributed to Bournemouth's promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2013, and to the [[Premier League]] two years later.

Born and raised in England, Arter represents the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] internationally. He played for the nation at [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] level, and made his senior debut in June 2015.

==Early life==
Born in [[Sidcup]], in the London borough of [[Bexley]], to parents Terry and Linda Arter,&lt;ref name="show"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8316166.cherries-arter-keen-to-show-addicks-what-theyre-missing/ |title=Arter keen to show Addicks what they're missing |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was raised in the nearby area of [[Eltham]].&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11543759.AFC_Bournemouth__Charlton_exit_hurt_midfielder_Arter/ |title=AFC Bournemouth: Charlton exit hurt midfielder Harry Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three brothers, Benji, Daniel and Paddy and a sister, Carly.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Charlton Athletic===
He began his career with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Glenda|editor1-last=Rollin|editor2-first=Jack|editor2-last=Rollin|title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2012–2013|year=2012|publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group|Headline]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7553-6356-8|page=434|edition=43rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the club's youth system at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Turning down offers from other clubs to remain with Charlton,&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; he made his professional debut, and only appearance for the club, on 25 September 2007 in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], away to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He came on as an 86th-minute substitute for [[Svetoslav Todorov]] as Charlton lost 3–1 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luton 3–1 Charlton (aet)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008011.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was diagnosed with chronic [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]] in his [[Achilles tendon|achilles]] which eventually ruptured, leading to almost a year out of action.&lt;ref name="stuck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the42.ie/harry-arter-ireland-poland-2011405-Mar2015/ |title=Five years ago, Harry Arter was stuck in the Conference. Now he's eyeing up an Ireland debut |website=the42.ie |last=Kelly |first=Niall |date=25 March 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to fitness, he struggled to break into the first team under new manager [[Phil Parkinson]].&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arter immediately clashed with Parkinson, accusing the manager of "belittling" him by sending him for a trial with non-league side [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] prior to a short loan spell.&lt;ref name="balls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/harry-arter-3-356581 |title=Harry Arter Explains How He Ended Up Playing Non-League Football |website=balls.ie |last=Browne |first=PJ |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later had a loan spell with [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]] as Charlton suffered relegation to [[EFL League One|League One]] and Arter was subsequently released by Parkinson as part of an effort to reduce costs at the club. Arter later expressed his disappointment with the decision, stating "The money I was asking for [...] was nothing. I would have taken anything to stay at the time, so it wasn’t down to finance, it was him (Parkinson) not liking me as a footballer."&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Despite his release, he was allowed to train with Charlton's youth team by coach Steve Avory who had worked with Arter for several years in his youth career.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter later undertook unsuccessful trials with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and even offered to remain with Charlton without pay but was rejected by Parkinson.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt;

===Woking===
On 2 June 2009, Arter joined [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] on a one-year contract along with his former Charlton teammate [[Aswad Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=David|title=New Players|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1487/new-players/|publisher=[[Woking F.C.]]|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-boardman-happy-kingfield-return-4823711 |title=Boardman happy with Kingfield return |publisher=Surrey Live |last=Youlton |first=Clive |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being recommended by assistant manager [[Jimmy Dack]] who had worked with Arter previously at Welling.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter had been waiting for a firm offer to join [[AFC Wimbledon]] but accepted Woking's offer after Wimbledon failed to call back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11697518.AFC_Bournemouth_feature__Harry_Arter_s_rise_from_Conference_South_to_the_top_of_the_Championship/ |title=Harry Arter's rise from Conference South to the top of the Championship |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in the opening day of the 2009–10 season, during a 2–1 victory over his former side Welling United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1566/woking-finish-strongly-for-an-opening-win/ |title=Woking finish strongly for an opening win |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2009, Arter scored a [[hat-trick]] for the club during a 5–0 win over [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1724/hat-trick-harry-/ |title=Hat-trick Harry |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2009–10 season, it was well documented that Arter would be leaving Woking, with several [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs chasing Arter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Arter to remain at Woking despite interest|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8459616.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arter_Bournemouth"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sole, Arter and Sinclair leave Woking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8692865.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woking's website soon confirmed that Arter had agreed to sign for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] with the fee to be decided by an [[The FA|FA]] tribunal, as the two clubs could not agree a transfer fee,&lt;ref name="Arter_Bournemouth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=John|title=Player News|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/2149/player-news/|publisher=Woking F.C.|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Woking hoping to receive around £30,000 for the move after rejecting Bournemouth's initial £2,000 offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15658859.when-i-said-harry-arter-would-reach-the-top-they-looked-at-me-as-if-i-was-an-idiot/ |title=When I said Harry Arter would reach the top, they looked at me as if I was an idiot |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=13 November 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter later described how he had planned to give up football if his season with Woking had failed.&lt;ref name="artful"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/harry-arter-interview-artful-arter-two-wins-from-the-dream-10202511.html |title=Harry Arter interview: Artful Arter two wins from the dream |newspaper=The Independent |last=Pitt-Brooke |first=Jack |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
====2010–11====
On 7 June 2010, Arter joined [[Football League One|League One]] club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, later stated as £4,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14899272.AFC_Bournemouth__We_knew_Harry_Arter_was_worth_more_than___4_000_-_we_thought_he_was_worth_closer_to___10_000_/ |title=We knew Harry Arter was worth more than £4,000 - we thought he was worth closer to £10,000! |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Eddie Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfers – June 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8714557.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=League One guide: Bournemouth – Charlton Athletic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8835277.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had moved to sign Arter after impressing assistant manager [[Jason Tindall]] during a scouting assignment,&lt;ref name="artful"/&gt; with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14586002.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-demanding-year-for-ultimate-professional-harry/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: Demanding year for ultimate professional Harry |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, after impressing during the club's preseason fixtures,&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8332113.cherries-arter-aims-to-put-charlton-disappointment-behind-him/ |title=Arter aims to put Charlton disappointment behind him |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made his debut in their first match of the season, away to his former team Charlton. He was [[Penalty card|booked]] in the first half for a foul on [[Akpo Sodje]] and substituted at half time for [[Michael Symes]] as Bournemouth lost 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlton 1 – 0 Bournemouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8842030.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently dropped from the first team,&lt;ref name="aims"/&gt; not making another start in the league for Bournemouth until November,&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2010/2011"/&gt; having also been hampered by a [[hernia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8396745.cherries-harry-will-play-on-but-faces-surgery/ |title=Harry will play on, but faces surgery |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hernia eventually required surgery, resulting in Arter being ruled out for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8476568.cherries-arter-back-with-a-bang-after-october-nightmare/ |title=Arter back with a bang after October nightmare |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having fallen out of favour under new manager [[Lee Bradbury]], despite being handed a new three-year contract following his appointment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8849262.cherries-bradburys-belief-in-moles-and-arter/ |title=Bradbury's belief in Moles and Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=12  February 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 March 2011, Arter went on a one-month loan to fellow League One team [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in order to gain first team experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carlisle Utd: Harry Arter Joins on Loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/9415686.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he made his debut for the club, replacing [[Liam Noble]] for the last 30 minutes away to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. He scored an extra-time equaliser, the first of his professional career, but a minute later [[Liam Bridcutt]] scored Brighton's winner in a 4–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brighton 4 – 3 Carlisle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9407629.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four further appearances for the club during his loan spell before returning to Bournemouth.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2010/2011"/&gt;

The sales of [[Danny Hollands]] and [[Anton Robinson]] during the 2011 summer transfer window allowed Arter to gain increased first team experience with Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9181634.cherries-star-arters-pledge-i-can-fill-the-midfield-void/ |title=Cherries star Arter's pledge: I can fill the midfield void|newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2011, Arter replaced [[Mark Molesley]] in the 66th minute of a game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Dean Court]], and 17 minutes later confirmed a 2–0 win with his first goal for the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cherries stroll to first win|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/238821/report|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=Sky Sports|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to score in his two following appearances, a 3–1 defeat to [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] and a 2–1 victory over his former side Carlisle.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt; His performances attracted the attention of several Championship clubs and Bournemouth rejected enquiries from two clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9283535.cherries-arter-focused-only-on-lees-side/ |title=Arter focused only on Lee's side |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before handing him an improved contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9279965.cherries-club-staves-off-championship-interest-in-arter/ |title=Club staves off Championship interest in Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite an upturn in form, Arter suffered from a poor disciplinary record, serving a one-match suspension after collecting five bookings within the first two months of the season and accumulating nine bookings by November. His tally was the worst in League One and led him to seek advice from a sports psychologist in order to control his anger, with the majority of his bookings being due to dissent towards match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9371262.cherries-hot-headed-harry-vows-to-clean-up-act/ |title=Hot-headed Harry vows to clean up act |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually received a two-match ban for receiving his tenth booking of the season a month later and a further three-match ban later in the season for his fifteenth booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9419992.cherries-banned-harry-wary-of-losing-place-in-team/ |title=Banned Harry wary of losing place in team |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9894619.cherries-arter-issues-apology-to-supporters/ |title=Arter issues apology to supporters |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bradbury was dismissed and replaced by former youth team manager [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]], Arter stated that he hoped to be used in a more attacking role after claiming that Bradbury had played him "too defensively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9768112.cherries-arter-relishing-new-attacking-role-after-defensive-claim-over-bradbury/ |title=Arter relishing new attacking role after 'defensive' claim over Bradbury |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he scored 5 goals in 34 league matches during the season as Bournemouth finished in 11th place.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt;

====2012–13====

On 25 August 2012, in his fourth appearance of the 2012–13 season Arter was sent off after 26 minutes of Bournemouth's 1–1 draw at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for two bookable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preston 1–1 Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19304261|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the dismissal, he issued a public apology for the sending off and blamed his "immaturity."&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt; Manager Groves held talks with Arter in an attempt to curb his disciplinary problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9908086.cherries-groves-wants-harry-to-rise-above-red-mist/ |title=Groves wants Harry to rise above red mist |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite accepting his behaviour, Arter also claimed that he was being unfairly treated by referees due to his reputation, commenting "I feel I am being highlighted before a game. [...] I have earned that reputation so it is my fault. But, in another way, it is unfair on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10069667.cherries-arter-claims-he-is-a-target-for-referees/ |title=Arter claims he is a target for referees |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2012, in Eddie Howe's first match back in charge following his reappointment as manager, Arter scored in a 3–1 home win over [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bournemouth 3–1 Tranmere|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19939697|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Howe's first decisions on his return was to sign Arter to an extended contract, set to run until 2015 with Bournemouth retaining the option for a further year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10011319.cherries-manager-howe-this-is-the-ideal-club-for-arter/ |title=Cherries manager Howe: This is the ideal club for Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Howe's return, Arter became a key figure in the side as the club embarked on a fifteen match unbeaten run that moved them into promotion contention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10172636.cherries-arter-focused-despite-speculation/ |title=Arter focused despite speculation |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually losing 1–0 to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10173423.Cherries__Unbeaten_run_bites_the_dust_as_Walsall_claim_victory/ |title=Unbeaten run bites the dust as Walsall claim victory |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving a two-match ban for accumulating ten bookings for the second consecutive season, manager Howe praised Arter and stated his belief that he had "matured" as a player and his bookings were largely due to his combative nature on the field rather than dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10260053.cherries-combative-arter-has-matured-says-howe/ |title='Combative' Arter has matured says Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, he scored 8 goals in 37 league matches, including in a 3–1 win in the penultimate game of the season against Carlisle on 20 April 2013, which secured Bournemouth promotion to the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchener|first1=Mark|title=Bournemouth 3–1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133176|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter described his goal as "the most important goal I have ever scored and one that will probably stick with me for the rest of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10369987.cherries-goal-hero-harry-proud-of-promotion-triumph/ |title=Goal hero Harry proud of promotion triumph | newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship, they began their campaign against Arter's former side Charlton for the third time in four seasons,&lt;ref name="jinx"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10590400.cherries-arter-keen-to-break-charlton-jinx/ |title=Arter keen to break Charlton jinx |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=3 August 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning 2–1 on the opening day of the season as Arter recorded a victory over his former side for the first time in his career.&lt;ref name="jinx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2013/2014"/&gt; Having featured regularly during the first month of the season, he was ruled out until October through injury before making his return in a 5–2 victory over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] where he scored his first goal in the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10728357.afc-bournemouth-arter-boosted-by-big-name-arrivals/ |title=Arter boosted by big name arrivals |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter's season ended on 5 April 2014 when he received a straight red card following a foul on [[Junior Hoilett]] during a 2–1 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], gaining a three-match ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11130088.afc-bournemouth-dismissed-arter-relieved-by-victory/ |title=Dismissed Harry Arter relieved by Cherries victory |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the side to a tenth placed finish in their first season in the Championship, the highest placed finish and points total in the club's history,&lt;ref name="push"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11190360.afc-bournemouths-arter-record-finish-meaningless-without-promotion-push-next-season/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Cherries' record finish meaningless without promotion push next season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited Howe with bringing the best out of the club's players and improving his own game in "leaps and bounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11234457.afc-bournemouths-arter-players-should-be-grateful-to-eddie-howe/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Players should be grateful to manager Eddie Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=24 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15====

Despite their record finish, Arter was keen to push for promotion at the start of the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|2014–15 season]] and claimed he would see the season as a failure if the club did not at least reach the playoffs.&lt;ref name="push"/&gt; On 25 October 2014, Arter played as Bournemouth beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 8–0 away to set a club record win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29669693 |title=Birmingham City 0–8 Bournemouth|work=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2014 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season Arter and midfielder [[Andrew Surman]] formed a strong partnership, with Arter more the attacking and Surman the more defensive of the two, with Arter praising his midfield teammate – describing him as "He’s a top player and one we’re fortunate to have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11468907.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-surman-is-perfect-for-our-patient-approach/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Andrew Surman is perfect for our patient approach |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter was named the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) Player of the Month award for December 2014, after scoring in all five matches he played during the month but lost out to Ipswich Town forward [[Daryl Murphy]] in the Football League equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11720837.afc-bournemouth-cherries-star-harry-arter-wins-pfa-player-of-the-month-award/ |title=Cherries star Harry Arter wins PFA player of the month award |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded for his form by signing an improved three and a half year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11731142.afc-bournemouth-arter-targets-fairytale-end-to-cherries-journey/ |title=Harry Arter targets fairytale end to Cherries journey |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter became known for his left footed strikes from range, notably scoring the second goal in the 3–0 home victory over promotion rivals [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and first goal in the 1–1 away draw against second placed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31882584 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 March 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2015, Arter played in the 3–0 home victory against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], the win all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32377069 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Bolton Wanderers |work=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, he scored the second goal in the 3–0 away win against his former club Charlton, the win fully sealed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match in injury time, the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759 |title=Charlton Athletic 0–3 Bournemouth |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into England's top flight in the club's 125-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fchd.info/AFC-BOUR.HTM |title=AFC Bournemouth |publisher=Football Club History Database |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16====

Following the end of their Championship winning season, Arter sustained a groin injury while on international duty that made him a major doubt for the club's opening fixtures in the [[Premier League]]. After being advised to rest for several weeks, Arter was hopeful of returning in time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13327656.afc-bournemouth-arter-vowing-to-be-ready-for-start-of-pre-season/ |title=Arter vowing to be ready for start of pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually forced to undergo surgery on the problem after visiting a specialist in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13712774.afc-bournemouth-arter-takes-first-steps-on-comeback-trail/ |title=Arter takes first steps on comeback trail |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his first team return on 28 October 2015, playing in the club's 1–0 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13924795.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-it-was-like-harry-arter-had-never-been-away/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: It was like Harry Arter had never been away |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut four days later, on 1 November 2015, as he played 73 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Adam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34630316 |title=Southampton 2–0 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his return was credited with helping the club achieve an upturn in fortunes.&lt;ref name="worst"/&gt;

On 12 December 2015, Arter played in a 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], just days after his wife had given birth to their still born daughter. Despite his grief, he met with manager Howe prior to the match, telling him "I’m training today and playing tomorrow if you want to select me.

====Later years====

Prior to the start of the 2016–17 season, Arter signed a new three-year deal with Bournemouth, set to run until 2019, and called on the squad to aim to improve on the previous season and not simply target avoiding relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14557418.afc-bournemouth-star-arter-more-needed-from-whole-squad-for-premier-boost-not-just-one-or-two/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Arter: More needed from whole squad for Premier boost... not just one or two |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United in the opening game, Arter was sent off in the following match, a 1–0 defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], after receiving a second yellow card for fouling [[Cheikhou Kouyate]]. His first yellow was received for dissent after Premier League officials announced stricter rules on any show of disrespect towards match officials. Despite his sending off, Arter stated "The manager has said if I change the way I play then I become a different player. I just need to cut out those silly bookings chatting back to referees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14744419.afc-bournemouth-star-harry-arter-i-wont-change-the-way-i-play/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Harry Arter: I won't change the way I play |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Meldrum |first=Neil |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started Bournemouth's first 21 league games of the season and earned praise for his firm but was dropped from the side for a match against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in January 2017. He stated that he "hated" being left out of the squad but was restored to the starting line-up for the following match, scoring his first goal of the season in a 6–3 defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15099147.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-i-hated-being-left-out-and-will-give-everything-to-make-sure-it-does-not-happen-again/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: I hated being left out and will give everything to make sure it does not happen again |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter made 35 appearances for Bournemouth during the 2016–17 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/8050/Harry-Arter/stats?co=1&amp;se=54 |title=Harry Arter statistics |publisher=Premier League |date=28 May 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; being rewarded with a new three-year contract set to run until 2021 at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/national/15410315.harry-arter-agrees-new-four-year-deal-with-bournemouth/ |title=Harry Arter agrees new four-year deal with Bournemouth |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Howe praised Arter for improving his disciplinary record, stating that, although he "still had that fiery streak," he had "matured" as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15269113.harry-has-been-able-to-control-his-emotions-a-lot-better-says-howe/ |title=Harry has been able to control his emotions a lot better says Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During pre-season for the 2017–18 season, Arter was monitored by Bournemouth over fitness concerns after playing the majority of the previous season with an achilles injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15360396.arter-will-be-managed-through-pre-season/ |title=Arter will be managed through pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=21 June 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 2017, Arter received media attention after controversially tricking [[Nathaniel Chalobah]] into leaving a free shot on goal by pretending to be one of Chalobah's teammates in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10999130/harry-arter-should-have-been-booked-for-watford-impersonation-says-dermot-gallagher |title=Harry Arter should have been booked for Watford impersonation, says Dermot Gallagher |publisher=Sky Sports |date=21 August 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having started all of his club's opening five matches, he suffered an injury and after returning to the squad following an international break he was unable to regain his first team place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15622716.much-worse-things-in-life-can-happen-arter-reflects-on-being-dropped-from-premier-league-starting-line-up/ |title='Much worse things in life can happen' – Harry Arter reflects on being dropped from Premier League starting line-up |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=26 October 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 13 appearances over the course of the season, his final start coming during a 2–2 draw with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="hard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/16402063.cherries-midfielder-harry-arter-hopes-hard-graft-will-pay-off/ |title=Cherries midfielder Harry Arter hopes hard graft will pay off |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of playing time, manager Howe stated that Arter was not for sale after he was heavily linked with a transfer to rival Premier League side West Ham United, with Arter declaring he was "100% committed" to Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15923738.harry-arter-100-per-cent-committed-to-cherries/ |title=Harry Arter '100 per cent committed' to Cherries |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City (loan)===
Despite stating his desire to remain with Bournemouth in an attempt to force his way back into the first team,&lt;ref name="hard"/&gt; on 9 August 2018, Arter joined newly promoted Premier League side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the 2018–19 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/harry-arter-cardiff-city-bournemouth-15010649 |title=Cardiff City announce the signing of Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter on season-long loan |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Ian Mitchelmore |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting a similar offer from Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.football.london/watford-fc/transfer-news/watford-transfer-cardiff-arter-bournemouth-15010952 |title=Harry Arter rejects Watford approach in favour of move to Cardiff City - reports |website=football.london |last=Spencer |first=Phil |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bournemouth manager Howe admitted that he had taken the decision "reluctantly" as Arter was determined to play first team football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/harry-arter-bournemouth-2-394787 |title=Eddie Howe explains Why Harry Arter Left Bournemouth |website=balls.ie |last=Cooney |first=Gavin |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being ineligible to play against his parent club Bournemouth on the opening day of the season, Arter made his debut for Cardiff in a 0–0 draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 18 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45153217 |title=Cardiff City 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early performances for the club earned praise from Cardiff manager [[Neil Warnock]] who described Arter's contribution as "vital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/harry-arter-inspired-shift-behind-15095942 |title=The Harry Arter-inspired shift behind the scenes at Cardiff City that fills Neil Warnock with survival hope |publisher=WalesOnline |last=Booth |first=Dominic |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Arter played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] under-15, [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] teams, being eligible through his [[Sligo]]-born grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/bournemouth-s-harry-arter-in-ireland-provisional-squad-for-poland-1.2136697|date=12 March 2015|title=Bournemouth's Harry Arter in Ireland provisional squad for Poland|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Republic of Ireland manager [[Martin O'Neill]] said that Arter was on his radar and could be called up to the squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish/2015/0203/677626-oneill-planning-flexible-approach-to-poland-clash/|publisher=RTÉ|date=4 February 2015|title=Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Harry Arter is on his radar|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first call-up for that game on 12 March, following what O'Neill described as a "very good season",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Ned|title=AFC Bournemouth: Cherries midfielder Harry Arter handed maiden Republic of Ireland call-up|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/cherries/clubnews/11851576.AFC_Bournemouth__Arter_handed_maiden_Republic_of_Ireland_call_up/?ref=mac|accessdate=23 March 2015|newspaper=Bournemouth Echo|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not play in it. He made his senior debut on 7 June 2015, as a 63rd-minute substitute for [[Glenn Whelan]] in a 0–0 draw in a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] at the [[Aviva Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=R. of Ireland 0–0 England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32949838|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full international debut against the Netherlands in a 1–1 draw in Dublin on 27 May 2016, in which he was awarded man of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/republic-ireland-holland-international-friendly-match-report |title=Luuk de Jong denies Republic of Ireland morale-boosting win over Holland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Hytner |first=David |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later ruled out of Ireland's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishnews.com/sport/2016/05/31/news/harry-arter-out-of-running-for-euro-squad-spot-541872/ |title=Harry Arter out of running for Euro squad spot |newspaper=The Irish News |last=Spellman |first=Damian |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter made his senior competitive debut for the Republic of Ireland in a 1–0 away win over [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 12 November 2016 in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group D|World Cup qualifying]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diallo|first=Raf|title=Harry Arter reveals how Martin O'Neill "got a reaction" to get Ireland on track in the second half in Austria|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Harry-Arter-reveals-how-Martin-ONeill-got-a-reaction-to-get-Ireland-on-track-in-the-second-half-in-Austria|work=Newstalk|publisher=Communicorp|date=12 November 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Arter made himself unavailable for selection for two matches after a clash with assistant manager [[Roy Keane]]. After sitting out training on medical advice, Arter was confronted by Keane which led to Arter walking out of the team training session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-harry-arter-ireland-15135664 |title=What Roy Keane allegedly told Harry Arter during bust-up |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |last=Spellmore |first=Damian |date=11 September 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arter returned to the Republic of Ireland team for the [[UEFA Nations League]] game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 13 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1015/1003183-i-never-needed-roy-to-say-sorry-arter/ |title =I never needed Roy to say sorry - Arter|date=15 October 2018|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Arter is the brother-in-law of former England captain [[Scott Parker]], who is married to Arter's sister Carly. They both began their careers at Charlton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AFC Bournemouth: Harry Arter ready for Scott Parker battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30590786|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter has frequently cited Parker as a positive influence in his life. When Arter was released by Charlton and struggled to find a new club, Parker let him live in his house and paid him to do oddjobs in order to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13951299.i-would-mow-the-lawn-and-pick-up-the-kids-the-odd-jobs-that-helped-harry-arter-reach-the-premier-league/ |title='I would mow the lawn and pick up the kids' - the odd jobs that helped Harry Arter reach the Premier League |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=7 November 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Harry Arter and his partner, Rachel, suffered a family tragedy when their daughter died at birth. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe paid tribute to Arter following a 2–1 win over Manchester United on 12 December. Howe dedicated the win to Arter and said it had been "a hugely emotional week for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe pays tribute to Harry Arter after death of his child |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-pays-tribute-to-harry-arter-after-death-of-his-child-34282294.html |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe dedicates Manchester United win to Harry Arter |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/10098535/bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-dedicates-manchester-united-win-to-harry-arter |work=Sky Sports |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Arter shared the news of his partner being pregnant again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Good news for Arter after difficult 12 months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37811865.app |work=BBC Football |date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2017, she gave birth to a baby girl, and called her Raine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-39014883|title=Bournemouth's Harry Arter thanks fans for baby congratulations|date=18 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph William Ralls''' (born 13 October 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] as a [[midfielder]]. After playing at youth level for local teams [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] and [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]], Ralls joined the youth academy at Cardiff City after being spotted by scouts from the club. He made his professional debut for the ''Bluebirds'' in August 2011 before joining [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on a season-long loan deal for the 2013–14 season to gain experience. On his return to Cardiff, Ralls established himself in the first-team and has made over 200 appearances for the club in all competitions.

==Career==
===Cardiff City===
Ralls began his career at [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]],&lt;ref name="firstcontract"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ralls signs professional terms |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2467313,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024913/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2467313%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played one game for the first-team in an Aldershot Senior Cup tie against [[Bagshot F.C.|Bagshot]] at the age of just 15 after a number of senior players were rested, before joining [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]] under-16s.&lt;ref name="Snatched"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Cardiff City snatched starlet Joe Ralls away from Fulham |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-football/2011/08/31/how-cardiff-city-snatched-starlet-joe-ralls-away-from-fulham-91466-29332601/ |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was spotted by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] scouts along with Jordan Carter, a small compensation was paid by Cardiff to sign the two players. He had previously agreed to play in a trial match for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], although this was postponed before he joined Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt; He also attracted interest from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref name="Lookingback"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ytfc.net/news/article/20140526-greenwhite-ralls-1571713.aspx |title=GREEN &amp; WHITE LOOKING BACK - JOE RALLS |publisher=Yeovil Town F.C. |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Cardiff academy manager [[Neal Ardley]] has stated that he had to convince other staff at the club about Ralls after he declared his intention to offer him a contract.&lt;ref name="Stunned"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neal-ardley-reveals-stunned-response-9830546 |title=Neal Ardley reveals stunned response from Cardiff City coaches when he declared: 'I’m going to sign Joe Ralls' |publisher=WalesOnline |date=10 August 2015 |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his departure from the club, Farnborough youth coach Aidan Whelan commented "We realised from when he first joined us that he has a real talent. He was head and shoulders above players at the same age level".&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt;

After Cardiff were left with a depleted squad due to international call-ups prior to a [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] tie against [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 10 August 2011, manager [[Malky Mackay]] approached Ardley to enquire which players in the academy set-up would be ready to step into the first-team for the match. Ardley recommended Ralls, [[Deji Oshilaja]] and Mamadou Diallo to Mackay and Ralls and Oshilaja were eventually named on the substitutes bench for the match. Mackay later revealed that he knew very little about Ralls prior to his inclusion in the match.&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt; Ralls was brought on after 67 minutes in place of [[Andrew Taylor (footballer, born 1986)|Andrew Taylor]] to make his professional debut at the age of 17 as Cardiff went on to win 3–1 in extra-time.&lt;ref name="Cardiffdebut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Oxford Utd 1&amp;nbsp;– 3 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/14383989.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was handed his first start in the second round of the competition against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] 13 days later, playing 81 minutes before being replaced by [[Peter Whittingham]].&lt;ref name="Firststart"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14539104 |title=Cardiff City 5–3 Huddersfield Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His progression into the first-team saw him handed his first professional contract by the club on 30 September 2011, later commenting "It's a fantastic feeling to have signed professionally with a club like Cardiff City".&lt;ref name="firstcontract"/&gt; Ralls made his league debut just 48 hours after signing the contract, being brought on after just 10 minutes of a match against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] following an injury to forward [[Kenny Miller]], scoring a stunning volley for his first senior goal as Cardiff went on to lose 2–1.&lt;ref name="firstgoal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hull 2–1 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15045293.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first league start came on 10 December in a goalless draw at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]],&lt;ref name="Leaguedebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16015832 |title=Millwall 0–0 Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to finish his first season in the first-team squad having made 14 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref name="Games played by Joe Ralls in 2011/2012"&gt;{{Soccerbase season|61254|2011|name=Joe Ralls|access-date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Yeovil Town====
Following Cardiff's promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2012–13 season, Ralls was made available for loan due to the lack of first-team opportunities available in the top tier, joining newly promoted [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on loan on 14 August until January 2014 to gain experience.&lt;ref name="Experience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-midfielder-joe-ralls-5734719 |title= Cardiff City midfielder Joe Ralls joins Yeovil Town on loan |publisher=WalesOnline |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeovilloan"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23715305 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper's injury halts Yeovil loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 17 August after coming on as a substitute in place of [[Kevin Dawson (footballer, born 1990)|Kevin Dawson]] during a 2–0 defeat to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeovildebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23644641 |title=Burnley 2–0 Yeovil Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the ''Glovers'' in his fourth appearance for the club on 14 September, netting his team's only goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]],&lt;ref name="firstyeovilgoal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23999421 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 1–1 Yeovil Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first goal the team had scored since [[Ed Upson]]'s winning goal on the opening day of the season a month previously.&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt;

Ralls expressed his satisfaction with joining the ''Glovers'', stating "Yeovil has worked out really well and I know I’ll improve my game here before I return to Cardiff.”&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt; He briefly returned to Cardiff following the expiration of his loan deal following the appointment of [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] as Cardiff manager in order for the Norwegian to assess his squad, missing Yeovil's [[FA Cup]] victory over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].&lt;ref name="Yeovilextension"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25697194 |title=Transfer window: Yeovil Town extend Joe Ralls loan from Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Yeovil keen on extending the loan deal,&lt;ref name="waitinggame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/yeovil-town-play-waiting-game-pursuit-cardiff/story-20410170-detail/story.html |title=Yeovil Town play waiting game in pursuit of Cardiff City midfielder Joe Ralls and Nottingham Forest striker Ishmael Miller while ruling out move for Plymouth Argyle skipper Conor Hourihane |publisher=Western Morning News |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 January 2014, Ralls agreed an extension to his loan with Yeovil until the end of the season.&lt;ref name="Yeovilextension"/&gt;

====Return to Cardiff====
[[File:Coady Ralls.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Ralls (in blue) attacking against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].]]
His performances during his loan spell with Yeovil saw Cardiff manager Solskjær to offer Ralls a three-year extension to his contract at the Cardiff City Stadium on his return to the club and was awarded the man of the match award in his first appearance of the 2014–15 season, during a 2–1 victory over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]].&lt;ref name="Starlet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-starlet-joe-ralls-7617944 |title=Cardiff City starlet Joe Ralls keen to make a big impact after impressing at Coventry City |publisher=WalesOnline |date=14 August 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the departure of Solskjær soon after, Ralls continued to thrive under newly appointed Cardiff boss [[Russell Slade]], becoming a regular in the first team during the 2014–15 season, playing mostly as a left-sided midfielder due to intense competition for places in the centre of midfield from [[Peter Whittingham]] and [[Aron Gunnarsson]],&lt;ref name="Asset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/joe-ralls-now-real-asset-10474406 |title=Joe Ralls now a real asset says Russell Slade after midfielder signs new Cardiff City contract |publisher=WalesOnline |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; altogether playing 31 games and scoring 4 goals, before being handed a new five-year contract with the club set to run until 2020, to which manager Slade stated that he was "delighted" to keep Ralls at the club.&lt;ref name="Asset"/&gt;

At the start of the following season, he was handed the number 8 shirt and started in the left-sided midfield role against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on the opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squad number 2015/16 |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-201516-2598955.aspx |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff 1–1 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33744136 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2015 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls scored his only goal of the campaign in January against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–3 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35269833 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls effort throughout the season had earned him the Young Player of the year award, whilst Cardiff just missed out on a play-off place to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref name="Youngplayeraward"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City end of season awards RECAP: Matthew Connolly named Player of the Year |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-end-season-awards-11299527 |work=South Wales Echo |author=Tucker, S, Smith, P |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Ralls signs fresh Cardiff City contract |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34873834 |work=BBC Sport |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralls celebrated his 100th appearance for Cardiff, by scoring a spectacular goal from 25 yards out against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in August, also opening his accounts for the [[2016–17 Cardiff City F.C. season|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fulham 2 – 2 Cardiff |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/fulham-vs-cardiff/358150 |work=Sky Sports Football |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for Player of the Month in January, following impressive performances scoring two against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and seeing Cardiff rise from the relegation battle to mid-table spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ralls nominated for Player of the Month |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/ralls-nominated-for-jan-sky-bet-championship-player-of-the-month-3564099.aspx |publisher=Cardiff City Official Sit |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ralls received his first international call for the [[England national under-19 football team|England Under-19s]] to replace the injured [[Robert Hall (footballer)|Robert Hall]] to play [[Czech Republic national under-19 football team|Czech Republic]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squad named for Czech test |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u19s/News/Match%20Centre/2012/EnglandvCzechRep/Match-Previews/squad-announcement.aspx |publisher=The Football Association |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls came on in the games to make his English debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malky Mackay thrilled with Joe Ralls’ England call-up |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city/cardiff-city-fc/2012/03/03/malky-mackay-thrilled-with-joe-ralls-england-call-up-91466-30448643/? |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Primarily a central midfield player, Ralls featured frequently at left midfield and left back during the early stages of his career at Cardiff and Yeovil, commenting that, although not a natural in either position, he can "do a job there" but admitted that he does "naturally tend to drift inside" when playing out of position.&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt; Ralls has described himself as a box-to-box midfielder that "likes to get forward as much as possible".&lt;ref name="yeovillife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/ralls-enjoying-moment-time-glovers/story-19712869-detail/story.html |title=Ralls is enjoying every moment of his time with the Glovers |publisher=Somerset Live |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danny Ward''' (born {{birth date|df=yes|1980|6|15}}), also known by the [[nickname]] of '''"Wardy"''',&lt;ref name="Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrl.com/andrew-henderson-explains-left-london-successor-danny-ward|title=Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward|publisher=Total RL|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] in the [[Super League]], and an English former professional [[rugby league]] footballer who played in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. At international level, he played for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]], and at club level for the [[Leeds Rhinos]], [[Castleford Tigers]], [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[London Broncos#2006–2011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] in the [[Super League]].

Ward was previously [[Andrew Henderson (rugby league)|Andrew Henderson]]'s assistant coach at the [[London Broncos]], and had held this position since 2015. Prior to this, he was head coach of the Under-19s.

==Background==
Ward was born in [[Dewsbury]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

==Leeds Rhinos==
Ward is the son of former Leeds captain and coach [[David Ward (rugby league)|David Ward]]. He was signed for Leeds from Dewsbury Moor, and he made his début as a substitute against [[Sheffield Eagles]] in 1999. He was named the Leeds Alliance Player of the Year in 2000, before becoming a regular first team member the following season.

Ward first played at international level for the Great Britain Academy before being selected for [[John Kear]]'s England Under-21 squad for the tour of South Africa at the end of the 2001 season. England won the First Test 112–6 in the first test and the second 74–14. In 2002 he was selected in the England 'A' squad to play New Zealand at [[Griffin Park]], losing 12–34. He then was part of the squad to tour Fiji and Tonga. One of his highlights in 2002 was a [[Drop goal#Rugby league|drop goal]] in a victory at the Boulevard on his 21st birthday.

Ward emulated his father by playing in the [[Challenge Cup]] Final in 2003. In 2004 he made 14 first team starts and 12 substitute appearances, and scored a [[try]] in the 46–28 win over Wakefield. Ward played for the [[Leeds Rhinos]] at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2004 Super League Grand Final]] victory against the [[Bradford Bulls]]. In 2004 Ward made the transition into the senior Great Britain team making his début as a substitute against New Zealand in the Tri Nations competition.
[[Image:Danny Ward.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ward in action for Harlequins RL]]
As [[Super League IX]] champions, the Rhinos faced [[2004 NRL season]] premiers, the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]]. Ward played as a {{rlp|pr}} in Leeds' 39–32 victory. In his final season with Leeds, Ward scored a try in the [[2005 Challenge Cup]] Final against Hull and in the Grand Final qualifying win at St. Helens that took the Rhinos back to [[Old Trafford]] for the Grand Final. He played for the Rhinos at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2005 Super League Grand Final]] loss against [[Bradford Bulls]]. He left Leeds before the 2006 Super League season to join Castleford.

==Castleford Tigers==

At the beginning of the 2006's [[Super League XI]], Ward was released after an unsavoury incident. He joined the [[Castleford Tigers]], who had just been promoted from National League One. Ward adapted well to his new surroundings and one of his highlights that year was a try in the 31–30 victory over his former employers at the Jungle. However, his efforts were not enough to save Castleford from relegation.

==Hull Kingston Rovers==

For the 2007 season, he like [[Luke Dyer]], a teammate of his at Castleford, moved east to pastures new at Craven Park with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. So far, Ward has yet to make the impact that he did at both Leeds and Castleford, but his presence presents a danger to any defence in the whole of [[Super League]].

==Harlequins Rugby League==
He was released from Hull KR on 17 September 2007. He signed a two-year deal with [[London Broncos#Harlequins RL .282006.E2.80.932011.29|Harlequins]] starting from the 2008 season.&lt;ref name="Prop Ward secures Harlequins move"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/7012934.stm|title=Prop Ward secures Harlequins move|publisher=BBC|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Ward was the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] Under-19s for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was currently the assistant coach in 2015 and 2017.

He was promoted to head coach from the beginning of the 2018 season. Ward took charge of his first professional game with a 56-12 victory over the [[Barrow Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://londonbroncosrl.com/news/broncos-beat-barrow-with-storming-win-in-season-opener/ |title=Broncos beat Barrow with storming win in season opener|work=London Broncos|date=7 February 2018|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albin Kenneth Dahrup Zohore'''&lt;ref name="FIFAU17-squadlist" /&gt; (born 31 January 1994) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

He began his career in his native Denmark, making his professional debut for [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] at the age of 16, becoming the youngest player to play in the [[Danish Superliga]]. Regarded as a promising youngster, he joined Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in 2012 but struggled to break into the first-team and, following loan spells with [[Brøndby IF]] and [[IFK Göteborg]], he returned to Denmark on a permanent basis by joining [[Odense Boldklub|OB]] in 2015.

==Personal life==
Zohore was born in [[Copenhagen]] to a Danish mother and an Ivorian father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/superligaen/fcks-zohore-drogba-er-min-mentor |title=FCK's Zohore: Drogba er min mentor |publisher=bt.dk |language=Danish |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.violanews.com/altre-news/lex-viola-zohore-tiene-a-galla-per-ora-litalia/ |title=L’ex viola Zohore regala la qualificazione all’Italia |publisher=Viola News |author=Federico Generelli |language=Italian |date=24 June 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is the second cousin of former Chelsea striker [[Didier Drogba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCK's Zohore: Drogba is my mentor|url=http://www.sporten.dk/superligaen/fcks-zohore-drogba-er-min-mentor|work=Sporten.dk|publisher=[[Sporten.dk]]|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Copenhagen===
After spells with [[BK Skjold]] and  [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]], Zohore joined the youth system at [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], being promoted to the under-19 squad at the age of 15 in 2009. He joined the first-team's training camp in [[Marbella]], Spain, on 2 February 2010 together with Thobias Skovgaard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=754&amp;newsid=9963 |title=Afrejse tirsdag |accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=2010-02-01 |publisher=F.C. Copenhagen |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut for the club on 7 March 2010, at the age of 16 years and 35 days old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superstats.dk/spillere/alder-alltime |title=Yngst/aeldst |publisher=superstats.dk |language=Danish |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the youngest player to ever make his debut in the [[Danish Superliga]] after replacing [[César Santin]] in the 73rd minute during a 5–0 victory against [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]].&lt;ref name="skifter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=12286 |title=Kenneth Zohore skifter til Fiorentina |accessdate=2010-03-07 |date=2012-01-31 |publisher=[[fck.dk]] |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114933/http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=12286 |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rise-fall-rise-again-kenneth-12628614 |title=The rise, fall and rise again of Kenneth Zohore: An insight into Cardiff City's prodigious talent who lost his way |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Dominic Booth |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the match was his only appearance for the first-team during the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref name="Soccerway"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/kenneth-dahrup-zohore/136137/ |title=K. Zohore |publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2010, Zohore made his first [[UEFA Champions League]] appearance for Copenhagen, playing against [[FC Barcelona]] at [[Camp Nou]]. The 16-year-old striker replaced [[César Santin]] in the 74th minute of the game, becoming one of the youngest players ever to play in the Champion's League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/23/10-youngest-champions-league-debutants-including-juventus-moise/kenneth-zohore/ |title=The 10 youngest Champions League debutants including Juventus' Moise Kean – how did their careers pan out? |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, he scored his first senior goal for FC Copenhagen in the Danish Superliga against [[Lyngby Boldklub]]. He is the second youngest goalscorer ever in the Danish Superliga, after [[Mads Beierholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superstats.dk/spillere/alder-alltime?vis=MaalYngst |title=Yngste Malscorere, All-Time |publisher=superstats.dk |language=Danish |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zohore attracted attention from numerous clubs around Europe, spending time on trial at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], also being approached by Chelsea player Didier Drogba after the two sides met in a Champions League fixture, and [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/den-nye-bendtner |title=Den nye Bendtner (The new Bendtner) |accessdate=2010-03-07 |date=2010-02-05 |publisher=[[Sporten.dk]] |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances saw him described as "one of the top striking prospects anywhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/6820678/zohore-reveals-drogba-chat |title=Zohore reveals Drogba 'chat' |publisher=Sky Sports |author=Richard Torgerson |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiorentina &amp; loan spells===
On 31 January 2012, FC Copenhagen announced that Zohore had signed for Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina]] on his 18th birthday for a fee in the region of £1 million.&lt;ref name="skifter"/&gt; He was given shirt no. 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legaseriea.it/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c539b06c-4a16-4487-8fe1-83f9efefdfb5&amp;groupId=10192 |title=Comunicati Stampa N°123 (2011–12) |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |publisher=Lega Serie A |language=Italian }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zohore never featured for the first team, later stating that he was "too young" to cope with the strong competition for places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/europei/2017/06/25/zohore-dalla-fiorentina-spinge-l-italia-in-semifinale.html |title=Da meteora viola a eroe, l'Italia ringrazia Zohore |publisher=Sky Sports |language=Italian |date=25 June 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2013, [[Brøndby IF]], managed by Zohore's former coach at Danish youth levels [[Thomas Frank (football manager)|Thomas Frank]], announced that they had agreed a deal with [[ACF Fiorentina]] to sign Zohore on a season-long loan with the option to buy at the end of the year for between €2.2 and €2.3 million.&lt;ref name="bt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.dk/superligaen/saadan-har-broendby-kokset-i-zohore-handel |title=Sådan har Brøndby kokset i Zohore-handel |publisher=bt.dk |language=Danish |date=28 July 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2013/08/08/kenneth-zohore-til-broendby-if |title=Kenneth Zohore to Brøndby IF |publisher=Brøndby IF |language=Danish |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brøndby paid a loan fee of nearly €100,000 to secure the move, beating off competition from German side [[Hannover 96]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jv.dk/sport/Saa-meget-skal-Broendby-betale-for-Zohore/artikel/1593204 |title=Så meget skal Brøndby betale for Zohore |publisher=Jydske Vestkysten |author=Søren Sorgenfri |language=Danish |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  however the transfer nearly collapsed close to completion as Brøndby were unaware of their need to pay Zohore's wages during the loan spell but the loan was eventually completed.&lt;ref name="bt"/&gt; Brøndby were hopeful of completing the transfer on a permanent basis but were unable to meet Fiorentina's valuation.&lt;ref name="juble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://3point.dk/zohore-vil-ikke-juble-hvis-han-scorer-mod-brondby/ |title=Zohore vil ikke juble, hvis han scorer mod Brøndby |publisher=3point.dk |author=Nanna Møller Karlsen |language=Danish |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2014 [[IFK Göteborg]] announced that Zohore had joined the club on a loan deal from Fiorentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/Nyheter/2014/Augusti/Klart-med-Zohore/ | title=Klart med Zohore | publisher=IFK Göteborg | date=11 August 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2014 | language=Swedish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915032129/http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/Nyheter/2014/Augusti/Klart-med-Zohore/# | archive-date=2014-09-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut 13 August 2014 in an away game against Åtvidaberg BK coming on as a substitute. In his home game debut against Brommapojkarna, 17 August 2014, Zohore scored his first goal for IFK Göteborg when he only had been on the pitch three minutes after coming on as a substitute in the 83rd minute.

===Odense Boldklub===
On 3 February 2015, Zohore returned to the Danish Superliga with [[Odense Boldklub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ob.dk/artikel/ob-skriver-kontrakt-med-kenneth-zohore.aspx |title=OB skriver kontrakt med Kenneth Zohore |accessdate=3 February 2015 |date=3 February 2015 |publisher=Odense Boldklub |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the termination of his contract with Fiorentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ob.dk/artikel/ob-saelger-kenneth-zohore.aspx|title=OB sælger Kenneth Zohore|last=Wamsler|first=Morten|date=1 February 2016|website=|publisher=Odense Boldklub|language=Danish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smithies previously played football for Westend Juniors in Huddersfield's local leagues, and he joined the Huddersfield Town academy at the age of 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/06/26/huddersfield-town-keeper-alex-smithies-invites-the-examiner-round-for-a-cuppa-86081-23984750/3/ |title=Huddersfield Town Keeper Alex Smithies Invites The Examiner Round for a Cuppa |publisher=Huddersfield Examiner |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Huddersfield Town===
====Early seasons 2007–2009====
[[File:Alex Smithies.jpg|thumb|upright|Smithies with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] after the [[2012 Football League One play-off Final|2012 League One play-off Final]]]]

Having come through the Academy of the club he grew up supporting, Smithies made his first-team debut on 5 December 2007. He came on as a 76th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for the red-carded [[Matt Glennon]] during Huddersfield Town's 4–1 defeat by [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] at [[Roots Hall]]. His first full start came in the 4–0 defeat at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 8 December, after Glennon lost an appeal against his dismissal and Town were refused permission to loan an emergency goalkeeper on the grounds that Smithies was registered as a professional.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Smithies' first appearance at the [[Galpharm Stadium]] for a first-team match was on 6 December 2008. In this match, caretaker manager [[Gerry Murphy (football manager)|Gerry Murphy]] dropped regular goalkeeper Matt Glennon in favour of the young custodian, who went on to help Huddersfield to a 2–1 victory over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. The first clean sheet he kept for the club came on 13 December 2008. In the 1–0 win over Southend United, Smithies saved a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] from [[James Walker (footballer, born 1987)|James Walker]], 10 minutes from time. Smithies became the first choice keeper for the remainder of the [[2008–09 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2008–09 season]] and, after the arrival of manager [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], made the number one jersey his own.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====2009–10 season and first team====
Throughout the [[2009–10 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2009–10 season]], Smithies was the only player to play in each and every league and cup match for Huddersfield. He made 48 starts, 17 of which resulted in a clean sheet for the Terriers. His contribution in helping Huddersfield to a final position inside the League One playoffs was reflected by him winning the club's Young Player of the Year Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htafc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10312~2052530,00.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516173032/http://www.htafc.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10312~2052530%2C00.html|date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conceding just 56 goals in such a competitive campaign, he won both praise and admiration from many quarters; earning the Football League's 'Young Player of the Month' award in February 2010 along the way. On 17 November 2009 Smithies was linked with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] after a scout from the club was the latest in a long string of [[Premier League]] interest to be seen at the Galpharm. This interest was played down by Lee Clark and [[Tony Coton]], and Smithies insisted he was happy to be at Huddersfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11740_5700303,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Smithies happy at Huddersfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithies was named as the [[Football League Young Player of the Month]] for February 2010 after keeping three clean sheets in seven undefeated Huddersfield Town matches.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20100315/smithies-claims-young-player-prize_2293334_1995019 |title=Smithies claims Young Player prize |publisher=The Football League |date=15 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726094741/http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20100315/smithies-claims-young-player-prize_2293334_1995019 |archivedate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
Smithies' 2010–11 campaign was punctuated by injury, restricting him to just 27 appearances in all competitions throughout the season. His performances, on the occasions he did play, earned him a call up to the England under-21 squad, although he was unable to play – again due to injury.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In January 2011, he was linked with a £1.5m move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], after Villa manager [[Gérard Houllier]] was said to have been impressed with his performance against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Transfer-news-Aston-Villa-are-lining-up-a-1-5million-bid-for-Huddersfields-England-Under-21-goalkeeper-Alex-Smithies-article664059.html |title=Aston Villa are lining up a 1.5&amp;nbsp;million bid for Huddersfield's England Under-21 goalkeeper Alex Smithies |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=12 July 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further speculation relating to his future at the club followed Huddersfield's 3–0 defeat against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in the League One play-off final, and he was linked with a move to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], along with teammate [[Lee Peltier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomson |first=Doug |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/huddersfield-town-fc/huddersfield-town-news/2011/06/03/alex-smithies-and-lee-peltier-could-be-set-to-leave-huddersfield-town-86081-28812280/ |title=Alex Smithies and Lee Peltier could be set to leave Huddersfield Town |publisher=Huddersfield Examiner |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Leicester had a bid for [[Kasper Schmeichel]] accepted by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in June, speculation that Smithies could be heading for Leeds was rejected by Huddersfield chief executive Nigel Clibbens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hay |first=Phil |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/leeds_united_smithies_is_a_big_asset_insist_huddersfield_town_1_3511796 |title=Leeds United: Smithies is a big asset insist Huddersfield Town |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |location=Leeds |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season and promotion====
Smithies' absence from the squad during 2010–11 through injury allowed [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]] to become first choice goalkeeper, backed up by fellow veteran [[Nick Colgan]]. His injury meant he remained sidelined for the first half of the season, and had to wait until 14 February 2012 to make his first appearance in the [[2011–12 Football League One|2011–12]] campaign. This came in the 1–0 home defeat to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], a result which would cost manager Lee Clark his job the following day.&lt;ref name=HuddersVBlades&gt;{{cite news |title=Huddersfield Town 0–1 Sheffield United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16921915 |accessdate=14 February 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by his first clean sheet of the campaign in Huddersfield's 2–0 home win over [[Exeter City]] on 25 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17083206 |title=Huddersfield 2–0 Exeter |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second leg [[EFL League One|League One]] play-off match against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] he came on as a substitute for Bennett, who had gone off with an injured hand. Town lost the match 2–1 but reached the final against Sheffield United 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Woodcock |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17989104 |title=Hudd'field 1–2 MK Dons (agg 3–2) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithies started in the final, which finished 0–0 thanks to some excellent saves from the young custodian.  In the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] Smithies performed more heroics, saving three of the Sheffield penalties.  After 10 penalties each, the sides were still inseparable, and Smithies and opposite number [[Steve Simonsen]] stepped up to take the next penalties for their sides. Smithies scored in emphatic fashion, before Simonsen put his penalty over the bar to give promotion to the terriers.&lt;ref name=2012PO&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18127853 |title=Huddersfield 0–0 Sheff Utd |first=Emlyn |last=Begley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122123429/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18127853 |archivedate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
On 17 August 2012, Smithies began his debut season in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] with Huddersfield in a 1–0 away defeat at eventual league winners [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19205087 |title=Cardiff 1–0 Huddersfield |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133470 |title=Burnley 1–1 Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to start all 46 of Huddersfield's Championship fixtures, as well as all but one of the clubs five cup matches during the season, conceding 79 goals in the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====2013–14 season====
Smithies started his second season in the Championship how he started his first, by starting all Huddersfield's opening eleven fixtures in all competitions, conceding 10 goals during that time. On 25 September 2013, Smithies agreed a new one-year contract extension at the club, keeping him at the [[John Smith's Stadium]] at least until the summer of 2016, with the Club having the option for a further year to June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Nelson |url=http://www.htafc.com/news/article/first-team-news-alex-new-deal-2016-1076811.aspx |title='Keeper signs one year contract extension |publisher=Huddersfield Town Football Club |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He conceded four goals on the opening day in a 4–0 home defeat to [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], but did save a penalty. The match would prove to be manager [[Mark Robins]]' last for the club.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 20 August 2015, Smithies joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Nelson |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/news/article/alex-smithies-joins-qpr-huddersfield-town-transfer-2634611.aspx |title=QPR SIGN KEEPER ALEX SMITHIES |date=20 August 2015 |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
Smithies was initially the backup goalkeeper to [[Robert Green|Rob Green]]. Due to a clause in his contract, Green did not play from 1 January 2016 to the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=QPR not playing Rob Green because of contract clause |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11711/10201779/qpr-not-playing-rob-green-because-of-contract-clause |accessdate=12 March 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithies and [[Matt Ingram]] vied for the number 1 spot.

===Cardiff City===

On 11 August 2013, Paterson scored his first goal of the 2013–14 campaign, when he headed home the only goal in the [[Edinburgh derby]] against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at Tynecastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23565318 | title=A Callum Paterson header gave Hearts a vital victory and bragging rights in a frantic and edgy Edinburgh derby. | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | work=bbc.co.uk/sport | date=11 August 2013 | accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2014, Paterson scored a brace against city rivals Hibernian in a 2–1 win. A week later he scored again in a 5–0 win over [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and also scored three days later against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Hearts were relegated at the end of the season, but immediately won promotion by winning the [[2014–15 Scottish Championship]]. In their first season back in the top flight, Hearts finished third in the [[2015–16 Scottish Premiership]] and qualified for European competition.

During the summer of 2016, Patterson was subject to interest from several [[EFL Championship]] sides, with Hearts rejecting two bids from [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Hearts reject new Wigan bid for full-back |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37181276 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2016 |accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the interest, he stayed at the club, managing to score 9 goals in 20 appearances, before suffering a serious knee injury on 27 December, which ruled him out for six to nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Hearts right-back sidelined for six to nine months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38450959 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite missing the last few months of the season, Paterson managed to pick up the club's Young Player of the Year Award.&lt;ref name=YPLOY/&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 7 June 2017, Paterson agreed a three-year deal with [[EFL Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Scotland defender joins Cardiff City on three-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40189922 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knee injury suffered at Hearts kept him out of the first two months of the season, making his playing return for the [[Cardiff City F.C. Academy|Under-23 side]] in a 4–0 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], on 18 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U23 Match Report Burnley 0–4 Cardiff City |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/september/match-report-for-burnley-u23-vs-cardiff-city-u23-on-18-sep-17/ |publisher=Cardiff City Football Club |date=18 September 2017 |accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October, Paterson returned to the first team, making his debut in a 1–0 win over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], before scoring his first goal for the club, the winner at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41618274 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2017 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barnsley 0–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41978131 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff manager, [[Neil Warnock]] moved Paterson into a central midfield position in the new year, later stating the reasoning behind the move was because he couldn't defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42682884 |title=Callum Paterson: Cardiff 'wobble' out of way, says Scotland international |date=15 January 2018 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Warnock reveals why he won't actually play 'defender' Callum Paterson in defence |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-warnock-reveals-wont-actually-14419127 |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 March 2018 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his move to the new position, Paterson scored a brace against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 13 January and found the back of the net three times in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–0 Sunderland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42587431 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2018 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his good form throughout the rest of the season, scoring 10 goals, ending as the club's top goal scorer in the league, as they were promoted to the [[Premier League]]. Paterson was also voted Young Player of the Season by the Cardiff fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Awards 2018: The Winners |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2018/may/awards-2018/ |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=6 May 2018 |accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson played his first Premier League game against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] on the opening day of the season. As Cardiff struggled for goals, Paterson was moved into a central forward role, where he scored his first Premier League goal in a 4–2 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–2 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45847412 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Paterson earned caps at both [[Scotland national under-18 football team|under-18]] and [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] level in 2012 before establishing himself as a regular in [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu21/player.php?playerid=545|title=Scotland U21 player Callum Paterson |website=FitbaStats|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2014, manager [[Gordon Strachan]] called Paterson into the [[Scotland national football team|senior Scottish squad]] for the first time after [[Phil Bardsley]] pulled out of the squad injured, ahead of a European qualifier against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and a friendly against [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearts defender Callum Paterson called up by Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29989566|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his senior debut for Scotland on 29 May 2016 in a 1–0 friendly defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

Bacuna was capped 20 times at youth levels for the Netherlands and also represented the [[Netherlands Antilles national football team|Netherlands Antilles]] at youth level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2015/03/24/aston-villas-leandro-bacuna-hoping-for-international-future-with/|title=Aston Villa's Leandro Bacuna hoping for international future with the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacuna represents the [[Curaçao national football team|Curaçao national team]], the successor side to the Netherlands Antilles, and won the [[2017 Caribbean Cup]] with the side in July 2017.

==Club career==

===Groningen===
On 30 October 2009, Bacuna made his first team debut for [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] in an [[Eredivisie]] match against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/Spelers/Speler.htm?employer=57&amp;season=382&amp;dbid=63150&amp;typeofpage=84137|title=Cookies op VI.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacuna has also played for Groningen's youth teams. On 6 November 2009, he scored his first goal for the first team in a league match against [[Heracles Almelo]], an eventual 4–1 victory for Groningen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/sport/fodbold/article815651.ece Holland, Æresdivisionen&amp;nbsp;– Politiken.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027031438/http://politiken.dk/sport/fodbold/article815651.ece |date=2009-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===
It was announced on 13 June 2013 that Bacuna had signed a three-year contract with [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Handed the number 7 shirt, Bacuna impressed many with his debut season for the Villains, despite constantly playing out of position at right back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/242500/Groninger-Bacuna-wordt-collega-van-Vlaar-in-Engeland.htm|title=Cookies op VI.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3209128,00.html|title=Bacuna tipped to be|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615161605/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10265~3209128%2C00.html|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacuna scored his first Premier League goal on 28 September at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. His second goal came from a free-kick in the claret and blues' 2–0 victory over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He continued his goalscoring run with goals against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the [[2014–15 Aston Villa F.C. season|2014–15 season]], however, Bacuna found it harder to break into the starting line-up, starting just one game in the [[2014–15 Premier League|Premier League]]. On 15 February 2015, he scored the first of two Villa goals in the fifth round of the [[2014–15 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in a 2–1 win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], taking the club into the quarter-finals.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Akureyri]], Aron began playing football in his native Iceland on gravel pitches. During the winter months, snow and ice left football pitches unplayable and Aron instead played [[handball]], making three appearances in the Icelandic handball League at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/09/aron-gunnarsson-iceland-midfield-leader |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Iceland's midfield leader and long-throw star |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Kristján Jónsson |date=9 June 2016 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his football career with local side [[Þór Akureyri]] in 2005 and, after investment in indoor pitches by the Icelandic government, began to train all year round. At the age of seventeen, Aron moved to the Netherlands, joining the youth academy at [[AZ (football club)|AZ]].&lt;ref name="dragons"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/there-be-ice-dragons-here |title=There Be Ice Dragons Here |publisher=The Players' Tribune |author=Aron Gunnarsson |date=4 June 2018 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially struggling with homesickness, he settled in the country and made his debut for the club during the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref name="Gunnarsson, Aron Einar"/&gt;

===Coventry City===
Aron signed for English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] team [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 17 June 2008, signing a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry set to sign Gunnarsson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/7454902.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on the opening day of the Championship season against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where Coventry won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coventry City 2 – 0 Norwich City |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10269~43657,00.html |publisher=Coventry City F.C |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207185557/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10269~43657%2C00.html |archivedate=7 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first career goal on 14 February 2009 in an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Premier League]] side [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn 2–2 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7872196.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Coventry, Aron attracted [[Premier League]] interest leading Coventry City to offer him an improved deal on 12 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall is offered new Coventry deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/7940294.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first league goal came against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crystal Palace 1–1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7977127.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his first season in England, Aron was voted the Coventry City Supporter's Player of the Year as well as the club's Community Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunnarsson wins Sky Blues award |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/8033160.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Aron changed his shirt number from 12 to 17, to mirror the squad number of his brother, who is a professional handball player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News: Squad numbers announced |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10269~1728846,00.html |publisher=Coventry City F.C |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314014616/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10269~1728846%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, he continued as a vital part of the Coventry midfield, throughout the season he made 42 appearances and scored one goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 1 – 1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8632725.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coventry City started the 2010–11 season strongly looking like they were pushing for play-off places. Aron opened his season's goal scoring count with a goal against newly promoted, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], despite Coventry losing 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millwall 3 – 1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8941283.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years at Coventry, he scored his first goal at Coventry City's home ground, the [[Ricoh Arena]], against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 1 – 2 Preston |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9021245.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Aron scored his second goal in two matches against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 2 – 1 Doncaster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9031717.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was out of contract at the end of the season and on 10 December, Aron stated his desire to stay at Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson keen to sign new deal at Coventry City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/9275863.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the following week, he received his first red card of his career against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 1 – 2 Norwich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9283523.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a deal for a new contract couldn't be reached between his agent and Coventry, and at the end of the season the club gave him a deadline date to agree to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Westwood, King &amp; Gunnarsson get Coventry City deadline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/9483766.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to Aron and his agent not being able to reach an agreement with Coventry, he was linked with moves away and his agent confirmed that fellow Championship outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] were favourites to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 'among favourites' to sign Iceland star Aron Gunnarsson from Coventry City |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2011/07/05/cardiff-city-among-favourites-to-sign-iceland-star-aron-gunnarsson-from-coventry-city-91466-28992897/ |newspaper=South Wales Echo |first=Terry |last=Phillips |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===
[[File:Aron Gunnarsson.jpg|thumb|200|Aron playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2012]]
On 8 July 2011, Aron agreed a three-year deal with fellow Championship team [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a free transfer, as the fifth signing for new manager [[Malky Mackay]]. Coventry were due compensation via him being under the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aron Gunnarsson joins Cardiff City on free transfer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14089640|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut on 7 August in the first match of the new season, playing the full 90 minutes in the 1–0 away win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham 0 – 1 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14356630.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second match, Aron limped off with an ankle injury after only ten minutes against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], the injury sidelining him for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City midfielder Aron Gunnarsson sidelined for a week |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14523831.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned after the September international break, insisting his injury was behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson ready to put injury woes behind him at Cardiff City |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city-fc/2011/09/09/aron-gunnarsson-ready-to-put-injury-woes-behind-him-at-cardiff-city-91466-29389513/? |newspaper=South Wales Echo |first=Steve |last=Tucker |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October, Aron scored two goals in a 5–3 victory against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], receiving the [[man of the match]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunnar: The win was the important thing |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2490796,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C |date=22 October 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911001508/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2490796%2C00.html |archivedate=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron played the entirety of the [[2012 Football League Cup Final]], as City were beaten 3–2 on penalties after by [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff City 2–2 Liverpool: Liverpool win 3–2 on pens|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17093419|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 February 2012|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron scored Cardiff's first goal in the Premier League on 25 August 2013, against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23744629|title= Cardiff 3 Man City 2|date=25 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 he signed a new contract with the club, until the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunnarsson signs extension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32972706|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return from [[Euro 2016]], Aron was linked with a move away from the Welsh capital, with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] claimed to be interested. However, Cardiff City manager, [[Paul Trollope]], described him as "a very important player" to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City insist Aron Gunnarsson is 'very important player to us' amid Derby County and Norwich City links |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-insist-aron-gunnarsson-11764918 |work=Wales Online |first=Phil |last=Smith |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances under Trollope and his eventual replacement [[Neil Warnock]] saw him awarded the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aron-gunnarsson-big-winner-cardiff-12968468 |title=Aron Gunnarsson is the big winner in Cardiff City's 2016/17 awards as Kenneth Zohore is also honoured |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Dominic Booth |date=30 April 2017 |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Aron failed to nail down a consistent place in the starting eleven, due to a number of injuries throughout the first half of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Cardiff boss Neil Warnock hopeful of midfielder's fitness |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41595104 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his injury problems, Cardiff offered him a new contract, which was later rejected by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Iceland midfielder to leave Cardiff City after rejecting deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42181533 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron returned to the side for the final run-in, where he scored the winning goal against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and ultimately helped Cardiff gain promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 2–1 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43762401 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 April 2018 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Aron signed a new one-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Confirmed: Aron Gunnarsson signs new City deal |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2018/july/aron-gunnarsson-signs-new-city-deal/ |publisher=Cardiff City Official Site |date=9 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44769640|title=Aron Gunnarsson: Cardiff City midfielder signs new contract|date=9 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron has been a regular player in the senior side since debuting despite helping the U-21 side when they qualified for the [[UEFA Under-21 Championship]].

Aron was named as the permanent [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the national team before a friendly match against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] in August 2012 at the young age of 23, ahead of his 29th cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/sport/fotbolti/2012/08/14/aron_einar_skipadur_fyrirlidi/ |title=Aron Einar skipaður fyrirliði|publisher=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his captaincy, Iceland qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|play-off round]] of [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualification]] for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2013/10/17/world-cup-playoff-iceland-poses-problems|title=World Cup Playoff in Iceland Poses Problems|date=17 October 2013|work=Iceland Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they lost 2–0 on aggregate to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24907602|title=Croatia 2–0 Iceland|date=19 November 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greg Cunningham.JPG|thumbnail|Cunningham playing for [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester City Reserves]] in 2010]]
Born in [[Galway]], [[County Galway]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Cunningham began his career with Cregmore FC. In 2004, he joined [[Mervue United A.F.C.|Mervue United]] before earning a contract in the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Academy]]. Cunningham made his [[first team]] debut for Manchester City as a 46th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 4–2 victory over [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 24 January 2010 where he played on the left side of the City defence.&lt;ref name="Scunthorpe 2 - 4 Man City"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Lyon|title =Scunthorpe 2 – 4 Man City|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8468696.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2010|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham made his first [[Premier League]] appearance on 11 April 2010 against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as a substitute for [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]] in the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8609889.stm|title=Man City 5 – 1 Birmingham|first=Chris|last=Bevan|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 April 2010|date=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham made his second [[Premier League]] appearance on 9 May 2010 against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] as a substitute for Johnson, just 2 minutes of the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham 1 – 1 Man City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8666056.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2010, Cunningham made his European debut in Europa League Qualifiers Second Leg against [[FC Politehnica Timișoara|Politehnica Timișoara]], coming on as a 54th-minute substitute for [[Nigel de Jong]] in a 2–0 win. On 22 September 2010, Cunningham made his first start for the club and played 90 minutes in a 2-1 loss against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the [[2010–11 Football League Cup|League Cup]].

====Leicester City (loan)====
On 21 October 2010, Cunningham joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on [[loan (sports)|loan]] until January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2192184,00.html |title=Foxes Sign Man City's Cunningham |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |work=lcfc.com |accessdate=21 October 2010 |date=21 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200526/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2192184%2C00.html |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2010, Cunningham made his debut for the club in a 2–0 loss against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] where he played the full 90 minutes. Cunningham became a regular left-back in the starting eleven and made 12 starts. On 1 January 2011, Cunningham fractured his [[tibia]] in a challenge with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]'s [[Liam Rosenior]]. Rosenior was sent off and Cunningham had to be substituted in a 1–0 win for Leicester and he was ruled out of action for up to four months, which ended his loan spell at Leicester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham out for four months with broken leg|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Greg-Cunningham-months-broken-leg/story-12061039-detail/story.html|publisher=This is Leicestershire|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] say his injury was 'a complete accident' and said:

{{cquote|"To be fair, there was absolutely no intention from Liam Rosenior and it was just a very unfortunate incident. Our physio team worked immediately on the injury, comforted Greg and they were superb. However, the good start to the New Year is also a bad start for us as we have lost Greg Cunningham to a broken leg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foxes in Cunningham blow|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_reaction/0,19764,11065_3283944,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nottingham Forest (loan)====
On 25 October 2011, Cunningham joined Championship side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan until 31 December after an injury crisis at the club left them desperately on short defensive options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City's Greg Cunningham loaned to Nottingham Forest|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2011/October/Greg-Cunningham-loaned-to-Nottingham-Forest|publisher=Manchester City F.C.|work=mcfc.co.uk|first=Tim|last=Oscroft|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham Checks In |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2492606,00.html |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |work=nottinghamforest.co.uk |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028012357/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10308~2492606%2C00.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his move to Nottingham Forest, Cunningham says he expected to make an impact for the club and was looking forward to playing regularly for the club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham raring to go|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7265710/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nottingham Forest duo [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]] and [[Ishmael Miller]] agreed with Cunningham's expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forest boosted by signing|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7267521/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2011, Cunningham made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss against Hull City before being substituted early in the second-half. On 1 November 2011, Cunningham played 90 minutes in a 1–0 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Since making his debut, Cunningham became a regular in the starting eleven, playing at left back.

On 29 December, Cunningham's loan was extended until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reds Strike Deal For Greg|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2560442,00.html|date=29 December 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012|publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C.|work=nottinghamforest.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reds extend Cunningham loan|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7400900/|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|work=Sky Sports|date=29 December 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his loan was extended, manager [[Steve Cotterill]] says he would want to sign Cunningham on a permanent basis, only if the money can be found in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham continues to impress|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7402458/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his loan spell ended, Cotterill praised Cunningham (among the loan signing) for helping the club pull away from the relegation zone and stay in the Championship next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cotterill praises loan impact|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7649695/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 April 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bristol City===
The following season, Cunningham told [[BBC Sport]] he intended to leave Manchester City to further his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham ready for Manchester City exit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18721399|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 2012, Cunningham signed a four-year contract at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City defender Greg Cunningham joins Bristol City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18721392|work=BBC Sport|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham made his debut on the opening game of the season, in a 1–0 loss against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Then, in a 2–1 win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], on 18 September 2012, Cunningham received a heavy tackle from [[Tyrone Barnett]] after Barnett made a reckless challenge on him, which resulted in Cunningham being stretched off and Barnett being booked.

Born in [[Meliana]], [[Valencian Community]], Camarasa joined local [[Valencia CF]]'s youth categories in 2001, aged seven. Ten years later he was released, and eventually finished his formation with neighbouring [[Levante UD]], making his senior debuts with the [[Atlético Levante UD|reserve side]] in the [[2012–13 Segunda División B|2012–13 season]], in [[Segunda División B]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20130912/fc-barcelona/barca-levante-filial-fichajes-victor-camarasa_54381344850.html El Barça sigue a Víctor Camarasa (Barça follow Víctor Camarasa)]; [[Mundo Deportivo]], 12 September 2013 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Souleymane Bamba''' (born 13 January 1985) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast national team]] as a [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]].

Bamba started his career in his native France with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], but failed to establish himself in their first team. He moved to Scotland to join [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in 2006, helping the club reach the final of the [[Scottish Cup]] in his first season. Two years later, he was transferred to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], before joining English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in January 2011. 

He was sold to Turkish club [[Trabzonspor]] in 2012 for £750,000 before joining [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]. However, he was loaned to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after making only one appearance in six months. He eventually joined Leeds on a permanent deal and was appointed club captain, spending a further year with the club before being released and subsequently joining Cardiff City. In his first full season with Cardiff, he helped the side win promotion to the Premier League.

Born in France to Ivorian parents, Bamba represented Ivory Coast in the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympic Games]] and became a regular for the senior national side until his most recent cap in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/hibernian/2009/11/10/hibs-ace-sol-bamba-given-green-light-to-join-ivory-coast-s-world-cup-bid-86908-21810518/ |title=Hibs ace Sol Bamba given green light to join Ivory Coast's World Cup bid |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Marshall |first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was part of the side that reached the final of the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]].

==Club career==

===Paris Saint-Germain===

Bamba began his career with [[Ligue 1]] club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) at the age of 11. He had been spotted by club scouts playing street football in Paris but had initially turned the club down as his mother hoped for him to become a doctor.&lt;ref name="qa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-sol-bamba-podcast-14468355 |title=The big Sol Bamba Q &amp; A: Cardiff City star joins Blakey's Bootroom to talk promotion, Neil Warnock and all things Bluebirds |publisher=WalesOnline |last=Booth |first=Dominic |date=28 March 2018 |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his parents Sehrata and Bakary Bamba in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]],&lt;ref name="dreams"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227489219.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050047/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227489219.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Hibs' Bamba's World Cup of dreams. |newspaper=Evening News |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a suburb in central Paris. Since his family could not afford the travel to the club's training facilities outside the city, he moved away from his family home to instead live at the club's academy.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theleaguepaper.com/featured/2117/big-interview-with-leeds-uniteds-sol-bamba-adam-pearson-has-been-very-important/ |title=Big Interview with Leeds United’s Sol Bamba: “Adam Pearson has been very important” |newspaper=The Football League Paper |last=Ellis |first=Adam |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally playing as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], he converted to playing as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]] at the age of 15 after impressing there as cover for a teammate who had missed a match due to being stuck in traffic.&lt;ref name="regret"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/851229/EFL-question-and-answer-Sol-Bamba-Cardiff-City-Neil-Warnock |title=EFL Q&amp;A: Sol Bamba on his Leicester regret, Neil Warnock's music taste and proper tackling |newspaper=Sunday Express |last=Speck |first=Ivan |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite impressing for PSG's youth and B teams, he only appeared in two first team games, in his final year at the club at the age of 21.&lt;ref name = "career interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/hibs-provide-world-cup-springboard-as-bamba-comes-on-leaps-and-bounds-1-768541 |title=Hibs provide World Cup springboard as Bamba comes on leaps and bounds |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Bathgate |first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with his lack of appearances, Bamba asked to be sent out on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to gain experience but was denied by manager, [[Vahid Halilhodžić]], causing Bamba to reject PSG's offer of a new contract and subsequently leave the club.&lt;ref name = "career interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/leeds-sol-bamba-discusses-training-with-ronaldinho-and-life-at-psg/450192#QCuOuYP5b4xcMAkU.97 |title=Leeds’ Sol Bamba discusses training with Ronaldinho and life at PSG |website=squawka.com |last=Hamouda |first=Omar |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that PSG had damaged potential transfers to other French sides after he left the club, stating "I was disappointed because my club said, 'He's a good player but he's a tough guy – he doesn't listen and he can get the team into trouble."&lt;ref name="career interview"/&gt;

===Dunfermline Athletic===
After an initial trial period, Bamba signed for [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in July 2006 on a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/5219198.stm|title=Defender Bamba joins Dunfermline|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 July 2008 | date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Leishman]] later revealed that he had been intending to bring over another player from France on trial, but this deal fell through and Bamba's agent sent him instead.&lt;ref name = "leishman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/leishman-believes-bamba-can-use-world-cup-finals-as-a-springboard-1-807389 |title=Leishman believes Bamba can use World Cup finals as a springboard |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2010 |last=Collin |first=Iain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leishman was immediately impressed by Bamba's physique and his performance as a trialist during a preseason friendly against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] striker [[John Hartson]].&lt;ref name = "leishman"/&gt; He made his competitive debut for the club in Dunfermline's opening league match of the season, a 2–1 defeat to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5223922.stm |title=Dunfermline Athletic 1–2 Hearts |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2006, Bamba was [[Ejection (sports)#Association football|sent off]] for the first time in his professional career after pushing [[Steven Naismith]] in the chest during a 5–1 defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/6196924.stm |title=Kilmarnock 5–1 Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at the club, Bamba was part of the squad that reached the [[2007 Scottish Cup Final]] and played in a 1–0 defeat to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/6684941.stm |title=Dunfermline 0–1 Celtic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club also suffered [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the Scottish Premier League after a seven-year spell in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/6645249.stm |title=Inverness CT 2–1 Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamba signed a two-year contract extension at the start of the [[2007–08 in Scottish football|2007–08 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/6967126.stm|title=Bamba signs a new deal with Pars|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 July 2008 | date=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension brought an end to rumours of his desire to leave the club in order to play at a higher level and further his chances of breaking into the Ivory Coast national side, having not played in any of Dunfermline's preseason matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23665181.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050014/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23665181.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=No offers for Bamba leaves Kenny uncertain over defender's future |newspaper=The Herald |date=23 July 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamba was allowed to go on trial with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in July 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watford.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=116592|title=La Bamba – Watford trial Pars soul|publisher=vitalfootball.co.uk|accessdate=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in a friendly for them against [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1349098,00.html|title=Boreham Wood 1 Watford 3|publisher=watfordfc.co.uk|accessdate=23 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919095755/http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10400~1349098%2C00.html|archivedate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, manager [[Jim McIntyre (footballer)|Jim McIntyre]] said he expected a fee to be agreed between Dunfermline and Watford, which would allow Bamba to move to the Championship side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/7526579.stm|title=Watford close in on Pars' Bamba|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 July 2008 |date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was thought to be almost complete, with Watford sending a doctor to China, where Bamba had travelled with the Ivory Coast Olympic squad, to conduct his medical.&lt;ref name="dreams"/&gt; However, Watford later pulled out for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer/08/08/21/manual_174324.html&amp;TEAMHD=nationwide1|title=Hornets pull out of Bamba deal|publisher=sportinglife.com|accessdate=22 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67H6pYljo?url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer%2F08%2F08%2F21%2Fmanual_174324.html&amp;TEAMHD=nationwide1|archivedate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Dunfermline accepted offers of [[Pound sterling|£]]50,000 for Bamba to move to either [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], keeping him in the Scottish Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/09/01/sportstory11897027t0.asp |title=Bamba on his way back to the SPL |work=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Dey |first=Graeme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67H6qZXUP?url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/09/01/sportstory11897027t0.asp |archivedate=29 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hibernian===
Bamba chose to move to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], signing a three-year contract with the club.&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/7591944.stm|title=Hibs sign Bamba from Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the transfer deal, Dunfermline were due 10% of any future transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27610019.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050026/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27610019.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Bamba's move to Leicester earns Dunfermline £25,000 |newspaper=The Herald |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off on his debut for a second bookable offence against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], but Bamba subsequently established himself in the Hibs first team. Despite being a natural centre back, [[manager (association football)|manager]] [[Mixu Paatelainen]] praised Bamba's performance as a [[defensive midfielder]] during a 2–0 win over Celtic in December 2008.&lt;ref name = "Mixu"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paterson |first=Colleen |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Hibs-boss-praises-Bamba-for.4773769.jp |title=Hibs boss praises Bamba for his commitment |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=9 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617043544/http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Hibs-boss-praises-Bamba-for.4773769.jp |archivedate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paatelainen commented further that he believed Bamba had improved as a player since his spell at Dunfermline, with him no longer going to ground when making a challenge,&lt;ref name = "p&amp;j"/&gt; and described him as possessing "tremendous pace and physical presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17108259.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822045951/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17108259.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Riordan reunited with his first love |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 September 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamba quickly became a popular player with the Hibs support due to his tough and committed tackling in this new role.&lt;ref name = "p&amp;j"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1000521?UserKey= |title=Powerful Bamba has made his presence felt at Easter Road |work=[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]] |location=Aberdeen |date=23 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072357/http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1000521?UserKey= |archivedate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Paatelainen's departure, new manager [[John Hughes (footballer born 1964)|John Hughes]] moved Bamba back to a central defensive role after the departure of [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1979)|Rob Jones]] in the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hibshistoricaltrust.org.uk/defenders/souleymane-bamba |title=Souleymane Bamba |publisher=Hibernian Historical Trust |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second match in this position, Bamba scored his first ever professional goal in a 3–1 win against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] on 22 August, heading in from a [[John Rankin (footballer)|John Rankin]] corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Falkirk 1–3 Hibernian| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8210716.stm| publisher  = BBC Sport| date = 22 August 2009

Bamba was called up to the squad for 10 September 2014 fixture against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], however on 29 December 2014 he was a surprising omission from the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations squads#Ivory Coast|Ivory Coast squad]] for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30625350 |title=2015 Nations Cup: Kolo Toure in squad for last time|publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has not retired from international football, he has not appeared for the side since 2014.&lt;ref name="nft"/&gt;

==Style of play==
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quoted=1|quote=I love defending. Absolutely love it. When I go into a game I set myself a target: I don’t want to lose a header anywhere on the pitch. Sometimes I see defenders and I ask myself: ‘Does he actually like defending?’ But I love going into a tackle, winning a challenge or a header. That’s why it’s good here because the fans appreciate that. In France or in Italy, when you do a good defensive tackle, they’re not bothered. But here they like that and that makes me want to defend even more.|source=—Bamba on the art of defending, 2018&lt;ref name = "Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title= Sol Bamba: ‘The gaffer always reminds me not to be Beckenbauer’|first=Stuart|last=James|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/31/sol-bamba-love-tackle-cardiff-neil-warnock}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Chiefly a centre-back, Bamba played as a defensive midfielder during his emergence at Paris SG, before becoming a centre-back at age 15.&lt;ref name="regret" /&gt; He has sporadically played in the midfield since then, most successfully for Mixu Paatelainen at Hibs.&lt;ref name="Mixu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="p&amp;j" /&gt;

Jim Leishman, who signed Bamba at Dunfermline Athletic, said of his former charge in 2010: "He's certainly got the physique and he's got the potential to do it. But potential sometimes passes you by, it's all about going out and doing it. He's a great runner, he's as strong as an ox, and he's a strong tackler."&lt;ref name="leishman" /&gt; ''[[Sky Sports]]''' Soriebah Kajue in September 2011 said Bamba "established himself as a rock at the heart of the Foxes defence and has produced a level of consistency this year that has simply been outstanding", paying tribute to "Bamba's burgeoning reputation as a ball-playing defender".&lt;ref name="Beckenbamba" /&gt;

Sven-Göran Eriksson, who managed Bamba at club level for Leicester City and internationally for the Ivory Coast, compared the defender with Franz Beckenbauer.&lt;ref name="Beckenbamba" /&gt; Cardiff manager Neil Warnock regularly told Bamba "Don’t be Beckenbauer. Just kick or head it. When it’s on, pass it, but if it’s not on, just put it up there,"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and in December 2017 Warnock branded Bamba and fellow Cardiff centre-half [[Sean Morrison (footballer)|Sean Morrison]] as better than [[Virgil van Dijk]].&lt;ref name="qa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Bamba's favourite players growing up were [[Lilian Thuram]] and [[George Weah]].&lt;ref name="regret" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bamba met his wife Chloe while playing for Leicester. They have three children together.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Bamba is [[multilingualism|multilingual]], being able to speak [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and "the [[Languages of Ivory Coast|Ivorian dialect]] that his father used at home".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Westminster]], London,&lt;ref name="Hugman2010–11 188" /&gt; Harris once held the record for the youngest player ever to appear for Wycombe in the [[Football League]], breaking [[Ikechi Anya]]'s record set in 2004 by coming on as a substitute for the final 12 minutes against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in December 2009, aged 16 years and 201 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10430~1915891,00.html|title=HARRIS: "I'M OVER THE MOON"|last=|first=|date=29 December 2009|work=|access-date=13 April 2011|publisher=Wycombe Wanderers F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2012, Harris signed for [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a three-and-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="JoinsCardiff"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cardiffcity.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2593968,00.html |title=Kadeem Harris joins Cardiff City |date=30 January 2012 |access-date=30 January 2012 |publisher=Cardiff City F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maiden call up to the first team came in a 3–1 league defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 4 February 2012, when he was an unused substitute.&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1112"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2011 |title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC |website=www.espnfc.com |access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unused substitute on a further three occasions during the [[2011–12 Cardiff City F.C. season|2011–12]] season and was not called into the squad for the [[2012 Football League play-offs#Championship|playoffs]] or the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|2012 League Cup final]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1112" /&gt; Harris was only called into the first team squad on one occasion during the [[2012–13 Cardiff City F.C. season|2012–13]] Championship-winning season, when he made his debut in a 2–1 [[FA Cup]] third round defeat against [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] on 5 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2012|title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC|website=www.espnfc.com|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris started the match and was substituted for [[Tommy O'Sullivan]] after 64 minutes.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2012/2013" /&gt; Harris received his first call into the first team squad of the [[2013–14 Cardiff City F.C. season|2013–14]] season on 28 August 2013, when he was an unused substitute for a 2–0 League Cup first round win over [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1314"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2013 |title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC |website=www.espnfc.com |access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again an unused substitute in the following round, which saw Cardiff lose 3–2 to fellow Premier League side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1314" /&gt;

====Loans Spells====
After putting in an "outstanding" performance for Cardiff in a [[Professional Development League]] game versus [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-ds-v-brentford-ds-14.10.13-1112867.aspx|title=CARDIFF CITY DS 3 BRENTFORD DS 1|author=Chris Wickham|work=brentfordfc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 October 2013 Harris joined the [[League One]] side on a loan running until 5 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24581153|title=Kadeem Harris: Brentford sign Cardiff winger on loan|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was included in the squad to face [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and after replacing [[Will Grigg]] on 65 minutes, he scored the first senior goal of his career in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harris scored his second Brentford goal in an FA Cup first round tie against local neighbours [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] on 9 November, scoring the second in a 5–0 victory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harris was stretchered off with a hamstring problem in a 3–0 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 21 December, casting doubt on his loan being extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/on-loan-cardiff-city-winger-suffers-6439041|title=On-loan Cardiff City winger suffers injury blow against Preston|author=Matt Lewis|date=21 December 2013|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December it was reported that Harris would be out for a month, with manager [[Mark Warburton]] keen on extending the loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bees-plan-extend-loan-injured-6447109|title=Bees plan to extend the loan of injured Cardiff City youngster|author=Jacob Murtagh|date=26 December 2013|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris [[Twitter|tweeted]] on 29 December that he would be returning to Cardiff, leaving plans to extend his loan up in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KadeemHarris27/status/417359585759199232|title=Kads|work=Twitter|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris made 11 appearances for Brentford and scored two goals.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=52670 |title=Kadeem Harris – Football Stats – Cardiff City – Age 22 – Soccer Base |website=soccerbase.com |access-date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in mid-March 2014 that Harris was close to a return to the Bees to cover for the injured [[Sam Saunders (footballer)|Sam Saunders]], despite being sidelined with an ankle injury himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/brentford-ponder-swoop-cardiff-city-6803302|title=Brentford ponder swoop for Cardiff City winger|author=Jacob Murtagh|date=12 March 2014|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Harris started to become a regular under new manager, [[Russell Slade]], who was appointed in October.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt; He played his first league game for Cardiff in a 5–3 loss to [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], on 20 December.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt; Harris scored his first goal for ''The Bluebirds'' in a [[FA Cup]] win against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], following this with his first league goal against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt;

On 22 August 2015, Harris joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on loan until 21 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Loan Deal: Harris links up with Tykes|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/loan-deal-harris-links-up-with-tykes-2638055.aspx|publisher=Cardiff City|date=22 August 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a goalless draw against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and went onto make 14 appearances for Barnsley before returning to Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1516" /&gt;

===Return to first team===
In August 2016, Harris received a lot of praise from Cardiff fans and manager, [[Paul Trollope]], after his performances against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in an unusual [[right wing back]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Kadeem Harris has played his way into contention for a starting spot as Cardiff City youngsters lead the way |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kadeem-harris-played-way-contention-11779342 |work=South Wales Echo |first=Phil |last=Smith |date=21 August 2016 |accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris continued to impress under new manager, [[Neil Warnock]] and eventually found his first goal on 14 January, scoring in the [[Severnside derby]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1617" /&gt; He followed this by scoring two to help Cardiff come back from 2 goals down to beat [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], 4–3, before scoring his third in two games against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1617" /&gt;

His performance throughout the season saw Harris gifted the number 11 shirt for the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2017/18 Squad Numbers Confirmed! |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/august/201718-squad-numbers-confirmed/ |publisher=Cardiff City Official Site |date=2 August 2017 |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an ankle injury suffered during pre-season ruled him out for 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kadeem Harris sidelined for up to three months with Cardiff City star needing ankle surgery |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kadeem-harris-sidelined-up-three-13431376 |work=South Wales Echo |date=4 August 2017 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several games for the under-23 side, Harris eventually made his return to the first team in a 0–0 draw at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], replacing [[Junior Hoilett]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1718" /&gt;

Harris scored his first goal since returning from injury in the [[2018–19 Cardiff City F.C. season|2018–19 season]], in a 4–2 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the [[Premier League]], Cardiff's first win of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–2 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45847412 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse''' (born 18 April 1990) is a Senegalese professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]]. 

Niasse has played top-flight football in Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Russia and England. He won the 2011 [[Senegal Premier League]] with [[US Ouakam|Ouakam]] and scored in [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]'s win in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final]]. He signed for Everton for a £13.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee in 2016. Niasse made his full international debut for Senegal in 2013.

==Club career==
===Ouakam===
Born in [[Ouakam]], [[Dakar Department]], Niasse began his football career with hometown club [[US Ouakam]] in the second tier. He signed his first professional contract with Ouakam in 2008 and in the 2008–09 season helped his team win the Second League title by scoring 21 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2014/01/09/gol-silahi-oumar-niasse-350690|title=Gol silahı Oumar Niasse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing as a winger, Niasse also played a key role in Ouakam winning the [[Senegal Premier League]] title in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oumar Niasse: Meet the hard-working Senegalese striker wanted in England|url = http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/oumar-niasse-meet-hard-working-senegalese-striker-wanted-england#:0solhCmynml5YA|website = FourFourTwo|accessdate = 2 February 2016|date = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niasse started a trial with Norwegian club [[SK Brann|Brann]] in February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ba.no/sport/fotball/brann/article5907691.ece Han kan være Branns nye kantspiller] ba.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after impressing signed for the club on a six-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece Doddo-bloggen: Signér Niasse!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212095503/http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece |date=12 February 2012 }} aftenposten.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ – Er her for å bli bedre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120223060545/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ |date=23 February 2012 }} brann.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Norway was hampered by poor form and injuries, and he returned to Senegal after playing just three [[Tippeligaen]] matches.

===Akhisar Belediyespor===
After a trial period with French club [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]], Niasse was offered a contract to join the club but refused the offer.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} He joined the summer camp of Turkish [[Süper Lig]] club [[Akhisar Belediyespor]] and signed permanently with them in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yazete.com/spor/akhisarda-oumar-niasse-de-tamam-660796.html|title=Akhisar'da Oumar Niasse de tamam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2013/08/08/akhisara-senegalli-328718|title=Akhisar'a Senegalli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse scored on his debut in Turkey and ultimately finished the season with 15 goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Lokomotiv Moscow===
[[File:Loco-Terec (4).jpg|thumb|Niasse in action for Lokomotiv against [[FC Akhmat Grozny|Terek Grozny]] in October 2014]]
Before the 2014–15 season, Niasse signed with Russian club [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] in July 2014 for a €5.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref name="sway" /&gt;  He scored Lokomotiv's equalising goal in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final|Russian Cup Final]] against [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] on 21 May 2015 as his side went on to win 3–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/05/21/russia/cup/fk-lokomotiv-moscow/fc-kuban-krasnodar/2031399/ |accessdate=12 January 2016 |title=Lokomotiv Moskva vs. Kuban' Krasnodar 3 – 1 |website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Niasse joined English [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 February 2016 for a transfer fee of approximately £13.5&amp;nbsp;million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Everton F.C.]]|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/02/01/niasse-completes-13-5-move|title=Niasse Completes £13.5m Move|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/oumar-niasse-everton-lokomotiv-moscow-premier-league|title=Everton poised to sign Lokomotiv Moscow's Oumar Niasse for £13.5m|first=David|last=Hytner|date=30 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] on 20 February 2016, entering as an 80th-minute substitute for striker [[Romelu Lukaku]]. 

After 152 minutes of football in his first season at the club, Niasse was not given a squad number for the following 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/03/premier-league-2016-17-preview-everton|title=Premier League 2016–17 Preview Everton|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was informed by then-Everton manager [[Ronald Koeman]] he would need to search for a new club during the summer 2016 transfer window, saying, "[I]f Niasse likes to play football he needs to leave Everton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bascombe|first1=Chris|title=Everton manager Ronald Koeman tells Oumar Niasse to find another club – just six months after his arrival|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/18/everton-manager-ronald-koeman-tells-oumar-niasse-to-find-another/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, following the close of the transfer deadline for loaning and signing players in England, he was listed as part of the 25-man Everton squad for the 2016–17 season submitted on 1 September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Ian|title=Oumar Niasse included in Everton's Premier League squad|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/oumar-niasse-included-evertons-premier-11831437|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually issued squad number 24. 

In October 2016, Niasse was demoted to the under-23 squad and had his personal locker revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez|title=Everton’s Oumar Niasse: ‘It’s really sad.

====Loan to Hull City====
On 13 January 2017, Niasse signed a loan contract with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until the end of the 2016–17 season with an option for a £10&amp;nbsp;million permanent transfer from Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =David|last=Anderson |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-flop-oumar-niasse-joins-9615346|title=Everton flop Oumar Niasse joins Hull on loan with view to permanent £10m switch |date=13 January 2017 |newspaper=The Mirror|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull City sign Oumar Niasse on loan and Evandro for undisclosed fee |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38611524 |newspaper=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut the next day as an 83rd-minute substitute for [[Abel Hernández]] in a 3–1 home win against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38539371  | title = Hull City 3–1 Bournemouth | date = 14 January 2017 | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for Hull and in English football came on 26 January in the [[EFL Cup]] semi-final second leg against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he made his first start for the club.

====Return to Everton====
After returning to Everton, Niasse made his first appearance since his return as a substitute in the [[2017–18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] third round match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 20 September 2017, scoring Everton's third goal of a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249724|title= Everton 3–0 Sunderland|accessdate = 21 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Ronald Koeman named Niasse in Everton's 25-man Premier League squad upon his return from loan and consequently issued him a squad number. However, Koeman omitted Niasse from Everton's [[UEFA Europa League]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/everton-ronald-koeman-europa-league|title=Everton’s Koeman has no regrets over Oumar Niasse’s Europa League snub|work=The Guardian|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September, Niasse scored two goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–1 Premier League win, helping Everton to come back from a goal down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41290322|title= Everton 2–1 Bournemouth|accessdate = 23 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November, Niasse scored Everton's first goal in a 3–2 home win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], having been losing 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41792811|title=Everton 3–2 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, he scored in a 2–2 draw away to bottom side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41951923|title=Crystal Palace 2–2 Everton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse sparked controversy in the match by appearing to dive to win Everton a penalty, which was converted by [[Leighton Baines]] to make the score 1–1 in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/oumar-niasse-facing-retrospective-diving-ban-after-winning-contentious-penalty-at-crystal-palace-a3695611.html|title=Oumar Niasse facing retrospective diving ban after winning contentious penalty at Crystal Palace|work=London Evening Standard|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became the first Premier League player to be charged with "successful deception of a match official" under [[The Football Association]]'s new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42066734|title=Oumar Niasse: Everton striker charged for dive against Crystal Palace|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton appealed the verdict, but the FA rejected the appeal and Niasse received a two-match suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11138846/evertons-oumar-niasse-has-appeal-to-simulation-ban-rejected-by-fa|title=Niasse given two-match ban for diving|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 November 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 28 January 2013, he signed for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City sign Connah's Quay Nomads striker Rhys Healey|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/21185153|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 he signed a new contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City starlet Rhys Healey agrees new contract at the club|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11704/9212391/transfer-news-cardiff-city-starlet-rhys-healey-agrees-new-contract-at-the-club|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2014, he made his first-team debut, on the last day of the season, in a 2–1 defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as a substitute in place of [[Craig Bellamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff 1–2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27273463|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2015, Healey signed for [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on loan until January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHYS SIGNS ON LOAN|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/rhys-signs-on-loan|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=1 September 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of 7 appearances for the club, scoring once during a 2–1 defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], before his loan spell was ended early following an injury.

On 31 August 2016, Healey joined Newport County on loan until 3 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/14715569.Cardiff_City_starlet_signs_for_Newport_County/ |title=Cardiff City starlet signs for Newport County |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Newport on 10 September 2016 in [[Football League Two|League Two]] during a 2–2 draw with [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] as a second-half substitute in place of [[Jon Parkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37263649 |title=Newport 2–2 Cheltenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2016 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Newport on 24 September 2016 in a 2–1 defeat to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37394542 |title=Newport County 1–2 Cambridge United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Cardiff at the end of his loan spell, making his final appearance for Newport in a 2–1 defeat to [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 2 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/football/newportcounty/14998917.Newport_County_boss_targets_defenders_ahead_of_Saturday/ |title=Graham Westley expects more new arrivals before Stevenage trip |publisher=South Wales Argus |first=Andrew |last=Penman |date=3 January 2017 |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon on returning, Healey found himself placed on the bench for Cardiff City for the first time in 3 years against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

'''David Wayne "Junior" Hoilett''' (born 5 June 1990) is a Canadian professional [[association football]] player who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[CMNT|Canadian national team]].

He signed for English club [[Blackburn Rovers]] at the age of 13, and was loaned to [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]] and [[FC St. Pauli]] in the German [[2. Bundesliga]]. He made his Rovers debut in 2009 and played three full [[Premier League]] seasons for them before a transfer to [[Queens Park Rangers]]. Hoilett spent four years at the [[Loftus Road]] club – alternately in the Premier League and [[EFL Championship|Championship]] – before moving to Cardiff on the expiration of his contract.

Hoilett made his senior international debut for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in 2015. He was part of their squad at the [[2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

==Club career==

===Blackburn Rovers Academy===
Hoilett was born in [[Brampton]], [[Ontario]], and played several sports as a child before settling on football at age 11.&lt;ref name=lancs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cryer |first1=Andy |title=Hoilett: I've made it at Blackburn Rovers the hard way |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/5046588.hoilett-ive-made-it-at-blackburn-rovers-the-hard-way/ |accessdate=22 January 2019 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he travelled the world with his club and gained attention at a tournament in Wales; he turned down [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] as he believed he had more chance of breaking into the first team at the latter.&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt; After moving to England, he attended [[St Bede's Roman Catholic High School, Blackburn|St Bede's Roman Catholic High School]] in [[Blackburn]].&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier League Under 16 Schools’ Cup for Girls’ Final |url=http://www.esfa.co.uk/news/?2015/04/28/094110/premier-league-under-16-schools-cup-for-girls-final |accessdate=22 January 2019 |publisher=English Schools Football Association |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was initially unable to earn a work permit to play in the United Kingdom, Blackburn loaned him to German clubs to help him earn one in the future.&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;

====SC Paderborn (loan)====
Hoilett made his debut for [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]] (on [[loan (sports)|loan]]) against [[Kickers Offenbach]], coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Sven Lintjens]] in a 3–2 victory on 3 February 2008, aged 17.&lt;ref name="Zwei Aussetzer in der Defensive"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate =27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoilett's first match in the starting eleven was against [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]] on 9 March 2008.&lt;ref name="Beste Torchancen vergeben"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beste Torchancen vergeben |url=http://www.scpaderborn07.de/scpaderborn07/38-Saison/3820,Beste-Torchancen-vergeben.html |language=German |publisher=SC Paderborn |date= |accessdate=27 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719083808/http://www.scpaderborn07.de/scpaderborn07/38-Saison/3820%2CBeste-Torchancen-vergeben.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett scored his only goal of his loan campaign on 18 May 2008 against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paderborn vs. Borussia M'gladbach  2 – 3|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2008/05/18/germany/2-bundesliga/sc-paderborn-07-ev/borussia-monchengladbach/470135/|publisher=SoccerWay.com|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what would be his final game for the club.

Paderborn were later relegated, ending the [[2007–08 2. Bundesliga]] season in 17th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 2007/08|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit08.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FC St. Pauli (loan)====
Hoilett was loaned to another German club in the [[2. Bundesliga]], [[FC St. Pauli]], for the [[2008–09 2. Bundesliga]] season. He made his debut for the [[Hamburg]]-based side against [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth]] on 22 August 2008. He scored six times during his loan campaign with braces against [[Alemannia Aachen]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]], as well as individual goals against [[TSV 1860 München|1860 München]] and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. His final game would come in the form of a 1–0 loss against [[Rot Weiss Ahlen]] on 3 May 2009. St. Pauli finished the season in eighth position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 2008/09|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit09.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackburn Rovers===
In January 2009, Hoilett's home club Blackburn applied for him to receive a [[work permit]] for him to play football in England.&lt;ref name="Hoilett Fight For Work Permit"&gt;{{cite news | title = Teen ace in permit fight | first = Andy | last = Cryer | url = http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/search/4427012.Teen_ace_in_permit_fight/ | publisher = Lancashire Telegraph | date = 9 June 2009 | accessdate = 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2009, Hoilett was granted a work permit on appeal, allowing him to continue his fledgling career in England at the [[Premier League]] level with Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/startseite/artikel/511053/ | title = Hoilett zurück auf der Insel | language = German | publisher = kicker.de | accessdate = 9 July 2012 | date = 6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Junior Hoilett.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hoilett before the match between Blackburn and Arsenal at Ewood Park on September 17, 2011]]

He scored his first and second goals for Blackburn since his full-time return to the club in only his third game, in a pre-season friendly against non-League club [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh Genesis]]. He also earned Rovers a penalty in that game. His first competitive goal for Rovers came in a 3–1 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 25 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett was involved in Blackburn's dramatic [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 2 December 2009. Coming on as a second half substitution, he won an extra-time penalty which [[Benni McCarthy]] converted to put Rovers 3–2 up, but then missed a golden chance late on to seal victory before [[Paulo Ferreira]] equalised in the 122nd minute. However, Hoilett converted the crucial fifth penalty to help Rovers to the 4–3 shootout win and a place in the semi-finals. He then started his first league match on 12 December 2009 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 draw at the [[KC Stadium]]. On 25 February 2010, with his contract due to expire in June 2010, Hoilett ended media speculation regarding his future at the club, by signing a new two-and-a-half year deal with Blackburn, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2012. On 9 May, he scored a header in a win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]] on the final day of the season, although the goal was later recorded as a [[Richard Dunne]] own goal. Hoilett made his first Premier League appearance of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]] on 21 August 2010 by coming on for [[Nikola Kalinić]] in the 84th minute in a 2–1 defeat at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]] against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1976874,00.html | title = Junior agrees new deal | publisher = Blackburn Rovers | date = 25 February 2010 | accessdate = 9 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329034014/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1976874,00.html | archive-date = 29 March 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the 1–0 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10303~54887,00.html |title=Junior scores 1st 2010/11 season goal vs QPR |publisher=Blackburn Rovers |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014225535/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10303~54887%2C00.html |archivedate=14 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett scored his first league goal on 23 January 2011 in a 2–0 home victory against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Ewood Park]], converting in the 47th minute from a Nikola Kalinić assist. On 12 February 2011, he made his 40th Premier League appearance for Blackburn when he featured against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at Ewood Park in a goalless draw, and was replaced at half-time due to a slight hamstring strain by [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]]. On 5 March, he scored his third goal of the season in a 3–2 defeat against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the 65th minute, away at [[Craven Cottage]]. He replaced by debutant [[Rubén Rochina]] on 82 minutes. His next goal came in the following game, a last gasp equaliser coming from a header against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at Ewood Park in a 2–2 draw. On 9 April 2011, he scored in the 1–1 draw versus Birmingham City at Ewood Park on half-time, but he unfortunately got injured in the 68th minute, being replaced by Australian [[Brett Emerton]].

He scored his fifth league goal of the season with an individual goal, in a 3–2 win against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at [[Molineux Stadium]] on the last day of the season. On 11 September 2011, in a game between Blackburn and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], he was involved in a collision with [[Mark Schwarzer]] which resulted a head injury for Hoilett. He was eventually stretched off and Schwarzer received a yellow card.
Hoilett scored a controversial second's goal in a match as Blackburn drew with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 3–3 after teammate Morten Gamst Pedersen seemed to dribble the ball straight from a corner before firing in a low cross for Hoilett to head home from two yards.&lt;ref name="3 Wigan–3 Blackburn"&gt;{{cite news

In January 2012, Hoilett was named one of the 13 players to watch in 2012 by world football governing body [[FIFA]].&lt;ref name="fifa-2012-01-13"&gt;{{cite news

On 9 July 2007 Arsenal announced he would be spending the whole of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08]] season on loan to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/matthew-connolly-joins-colchester-on-loan | title=Matthew Connolly joins Colchester United on loan | publisher=Arsenal F.C. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135454/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/matthew-connolly-joins-colchester-on-loan | archivedate=5 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he eventually was recalled midway through the loan on 2 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/colchester_united/7165220.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Colchester to lose on-loan Gunner | date=30 December 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queens Park Rangers===
The same day, his transfer to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] was announced, after a lack of first-team opportunities were offered by Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11711/3015996/connolly-links-up-with-qpr | work=Sky Sports | title=Sky Sports – Football – Premier League – News – Connolly links up with QPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut came on 5 January, in a 1–0 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[FA Cup]].

|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the meantime, in November, he received his first call-up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U-21 squad]], where he joined Arsenal teammate [[Theo Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/reserves-news/matt-connolly-called-up-for-under-21-action|title=Matt Connolly called up for Under-21 action|website=Arsenal.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070434/http://www.arsenal.com/news/reserves-news/matt-connolly-called-up-for-under-21-action|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came on 6 March against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in a 3–1 win.

During the 2010–11 season, Connolly played a part in QPR's Championship title win playing 36 out of 43 games.

He joined Reading on a loan on 31 January 2012 until the end of the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading sign QPR defender Matthew Connolly on loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16812181.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royals swoop for Matthew Connolly |url=http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~2594815,00.html |publisher=Reading Football Club |accessdate=31 January 2012 |date=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418043507/http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10306~2594815%2C00.html |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 11 February 2012 in a 2–0 win against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. He only played 6 times during Reading's promotion push which resulted in Reading winning the Championship title.

===Cardiff City===
[[File:Matthew Connolly.jpg|thumb|upright|Connolly playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2012]]

On 20 August 2012, QPR had accepted a £500,000 bid from [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for Connolly's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City close to signing QPR defender Matthew Connolly |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-close-signing-qpr-2026055 |work=South Wales Echo |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, the deal was completed and Connolly signed a contract that would keep him at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DEAL DONE: CONNOLLY SIGNS FOR CITY |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2896709,00.html |work=Cardiff City FC |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824211423/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2896709%2C00.html |archivedate=24 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the [[Severnside derby]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 25 August. He scored his first and second goal for the club in a 3–0 win over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 29 September. His third goal came a month later against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and later scored his fourth against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Making thirty-six appearances and scoring five goals, Connolly was a key figure as Cardiff won the [[2012-13 Football League Championship|Championship]] title, the third time in successive seasons that Connolly has achieved the feat.

[[File:Matthew Connolly 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Connolly playing for Cardiff City in 2015.]]
He started the [[Premier League]] season playing at right back until new signing [[Kevin Theophile-Catherine]] became a permanent fixture in the side. Cardiff were relegated after just one season in the top flight. Connolly had then returned to the starting eleven partnering [[Mark Hudson (footballer, born 1982)|Mark Hudson]] in a 1–1 draw at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn Rovers 1–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28646428 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2014 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2015 Connolly joined another Championship side, [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], on loan until the end of the [[2014–15 in English football|2014–15 season]], despite having played 26 times for Cardiff that season. Manager [[Russell Slade]] stated the deal was a business rather than a footballing decision, with Connolly expressing his surprise at the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Connolly says the Watford squad is more talented than the QPR, Reading and Cardiff City sides he was promoted to the Premier League with |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/12869600.Connolly__Talent_in_Watford_squad_is_better_than_teams_I_ve_been_promoted_with/ |work=Watford Observer |date=6 April 2015 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst at Watford, Connolly achieved the feat of being promoted to the [[Premier League]] for the fourth time with four different clubs (QPR, Reading, Cardiff and Watford). At Watford Connolly scored once; in a 3–1 win at Nottingham Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Nottm Forest 1–3 Watford
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]
|date=15 April 2015
|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connolly rejoined the Cardiff squad for the [[2015–16 Cardiff City F.C. season|2015–16 season]], earning himself a permanent place in the side alongside [[Sean Morrison (footballer)|Sean Morrison]]. He had become of interest to other clubs during the January transfer window, due to his impressive performances that season. These feats thus earned him a contract extension till 2019 and also the club's Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Connolly signs long-term deal |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/connolly-signs-long-term-city-deal-2908639.aspx |work=Cardiff City F.C. |publisher=Official Site |date=19 January 2016  |accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Player &gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City end of season awards RECAP: Matt Connolly named Player of the Year |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-end-season-awards-11299527 |work=Wales Online |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he later signed a youth deal with their [[East Anglian derby|East Anglian]] rivals [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], joining the club at the age of nine and playing alongside [[Jordan Rhodes]] and [[Ed Upson]] in the academy during his time at the club.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; However, he failed to make an appearance for the first team and was released at the end of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]] after Ipswich decided against offering him a scholarship,&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt; believing that he would be unable to compete physically at under-18 level.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; O'Keefe later commented on his release "It was disappointing to be released by Ipswich, especially since I had been there from such a young age, but I always kept believing in myself".&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt;

Following his release, O'Keefe spent one month on trial at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and impressed the club's coaching staff, including youth coach [[Gordon Cowans]],&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; but was forced to leave the club, who were only willing to offer him a one-year youth contract,&lt;ref name="Showdown"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/4724131.O_Keefe_set_for_Gills_showdown/ |title=O'Keefe set for Gills showdown |newspaper=Southend Echo |first=Chris |last=Phillips |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after struggling to travel to the Midlands-based club on a regular basis as he continued to prepare for his GCSEs. He was also offered a trial with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],&lt;ref name="Prideofanglia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=playerProfile&amp;fullname=Stuart%20OKeefe |title=Stuart O'Keefe |publisher=Pride of Anglia |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring during a friendly match for the club but O'Keefe again moved on after Forest stalled over offering him a contract as they were only willing to offer him a one-year youth deal.&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Showdown"/&gt;

===Southend United===
O'Keefe attended a trial with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in November 2007 at the age of 16, having been recommended to the club by a scout working for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and was offered a two-year scholarship just days after arriving at the club.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; In his first season with the academy, O'Keefe was part of the Southend team that reached the quarter-final of the [[FA Youth Cup]] and also featured for the reserves on several occasions.&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt; O'Keefe made his first-team debut for Southend on 18 November 2008, at home to [[A.F.C.
