Ryan played for the Central Coast Mariners youth team in the [[2009–10 Central Coast Mariners FC season|2009–10 season]], and after several call-ups to the senior team, he was given a 3-year senior contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goalweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=663:ryan-playing-for-keeps&amp;catid=61:central-coast-mariners-fc&amp;Itemid=87 |title=Ryan playing for keeps |date=11 February 2010 |publisher=goalweekly.com |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite starting the [[2010–11 A-League]] as the Mariners' substitute keeper, an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]] to first-choice [[Jess Vanstrattan]] saw Ryan elevated into the starting eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com.au/news/vanstrattan-out-for-a-year-230195 |title=Vanstrattan out for a year |website=FourFourTwo |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made his [[A-League]] debut for the Mariners on 28 August 2010 in a 1–1 draw against [[Sydney FC]], but fumbled a cross which allowed [[Rhyan Grant]] to score Sydney's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-28/mariners-steal-draw-against-sky-blues/961514 |title=Mariners steal draw against Sky Blues |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=27 September 2017 |date=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While coach [[Graham Arnold]] was happy with Ryan's debut, there was competition between Ryan and newly-signed [[Paul Henderson (footballer)|Paul Henderson]] for the regular starting spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportalnz.gearbox.performgroup.com/football/news/mariners'-gk-quandry/1966dsahf2i6k19b1f06o24usb |title=Mariners' GK quandry |publisher=Sportal |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several months Ryan retained his spot in the starting lineup and earned significant plaudits, including the A-League Young Player of the Month award for December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/ten-clean-sheets-and-an-official-rap-give-ryan-cup-legup-20110110-19l6y |title=Ten clean sheets and an official rap give Ryan Cup leg-up |author=Hassett, Sebastian |date=11 January 2011 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mariners season ended with a penalty shootout loss to [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]] in the [[2011 A-League Grand Final]], however, Ryan was awarded the [[Joe Marston Medal]] for man of the match in that game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-sport/roar-grab-aleague-title-with-dramatic-win-20110313-1bss6.html |title=Roar grab A-League title with dramatic win |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Clark, Laine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named [[A-League Young Footballer of the Year]] for 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2011/03/06/flores-takes-top-gong |website=The World Game |date=6 March 2011 |title=Flores takes top gong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2015, Ryan signed a six-year deal with [[La Liga]] side [[Valencia CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.valenciacf.com/ver/42131/vcf-official-statement-.html |title=VCF Official Statement |publisher=Valencia's official website |date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was expected to assume the starting goalkeeper role, at least in the medium term, with regular starter [[Diego Alves]] out with an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/07/22/socceroos-star-ryan-signs-six-year-valencia-deal |title=Socceroos star Ryan signs six-year Valencia deal |website=The World Game |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his unofficial debut in a friendly against [[PSV Eindhoven]] on 25 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the-afc.com/australia-asian-cup-2019-2018-world-cup/ryan-makes-impressive-valencia-debut-in-win-over-psv |title=Ryan makes impressive Valencia debut in win over PSV Eindhoven |publisher=Asian Football Confederation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2015, Ryan made his [[La Liga]] debut in Valencia's opening game of the season, keeping a clean sheet in a scoreless draw with [[Rayo Vallecano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/08/23/ryan-keeps-clean-sheet-la-liga-debut |title=Ryan keeps clean sheet on La Liga debut |website=The World Game |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His run in the starting side extended until September, when he sustained a [[tear of meniscus|meniscus tear]] in a draw with [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], forcing him to have surgery and miss over a month of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/valencia/story/2591786/valencia-goalkeeper-mathew-ryan-sidelined-with-knee-injury |author=Garcia, Adriana |website=ESPN FC |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |title=Mathew Ryan out for Valencia with knee injury after surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of good performances from his replacement, [[Jaume Domènech]], led to suggestions that Ryan would not return to the starting side after his return from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/can-mat-ryan-displace-form-spaniard-valencia |title=Can Mat Ryan displace in-form Spaniard at Valencia? |publisher=Football Federation Australia |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Greco, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not until late November that Ryan was re-promoted to the starting side for a game against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deportevalenciano.com/2015/11/29/nuno-sienta-jaume-coloca-ryan-titular-sevilla |language=Spanish |title=Nuno sienta a Jaume y coloca a Ryan como titular ante el Sevilla |author=Ballester, Nacho|trans-title=Nuno benches Jaume and makes Ryan the starter against Sevilla |publisher=Deporte Valenciano |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan continued to be rotated with Jaume and the returning Alves for the remainder of the season, eventually making 21 appearances for Valencia in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/socceroos-goalkeeper-mat-ryan-opens-up-about-his-rollercoaster-year-with-spanish-giant-valencia/news-story/ae2b41b77f7e0ac0aed9803d67b75e9a |title=Socceroos goalkeeper Mat Ryan opens up about his rollercoaster year with Spanish giant Valencia |author=Davutovic, David |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was back in Valencia's starting lineup for the opening matches of the [[2016–17 La Liga]], with Alves rumored to be seeking an overseas move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/08/28/ryan-impresses-valencia-go-down |title=Ryan impresses but Valencia go down |website=The World Game |date=28 August 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alves stayed at Valencia and Ryan subsequently lost his starting position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/11/13/ryan-considering-valencia-options |title=Ryan considering Valencia options |website=The World Game |date=13 November 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2017, a number of clubs were interested in Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/11/13/ryan-considering-valencia-options |title=Ryan considering Valencia options |publisher=Goal.com |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Huguenin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Racing Genk====
On 30 January 2017, Ryan returned to Belgium after he was loaned to [[K.R.C. Genk|Racing Genk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/01/30/ryan-leaves-valencia-genk |title=Ryan leaves Valencia for Genk |first=Dave |last=Lewis |website=The World Game |publisher=Special Broadcasting Service |date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the starting squad straight away, playing his first match in a 1–0 loss to [[K.V.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 16 June 2017, it was announced that Ryan would sign for newly-promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 1 July 2017 on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/mat-ryan-joins-new-boys-brighton-and-hove-albion-on-record-fee-20170616-gwt1am.html |title=Mat Ryan joins new boys Brighton and Hove Albion on record fee |first=Alan |last=Baldwin |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the prospect of playing in the Premier League as a main reason for the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/07/22/ryan-reveals-why-he-traded-valencia-brighton |author=Micallef, Philip |title=Ryan reveals why he traded Valencia for Brighton |website=The World Game |date=22 July 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made his debut for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 12 August 2017 against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/match/brighton-hove-albion-v-manchester-city/90r9vov8c2la34s83h1q7lcoa |title=Brighton and Hove Albion 0 Manchester City 2: Ruthless Aguero makes the difference for Guardiola |first=Matthew |last=Scott |publisher=Goal.com |date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth===
Despite not having featured for the side previously, Ryan's strong form in the [[2010–11 A-League]] led to suggestions he would be called up for the [[Australia national under-20 soccer team|Australian under-20 team]] for the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/912187/ten-clean-sheets-and-an-official-rap-give-ryan-cup-leg-up/?cs=7 |title=Ten clean sheets and an official rap give Ryan Cup leg-up |author=Hassett, Sebastian |newspaper=Central Western Daily |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he missed the tournament after suffering a serious knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2011/07/19/ryan-back-at-training/ |title=Ryan back at training |publisher=NBN Television |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928060511/http://media.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2011/07/19/ryan-back-at-training/|archive-date=28 September 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was first called up for the [[Australia national under-23 soccer team|Australian under-23 side]] in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/mat-ryan-among-new-olyroos-faces/news-story/da19ba10a58415570dc723f1187750a8 |title=Mat Ryan among new Olyroos faces |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the side in a scoreless draw with [[Iraq national under-23 football team|Iraq]] on 22 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://under23s.footballaustralia.com.au/article/qantas-australian-under-23s-draw-with-iraq/api125f3d7b81rwl0fsf2u1sh |title=Qantas Australian Under 23s draw with Iraq |publisher=Football Federation Australia |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217194204/http://under23s.footballaustralia.com.au/article/qantas-australian-under-23s-draw-with-iraq/api125f3d7b81rwl0fsf2u1sh |archivedate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olyroos failed to qualify for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4023/other-australian-football/2012/02/23/2922948/united-arab-emirates-1-0-australia-olyroos-out-of-london |title=United Arab Emirates 1–0 Australia: Olyroos out of London 2012 Olympics |publisher=Goal.com |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |author=Higgs, Paddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
[[File:Mathew Ryan, Asian Cup 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Ryan with Australia at the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]]]]
Ryan received his first call-up to the [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] squad for a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/osieck-mixes-old-heads-new-faces/1279523/ |title=Osieck mixes old heads with new faces |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |author=Jones, Quinn |newspaper=The Northern Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was selected in the squad for the second preliminary round of the [[2013 EAFF East Asian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/osieck-finalises-east-asian-cup-squad |title=Osieck finalises East Asian Cup squad |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |publisher=Football Federation Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior international debut in a 1–1 draw with [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] on 5 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-06/socceroos-held-by-north-korea/4411612 |title=Socceroos held by North Korea |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, longtime Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] announced his international retirement following the appointment of new coach [[Ange Postecoglou]], leaving Ryan as one of the contenders to be the new first-choice keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/mark-schwarzer-retires-from-socceroos-20131105-2x06m.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 November 2013 |author=Hassett, Sebastian |accessdate=28 September 2017 |title=Mark Schwarzer retires from Socceroos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postecoglou identified Ryan and fellow young keeper [[Mitch Langerak]] as two of the main candidates for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://matildas.footballaustralia.com.au/news/ryan-langerak-leading-contenders-replace-schwarzer |title=Ryan, Langerak leading contenders to replace Schwarzer |publisher=Football Federation Australia |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was selected in May 2014 in the Australian squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/sport/alex-wilkinson-named-in-the-socceroos-final-23-man-squad-for-the-world-cup-in-brazil/news-story/e7d2f3d848a63401c5e960158d4adcc1 |title=Alex Wilkinson named in the Socceroos final 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=Sydney |author=Connellan, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in all three of Australia's games as they were eliminated in the group stage after losses to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Ryan's own performances in the tournament were mixed, and he described the matches as a "massive learning curve" for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/australia-2014/mat-ryan-admits-world-cup-has-been-a-tough-learning-ground-20140624-zsjty.html |title=Mat Ryan admits World Cup has been a tough learning ground |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Hassett, Sebastian |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, Ryan was selected for the Australian [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] squad, to be played in Australia in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2014/12/23/socceroos-squad-includes-mix-talent-asian-cup |title=Socceroos squad includes mix of talent for Asian Cup |website=The World Game |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put in a number of strong performances throughout the tournament as Australia conceded just two goals in reaching the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup Final|Final]] against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/01/29/ryan-spurred-socceroos-asian-cup-heartbreak |title=Ryan spurred on by Socceroos' Asian Cup heartbreak |website=The World Game |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia claimed their first [[AFC Asian Cup]] title after winning 2–1 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-31/australia-socceroos-win-asian-cup/6060038 |title=Asian Cup: Australia wins first title with 2–1 extra-time win over South Korea thanks to James Troisi and Massimo Luongo goals |publisher=ABC News |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was named the official Best Goalkeeper for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mundodosguardaredes.pt/mathew-ryan-vence-afc-asian-cup-2015-e/ |title=Mathew Ryan vence AFC Asian Cup 2015 e Best Goalkeeper Award pela Austrália|trans-title=Mathew Ryan wins AFC Asian Cup 2015 and Best Goalkeeper Award with Australia |publisher=MundoDosGuardaredes.pt |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Australia's 23-man [[Australia national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb |title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He previously played club football for [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[Tours FC|Tours]], [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], [[Olympiacos FC|Olympiacos]] and [[Wigan Athletic]] and represented [[France national under-21 football team|France at under-21 level]] before switching to his native Cameroon.

==Personal life==

Born in Cameroon, Bong grew up in France.

==Career==

===Early career and Valenciennes===
Bong began his career in the youth side for [[FC Metz|Metz]] and was loaned out for the 2008–09 season to [[Ligue 2]] club [[Tours FC|Tours]]. On 29 July 2009, the 21-year-old left Metz to sign a four-year deal with [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]] for £595,000, where he made 117 overall appearances for the club and scored 4 goals.

===2013–14 with Olympiacos===
On 19 of August 2013 he signed a contract with [[Olympiacos FC|Olympiacos]] for £850,000, where he played 19 games and scored 1 goal against [[Asteras Tripoli]] in the [[Greek Cup]]. Bong helped Olympiacos win their 41st [[Superleague Greece]] title this season. 
Bong also made 4 appearances in the [[UEFA Champions League]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Wigan Athletic===
On 2 February 2015, Bong signed for English club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on a short-term contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wiganathletic.com/news/2015/february/gaetan-bong-joins-wigan-athletic/ |title=Gaëtan Bong joins Wigan Athletic |publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C. |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released at the end of the season following Wigan's relegation from the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wiganathletic.com/news/2015/may/players-contracts-update/ |title=Players' contract update |publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C. |date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
====2015–16====
In June 2015, Bong joined [[EFL Championship]] side [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] on a free transfer, signing an initial two-year contract with the south coast club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33374876 |title=Gaetan Bong: Brighton sign Cameroon international left-back |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared regularly for the club until tearing his tendon in October 2015, ruling him out for 21 games throughout the season. He would only appear as a substitute for the rest of the season, making three appearances. He also played in the playoffs, as the club lost to [[Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals 3–1 on aggregate.

====2016–17====
In the 2016–17 season, Bong was again a regular for the first half of the year, however due to persistent injuries he was not included in the squad for much of the second half apart from three games: a victory against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], another against Wigan, and a loss to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Brighton finished the season as runners up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], gaining automatic promotion to the [[Premier League]].

Bong's contract was due to expire at the end of the season, however he signed a new one-year contract with the club as Brighton aim to survive their first Premier League season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2017/may/bong-signs-new-contract/|title=Bong signs new contract|first=James |last=Hilsum |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|date=30 May 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18====
Bong played two matches for Brighton in the [[EFL Cup]], the second a 1–0 away defeat against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth]]. He made his Premier League debut in a 2–0 away defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 1 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41376506|title=Arsenal 2–0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion |first=Timothy |last=Abraham |publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started for Albion in their next five league games as they embarked on an unbeaten run that saw the club reach as high as 8th place in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41964596 |title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2–2 Stoke City |first=Alex |last=Bysouth |publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, Bong was involved in an incident with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] striker [[Romelu Lukaku]] in Brighton's 1–0 league defeat at Old Trafford, where Lukaku attempted to kick Bong twice in Brighton's penalty area. Lukaku ultimately did not face retrospective action for the incident, with referee Neil Swarbrick's report confirming that he had not seen the incident, but the FA panel could not reach a unanimous verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11146659/manchester-uniteds-romelu-lukaku-facing-no-disciplinary-action-for-gaetan-bong-clash|title=Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku facing no disciplinary action for Gaetan Bong clash|publisher=Sky Sports|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bong accused [[Jay Rodriguez]] of making a racist remark during a 2–0 defeat at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 13 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/01/15/albion-defender-requests-full-investigation-of-allegations-against-west-brom-player/|title=Albion defender requests ‘full investigation’ of allegations against West Brom player|date=15 January 2018|work=Brighton and Hove News|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Brom forward was charged by the Football Association on 8 February in relation to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/feb/08/jay-rodriguez-charged-080218|title=Jay Rodriguez charged|publisher=The Football Association|date=8 February 2018|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were later found not proven by the F.A. due to lack of evidence, but the FA was "completely satisfied" Bong's complaint was "made in absolute good faith" and "there has been no suggestion that this was a malicious or fabricated complaint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Fifield| first1=Dominic|title=FA finds allegations of racial abuse by Jay Rodriguez ‘not proven’| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/jay-rodriguez-west-brom-cleared-racial-abuse|accessdate=29 April 2018|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Rodriguez: Charge of racially abusing Gaetan Bong 'not proven'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43744840|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February, Bong signed a one-year contract extension, committing him to Brighton until 30 June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/02/28/brighton-and-hove-albion-defender-signs-contract-extension/|title=Brighton and Hove Albion defender signs contract extension|last=le Duc|first=Frank|date=28 February 2018|work=Brighton and Hove News|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Bong was eligible to play for either [[France national football team|France]], where he grew up, or [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], where he was born. He played one international match for the France U21, before opting to play for Cameroon.

Bong played one match for Cameroon in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in Cameroon's last group match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], where Cameroon lost 2–1. Cameroon lost all three group games, finishing bottom of Group E of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

He came through the youth academy at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], where he completed his development after being promoted into the senior squad, spending most of his time at the club out on loan. He joined [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in 2014 for an undisclosed fee, spending two years with the Lancashire club before moving to Brighton in 2016, where he earned promotion to the Premier League.

Born in [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, Duffy played for Northern Ireland at youth international level before switching allegiance to the Republic of Ireland. He made his debut for their [[Republic of Ireland national football team|senior team]] in 2014 and represented the country at [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
As a youth, Duffy played [[Gaelic football]] for [[Doire Colmcille CLG]] and association football for Foyle Harps, both based in [[Derry]]. He represented Northern Ireland at [[Northern Ireland national under-16 football team|under 16 level]] in the 2007 [[Victory Shield]] tournament and impressed Everton manager [[David Moyes]] in a performance at [[Bloomfield Road]] against [[England national under-16 football team|England]].

Duffy joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 2008 as a first-year scholar and worked his way through the U-18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/08-09/under18.asp|title=Everton Under-18s|date=2 May 2009|work=ToffeeWeb|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reserve teams. Manager [[David Moyes]] named him and several young players in the first team for the pre-season friendlies and Duffy scored his first Everton goal against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] in a 4–0 victory. He made his professional debut versus [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in December 2009, coming on for the injured [[Sylvain Distin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=2000037/match=2000876/report=lu.html|title=Everton vs AEK Athens|date=2 December 2009|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Everton's next European fixture, Duffy made his home debut at [[Goodison Park]], completing the full 90 minutes against [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8415881.stm|title=Everton 0 – 1 BATE Borisov|date=17 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 December 2009|first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 Duffy got seriously injured after colliding with a goalkeeper during a training match.

In August 2016, during a league match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], Duffy scored 2 own goals and was later sent off in the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/17/shane-duffy-blackburn-cardiff-qpr-barnsley-championship|title=Shane Duffy bags two own-goals and sees red as Blackburn lose at Cardiff|last=Association|first=Press|date=2016-08-17|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 26 August, Duffy signed a four-year deal with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/shane-duffy-brighton-hove-albion-blackburn-rovers-3273273.aspx|title=DUFFY DEAL DONE|last=Camillin|first=Paul|date=26 August 2016|website=seagulls.co.uk|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier the same day, it had been reported by [[Daily Mirror|''The Mirror'']] that the transfer cost the ''Seagulls'' a club record fee of £4 million, after turning down an extension to his contract at Blackburn Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/brighton-sign-blackburns-shane-duffy-8708319 | title=Brighton sign Blackburn's Shane Duffy in club record £4million transfer | work=mirror.co.uk/sport | date=26 August 2016 | accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy was an ever-present in Brighton's backline in his first season at the club, helping them gain promotion to the Premier League in 2016–17 by making over 30 league appearances for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=51537&amp;season_id=149|title=Shane Duffy 2016·17|work=Soccerbase|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer following Brighton's promotion, Duffy signed a new contract with the club, extending his stay on the south coast to June 2021.&lt;ref name=TrioNewDeals&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2017/august/trio-sign-new-deals/|title=Trio Sign New Deals|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Northern Ireland===
Duffy was part of the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] youth set-up from the U16 level upward. An U17 regular, he was in the squad for their unsuccessful [[2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2009 European Championship]] qualifying campaign and scored the only goal of the match, a penalty, in the opening game against Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium join flawless Austra|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under17/news/kind=1/newsid=753650.html|publisher=UEFA|date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 17, he was called up to the senior team in June 2009 for a friendly against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] but was an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/07/northern-ireland-italy-pisa|title=Experimental Northern Ireland side beaten by Italy in Pisa friendly|date=7 June 2009|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, he made his Northern Ireland U21 debut, playing the whole match and scoring in the 2–1 away loss to [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8194945.stm|title=Portugal U21 2–1 N Ireland U21|date=11 August 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duffy played several games in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification|2010 UEFA Under-19 Championship qualifiers]], scoring twice in a 4–0 victory over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-19 football team|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Northern Ireland national under-19 football team|Northern Ireland]]'s first win of the qualifying campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman and Duffy in international action|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/duffy-helps-u19-s-to-4-0-win.html|publisher=Everton FC|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
Duffy opted to play for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], for which he was eligible through his [[Irish nationality law|Irish nationality]]. Following a discussion with former international [[Liam Brady]], Duffy was called up to the Republic of Ireland training camp in May 2010. Everton formally informed the [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] of Duffy's change in allegiance,&lt;ref name=DonegalDream&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalsport/Shane-Duffy-follows-his-dream.6101022.jp|title=Shane Duffy follows his dream|last=Foley|first=Alan|date=25 February 2010|work=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Publishing|accessdate=16 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217195848/http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalsport/Shane-Duffy-follows-his-dream.6101022.jp|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the player was called up for a training camp squad for the Republic of Ireland squad to take place in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100890:trapattoni-names-squad-of-23-for-summer-training-camp&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8|title=Trapattoni names squad of 23 for Summer Camp training|accessdate=26 April 2010|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the camp Duffy suffered a 'freak' injury, during a match between the Republic of Ireland development squad and the Ireland amateur side, when he collided with goalkeeper Adrian Walsh and had to undergo life saving surgery at the [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin|Mater Hospital]] after damaging his liver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0522/duffys.html|title= Shane Duffy undergoes emergency surgery|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=22 May 2010|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was discharged six days later after making a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shane Duffy discharged from hospital|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101004:shane-duffy-discharged-from-hospital&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was expected to take a number of months for him to recuperate and regain his fitness, Duffy returned to action in little over ten weeks after his injury and has since appeared for Republic of Ireland under-19 and under-21 squads. He was called up for the U21 friendly versus Portugal in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101607:king-names-u21-squad-for-portugal-friendly&amp;catid=3:under-21&amp;Itemid=11|title=King names U21 squad for Portugal friendly|work=FAI.ie|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players such as Duffy, [[James McClean]], [[Daniel Kearns (footballer)|Daniel Kearns]], [[Darron Gibson]] and [[Marc Wilson (Irish footballer)|Marc Wilson]] had represented Northern Ireland at youth level but later opted to play for Republic of Ireland. The [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] disputed the players' right to do so under [[FIFA]] rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish FA set to take player eligibility dispute to CAS|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8538702.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt the current rules were a "clear disadvantage over all other 206 Associations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IFA to bring case to Court of Arbitration|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0301/ifa_fai.html|publisher=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Football Association]] took a case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] with the hope of getting FIFA to 'uphold' the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first= Emmet|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0518/1224270599814.html|title=Duffy gets his chance to impress Trapattoni|work=The Irish Times |date=18 May 2010|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Duffy's name is often linked with this dispute and the IFA appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], his situation differs from that of players such as [[Darron Gibson]] because of his close family ties to [[Donegal]]. This means he would have been eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland wherever he was born.

On 13 February 2012, less than two years after sustaining a life-threatening injury, Duffy received a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad, replacing the injured [[Richard Dunne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/international/senior-men/102366.html|title=Duffy replaces Dunne in Republic squad|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=13 February 2012|accessdate=13 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517154321/http://www.fai.ie/international/senior-men/102366.html|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2012, Duffy was named in the provisional 26-man Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly fixture against Greece on 14 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efcfeelinblue.com/coleman-duffy-called-up-gibson-set-to-return/|title=Coleman &amp; Duffy called up, Gibson set to return?|publisher=Efcfeelinblue.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=9 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104024425/http://efcfeelinblue.com/coleman-duffy-called-up-gibson-set-to-return/|archivedate=4 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy received his next call-up on 9 May 2014 when he was included in the 32-man provisional squad ahead of friendlies against Turkey, Italy, Costa Rica and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3942/ireland/2014/05/09/4805745/oneill-announces-ireland-squad-for-summer-friendlies |title=O'Neill announces Ireland squad for summer friendlies |publisher=Goal.com|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duffy had his international debut in June 2014 lining up against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in a friendly in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/international/2014/0608/622423-duffy-keen-to-add-to-ireland-caps/ | title=Shane Duffy keen to add to Ireland caps after debut against Costa Rica | publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] | date=8 June 2014 | accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he made his second appearance for Ireland against Switzerland, winning the [[Man of the Match]] award, setting up [[Ciaran Clark]] for the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/ireland-switzerland-player-ratings-euro-2016/71431 | title=Player ratings: Shane Duffy the star as Ireland see off Switzerland 1–0 | publisher=sportsjoe.ie | date=25 March 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Doherty, Conan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.derrynow.com/sport/duffy-is-man-of-the-match-in-republics-win-over-switzerland/82788 | title=Duffy is Man of the Match in Republic's win over Switzerland | publisher=Derry Now | date=25 March 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called up for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], but was an unused sub for the first two matches against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. In the final group game of the tournament Duffy came into the team and a heroic performance helped secure an historic victory against Italy to propel the Republic of Ireland into the last sixteen. He was sent off for a professional foul on [[Antoine Griezmann]] as the Republic of Ireland were knocked out Euro 2016, losing 2–1 to [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36569511|title=France 2–1 Republic of Ireland|date=26 June 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|via=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Kayal is a [[central midfielder]] but he is capable of performing various different roles within the position. He can play as a [[defensive midfielder]], sitting in front of the back four and stifling the opposition or as a [[box-to-box mid]]fielder, protecting the defenders as well as supporting the forwards. Although he is more renowned for his defensive capabilities than attacking, he is still able to contribute well to going forward.&lt;ref name="STVtransfer" /&gt;

Kayal is a tenacious, hard working midfielder, known for high stamina level, aggressive tackling and combative edge, he also has great passing ability and quick feet.&lt;ref name="STVtransfer"&gt;[http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/189093-kayal-completes-celtic-transfer/ Biram Kayal completes Celtic transfer] STV Sport, 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/12/beram-kayal-celtic-scottish-premier-league Coveted Beram Kayal in no hurry to leave Celtic with treble in sight] guardian.co.uk, 12 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Celtic and [[Israel national football team|Israel]] midfielder [[Eyal Berkovic]], described him as being: "Perfect for British football.

====2017–18 season====
Brighton's first match in the top flight for 34 years was at home to eventual champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

Knockaert played in the 1–0 home victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester Utd]] on 4 May 2018 which secured Albion's Premier League status.

==Personal life==
In 2015, Knockaert was given a personal leave by the club after his father, Patrick, became ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City winger Anthony Knockaert to miss Tottenham match|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/leicester-city-winger-anthony-knockaert-miss/story-26201404-detail/story.html|work=Leicester Mercury|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=6 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810032505/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-winger-Anthony-Knockaert-miss/story-26201404-detail/story.html|archive-date=10 August 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, when his father died on 3 November 2016, he sat out of the match against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anthony Knockaert: Brighton players support French winger at father's funeral|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37914763|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 November 2016|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first time he suffered a tragedy: he lost his elder brother, Steve, in 2011 and after scoring in a 3–0 win against Nottingham Forest, Knockaert dedicated his goal to his late brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/anthony-knockaert-brighton-hove-albion-3244735.aspx |title=KNOCKAERT'S EMOTIONAL DEDICATION |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=13 August 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207211721/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/anthony-knockaert-brighton-hove-albion-3244735.aspx |archivedate=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2018, Jahanbakhsh was selected for [[2019 AFC Asian Cup squads#Iran|Iran's 23-man squad]] for the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianfootball.com/news/2018/12/26/queiroz-names-final-23-for-asian-cup/|title=Queiroz names final 23 for Asian Cup|publisher=Persian Football|first=Martin|last=Reza Babry|date=26 December 2018|accessdate=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 2019, he made his competitive debut in a 0–0 draw against [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] in the last match of the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.tarafdari.com/node/1196650|title=قسمت جذاب ترکیب کی روش؛ جهانبخش وارد می‌شود (عکس)|trans-title=The interesting part of Quieroz's squad; Jahanbakhsh enters|publisher=Tarafdari|language=Persian|date=17 January 2019|accessdate=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter match, he scored his first goal in the tournament in the 2–0 victory against [[Oman national football team|Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-afc.com/asiancup/news/round-of-16-ir-iran-2-0-oman|publisher=AFC|date=20 January 2019|accessdate=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Jahanbakhsh has been compared to Iranian legend [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/alireza-jahanbakhsh-eye-catching-iranian-name-and-style|title=Alireza Jahanbakhsh: The eye-catching Iranian, in name and style|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been praised for his assisting ability and has been described as a technically gifted player who is able to use both feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4458984/Watford-Bournemouth-Burnley-chase-9m-Iran-winger.html#comments|title=Watford, Bournemouth and Burnley lead chase for £9m-rated Iran winger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Holland, Jahanbakhsh established himself as a dangerous and pacy player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelderlander.nl/vitesse/toptip-voor-de-finale-ali-en-rickygoal~aab4e34c/|title=Cookies op gelderlander.nl - gelderlander.nl|website=gelderlander.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In several interviews Jahanbakhsh revealed his life time dream is to play in [[Bundesliga]], although there is huge interest in him from Italian and English sides declaring that as a kid he grew up watching his idols [[Ali Daei]], [[Ali Karimi]] and [[Vahid Hashemian]] play for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and Mehdi Mahdavikia for [[Hamburger SV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/421461/It-s-my-dream-to-play-in-Bundesliga-Alireza-Jahanbakhsh/|title=It's my dream to play in Bundesliga: Alireza Jahanbakhsh|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2018/02/22/1663777/iran-s-alireza-jahanbakhsh-on-napoli-s-radar-report/|title=Iran's Alireza Jahanbakhsh on Napoli's Radar: Report - Tasnim News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray made 31 league appearances in his first season with the club and scored 16 goals.

Murray made his first appearance for the 2007–08 season as a 53rd-minute substitute on the opening day in Rochdale's 3–0 loss away to [[Peterborough United]]. His first start of the season came in their 2–2 home draw with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] three days later on 14 August.

==Club career==
===Lewes===
March played at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] between the ages of 11 and 13 and then switched from [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]] to fellow East Sussex club [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]] as a youth player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/media/7925/your-county-spring-2017-ebook.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825232505/https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/media/7925/your-county-spring-2017-ebook.pdf |archivedate=25 August 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solly March Report"/&gt; Lewes were playing in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division, and the 17-year-old March made his first-team debut on 10 September 2011, coming on in the 86th minute as a substitute against [[Aveley F.C.|Aveley]],&lt;ref name=LewesDebut&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://en.calameo.com/read/00000375303f7a57d3f4d |title=Match report Lewes 4:1 Aveley |first=Tom |last=Harper |magazine=The Rooks |publisher=Lewes F.C. |page=13 |date=24 September 2011 |via=Calaméo}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was offered a scholarship by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
===Early days at Brighton===
March signed a three-year contract with Brighton in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11741/7344289/seagulls-seal-non-league-swoop|title=Seagulls seal non-league swoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his transfer it was reported by the Brighton [[The Argus (Brighton)|Argus]] that March had also been offered a contract with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and a trial with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion snatched Solly March from under the nose of Newcastle|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/15107798.Albion_snatched_March_from_under_the_nose_of_Newcastle/|publisher=The Argus|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes manager Steve King suggested that March had been attracted to Brighton because of the style of football they were playing under manager [[Gus Poyet]] and because the move to another East Sussex club would allow him to remain close to his family.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While progressing through Brighton's youth squad, March quickly made an impact for the side and scored a hat–trick, in a 3–1 win over [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]'s youth squad on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=March treble wins it for kids|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/9540044.March_treble_wins_it_for_kids/|publisher=The Argus|date=18 February 2012|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still a member of Brighton's development squad, 2013 saw the beginning of March's senior career.

==Club career==
===Barcelona===
Born in [[Gavà]], [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Montoya started playing football for hometown club [[CF Gavà]], moving to [[FC Barcelona]]'s youth system, ''[[La Masia]]'', at the age of 8. After progressing through its ranks, he was promoted to the [[FC Barcelona B|B-team]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/20121125/abci-barcelona-canteranos-vilanova-201211252131.html|title=El Barcelona, con once canteranos|trans-title=Barcelona, with eleven youth players|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|language=es|date=25 November 2012|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2009–10 Segunda División B|2009–10 season]], Montoya contributed with 22 games as the [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]]-led side returned to the [[Segunda División|second division]] after an 11-year absence. On 26 February 2011 he made his debut for the main squad, coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Adriano (footballer, born 1984)|Adriano]] in the last five minutes of a 3–0 away win against [[RCD Mallorca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=302171&amp;cc=5739|title=Barcelona too strong for Mallorca|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of March 2011, rumours surfaced linking Montoya with [[Valencia CF]], who was willing to pay the €3 million buy-out clause of the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2011/03/29/2416171/valencia-keen-on-barcelonas-martin-montoya-report|title=Valencia keen on Barcelona's Martin Montoya|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|last=Coerts|first=Stefan|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/montoya-renovacion-o-al-valencia-977089|title=Montoya, ¿renovación o al Valencia?|trans-title=Montoya, renewed or to Valencia?|newspaper=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|last=San Antonio|first=Iván|language=es|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April, he made his first start for Barcelona in a 1–2 [[La Liga]] loss at [[Real Sociedad]], suffering a broken [[clavicle]] in the early minutes of the match and being sidelined for the rest of [[2010–11 La Liga|the campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1427527.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=|title=Milito, Montoya out for six weeks|publisher=FIFA|date=1 May 2011|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montoya again spent the vast majority of [[2011–12 Segunda División|2011–12]] with the reserves. His first start for the first team occurred on 12 January 2012, in a [[2011–12 Copa del Rey|2–1 away triumph]] against [[CA Osasuna]] for the [[Copa del Rey]] (6–1 on aggregate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2011_12/copa/octavos/vuelta/osa_bar/|title=Messi enciende las antiniebla|trans-title=Messi turns fog lamps on|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|last=Aldunate|first=Ramiro|language=es|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to injury to [[Dani Alves]] he played in the [[2012 Copa del Rey Final|final of the domestic cup]], featuring the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 win over [[Athletic Bilbao]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=339977&amp;cc=5739|title=Barca say goodbye in style|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had previously scored his first official goal on 6 December 2011, helping the hosts defeat [[FC BATE Borisov]] 4–0 in [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|the group stage]] of the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/barcelona-vs-bate-borisov/249491|title=Barcelona 4–0 BATE Borisov|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montoya scored his second goal as a professional on 1 June 2013, netting the third in a 4–1 home win against [[Málaga CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/348167/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null|title=Barca bring up century in style|publisher=ESPN FC|date=1 June 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623043129/http://espnfc.com/en/report/348167/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null|archivedate=23 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished [[2012–13 La Liga|the season]] with 24 appearances all competitions comprised, totalling 1,678 minutes of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fichajes.com/serie-a/el-inter-de-milan-ya-busca-un-relevo-para-martin-montoya_93815|title=El Inter de Milán insiste en reemplazar a Martín Montoya|trans-title=Inter Milan insist on replacing Martín Montoya|publisher=Fichajes|last=Chamorro|first=David|language=es|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Schelotto was signed by [[Serie A]] side [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] on a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal for €250,000&lt;ref name=Cesena2010bilancio&gt;AC Cesena SpA ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2010 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in July 2009, he was instantly loaned back to his previous club, Cesena. During the [[2009–10 Serie B]] campaign, Schelotto made 40 league appearances for the side, scoring six goals. Of his 40 matches, 33 of them were from the starting XI. He earned just €82,750 in 2009–10 season.&lt;ref name=TNAS/&gt;

On 24 June 2010, Schelotto was signed outright by Atalanta for an additional €2.5 million fee,&lt;ref name=Cesena2010bilancio/&gt; which were just relegated to the Serie B following an 18th-place finish during the [[2009–10 Serie A]], whilst Cesena earned their second consecutive promotion as the club earned promotion to the top flight following a top three Serie B finish. Following his purchase, the player was again loaned back to the [[Emilia-Romagna]]-based club, along with veteran midfielder [[Fabio Caserta]] and central defender [[Maximiliano Pellegrino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3511:accordo-con-latalanta-per-la-cessione-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=124|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727115620/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3511%3Aaccordo-con-latalanta-per-la-cessione-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1%3Anews&amp;Itemid=124|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 July 2011|title=Accordo con l'Atalanta per la cessione di Schelotto|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=31 January 2011|work=AC Cesena|language=Italian|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto wage was also increased significantly. As he left the club in January 2011, he earned €268,333.31 from Cesena for the first 7 months of 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name=TNAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coni.it/images/arbitrati2012/515_A.pdf|title=Dott. Augusto Carpeggiani / Sig. Ezequiel Matias Schelotto|date=6 June 2012|access-date=27 September 2016|work=Tribunale Nazionale di Arbitrato per lo Sport|publisher=Italian National Olympic Committee|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelotto had a bitter Serie A season with Cesena, one in which the team started brightly, even topping the league table by round three, but then endured a landslide that saw the team drop to 18th place and into the relegation places by November. He lost his starting place on 24 October as the coach used [[Luis Antonio Jiménez|Luis Jiménez]] as a new supportive striker in the three forward formation. Since then, he only made four starts to replace [[Giuseppe Colucci (footballer)|Giuseppe Colucci]] (who was injured) and [[Stephen Appiah]] (twice), respectively, as one of the midfielders. His last start — and last match — with Cesena was on 23 January 2011, a match where Cesena fielded an inferior squad against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] where the three forwards, Schelotto, [[Igor Budan]], and [[Dominique Malonga]], were not regular starters.

During the first half of the 2010–11 campaign, Schelotto made 17 league appearances with one goal. On 31 January 2011, he was transferred to Serie A side [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] on loan.

====Catania (loan)====
On 31 January 2011, Schelotto transferred to Catania in Sicily, on loan from Atalanta. In his transfer deal, Catania were sold the option to sign the player on a co-ownership basis at the conclusion of the current campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciocatania.it/article.php?id=21979|title=Matias Ezequiel Schelotto al Catania|date=31 January 2011|access-date=27 September 2016|publisher=Calcio Catania|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto started his first match for the Sicilians on 6 February 2011, a match that Catania lost 1–0 away to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], in part due to an early red card by Argentine defender [[Pablo Sebastián Álvarez|Pablo Álvarez]].

====Return to Atalanta====
Schelotto returned to Atalanta on 1 July 2011. He was included in the first team squad of Atalanta for [[2011–12 Serie A]] campaign, which the club was promoted back to the top tier as the champions of Serie B in May 2011. During his 1½ seasons with the Serie A club, he earned a transfer to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano]] for €6 million transfer fee in January 2013, despite in a cash-plus-player deal.

===Internazionale===
Schelotto joined Italian giants [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] on 31 January 2013 for €3.5 million cash plus 50% "card" of [[Marko Livaja]] (Inter valued 50% rights of Livaja for €2.5 million but bought the rights back from Cesena for €1.5 million cash).&lt;ref&gt;AC Cesena S.p.A. ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FC Internazionale Milano SpA ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto made his debut on 3 February in a 3–1 loss against [[A.C. Siena|Siena]], playing the first 45 minutes before giving way to [[Mateo Kovačić]]. He scored his first goal for the club in the 1–1 draw against city rivals Milan on 24 February 2013.

Schelotto spent two seasons on loan to other Italian clubs from 2013–14 season to 2014–15 season; on 31 August 2015, it was agreed between the two parties Schelotto would terminate his contract by a mutual consent.

====Sassuolo (loan)====
On 29 August 2013, Schelotto signed on loan with Serie A side [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/43567|title=Transfers, Schelotto moves to Sassuolo|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|publisher=FC Internazionale Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September he scored his first league goal for Sassuolo in a 2–2 draw with [[S.S.

==International career==
Thanks to his Italian ancestry, Schelotto was eligible for Italian [[citizenship]]. In November 2009, he was called up to the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian national under-21 team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/notizie/news/ezequiel-schelotto-convocato-nellunder-21.html |title=Ezequiel Schelotto convocato nell'Under 21 |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-09 |publisher=AC Cesena |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722030742/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/notizie/news/ezequiel-schelotto-convocato-nellunder-21.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately featured in the starting lineup in a game against [[Hungary national under-21 football team|Hungary]] on 13 November.

Since making his debut, he played all available [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification]] matches, and unusually as right back in the last qualification match against Wales in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/azzurri/2010/09/07-127847/Europei+U.21,+l'Italia+vince+e+si+qualifica+per+i+playoff|title=Europei U.21, l'Italia vince e si qualifica per i playoff|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=11 September 2010|work=Corriere dello Sport – Stadio|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that match, Italy beat [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] 1–0 and narrowly topped Wales as the group winner. He assisted [[Stefano Okaka]] to score the second goal in the first leg of the playoff round against [[Belarus national under-21 football team|Belarus]], but missed the second leg due to suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.football-italia.net/oct09w.html|title=U-21: No replacements|date=9 October 2010|work=Football Italia|accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy were eventually eliminated due to a 0–3 loss against Belarus in [[Barysaw|Borisov]].

On 10 August 2012, he was called up by [[Cesare Prandelli]] to the [[Italy national football team|Italian senior team]] for a friendly against [[England national football team|England]], where he made his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 2–1 Italy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19238374|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Born in [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name=BDFutbol/&gt; Schelotto also holds an Italian passport due to his Italian descent from [[Cogoleto]] ([[Province of Genoa|GE]]), in [[Liguria]], where his great-great-grandfather Giovanni Battista Francesco Schelotto emigrated from in the late 19th century. He is the fifth of seven children — including 5 males — two of whom are also footballers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/Sport/514179/|title=Schelotto, parla il "levriero": "Dopo il ko ci rialzeremo"|publisher=ecodibergamo.it|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/node/11937|title= Schelotto wants Azzurri career |publisher=football-italia.net|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in South Africa, Tau began his career with [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] in the [[Premier Soccer League]]. He made his professional debut for the club on 25 February 2014 in the league against [[Orlando Pirates]]. He came on as an 85th-minute substitute for [[Domingues]] as Sundowns lost 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundowns 0–1 Orlando Pirates|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/02/25/south-africa/psl/mamelodi-sundowns/orlando-pirates/1528923/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tau then scored his first professional goal for the club during a [[Nedbank Cup]] match on 22 March 2014 against [[Lamontville Golden Arrows F.C.|Golden Arrows]]. His 90th-minute goal was the fourth and final goal for Sundowns as they won 4–1 against the Arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Arrows 1–4 Sundowns|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/03/22/south-africa/cup/golden-arrows/mamelodi-sundowns/1654849/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored his first goal in international club competition on 5 April 2015 in a [[CAF Champions League]] match against [[TP Mazembe]].

On the advice of then-youth coach Rhulani Mokwena, he was [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[National First Division]] side [[Witbank Spurs F.C.|Witbank Spurs]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/sport/soccer/psl/how-percy-tau-went-from-slacker-to-superstar-at-mamelodi-sundowns-14785377|title=How Percy Tau went from slacker to superstar at Mamelodi Sundowns|publisher=Independent Online|last=Molefe|first=Mazola|date=4 May 2018|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 6 February 2016 in a 3–1 win over [[African Warriors F.C.|African Warriors]] and went on to score 3 goals in 11 appearances during his loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Warriors 1–3 Witbank Spurs|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/02/06/south-africa/1st-division/african-warriors/witbank-spurs/2126739/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a season with Witbank Spurs, Tau rejoined Mamelodi Sundowns and was included in the squad for the club's [[CAF Champions League]] campaign. He featured throughout and played every minute of both legs of a 3–1 aggregate win over Egyptian side [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] in the [[2017 CAF Champions League#Final|CAF Champions League Final]].

During the 2017–18 season, Tau scored 11 goals to help Mamelodi Sundowns to the league title.

Towell started his career with Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and made his debut in the first half of the [[2010–11 Celtic F.C. season|2010–11 season]]. He then had two loan spells with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] before leaving Celtic in 2012.

Towell has represented the [[Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team|Republic of Ireland under-21]], [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] teams

==Club career==
===Celtic===
Towell started his career at [[Crumlin United F.C.|Crumlin United]] and in 2007 moved to Celtic. In November 2010, he made his professional debut coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Jos Hooiveld]] in the 57th minute of Celtic's 2–2 draw against [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9230565.stm |title=Celtic 2–2 Inverness CT |date=27 November 2010 |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he provided an assist for [[Paddy McCourt]].

====Hibernian (loans)====
On 25 January 2011, he joined [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/20110125/irish-defender-signs-on-loan_2262950_2276355 |title=Irish Defender Signs on Loan |publisher=Hibernian F.C. |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128225207/http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/20110125/irish-defender-signs-on-loan_2262950_2276355 |archivedate=28 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell made his debut a day later, in a 2–0 loss to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].&lt;ref name = "rangers 2-0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9372935.stm|title=Hibs 0–2 Rangers|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at fault for the concession of the second Rangers goal, as a misplaced pass allowed [[Nikica Jelavić]] a clear chance to score.&lt;ref name = "rangers 2-0"/&gt; Despite this bad start, Towell helped to solidify the Hibs defence during the latter part of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name = "keen to tie down"/&gt; Hibs manager [[Colin Calderwood]] stated in April 2011 that he hoped to sign Towell for a longer period.&lt;ref name = "keen to tie down"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/top-stories/Hibs-keen-to-tie-down.6753164.jp|publisher=Johnston Press|first=Iain|last=Collin|date=17 April 2011|accessdate=17 April 2011|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|title=Hibs keen to tie down on-loan Richie Towell on a more permanent contract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell said in April 2011 that he received abuse from [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] supporters in [[Edinburgh derby]] matches because he was Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/39I39ll-get-abuse-because-I39m.6744599.jp|title='I'll get abuse because I'm a Catholic,' says Towell|work=[[The Scotsman]]|publisher=Johnston Press|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011|last=Bathgate|first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also said that this made him more determined to play better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Edinburgh-derby-39Rivalry-is-a.6744737.jp|work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|publisher=Johnston Press|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011|title=Edinburgh derby: 'Rivalry is a million miles from Old Firm'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell returned to Celtic at the end of the season, having made 15 starting appearances for Hibs.&lt;ref name = "second loan"/&gt;

Towell re-signed on loan for Hibs on 25 August 2011, on a deal due to run until June 2012.&lt;ref name = "second loan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14669133.stm|title=Celtic's Richie Towell rejoins Hibernian|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the first match of his second loan spell only 3 days later, starting as Hibs lost 2–0 to [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals Hearts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = 29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell started to find first-team opportunities limited after new manager [[Pat Fenlon]] made several siginings in the January transfer window. Two right backs and two central midfielders came in with one other right back going out. However, Fenlon said that once Towell had got his fitness levels up he would be back in the first team picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Dundalk===
Towell was signed by [[Stephen Kenny (footballer)|Stephen Kenny]] for [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] in December 2012, ahead of the 2013 Airtricity Premier Division season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundalk confirm signing of Celtic's Richie Towell and re-signing of Stephen McDonnell|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3942/ireland/2012/12/19/3613531/dundalk-confirm-signing-of-celtics-richie-towell-and-re#|publisher=Goal.com|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towell made his League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers on the opening night of the 2013 season and was hugely influential in Dundalk’s second-placed finish that year, scoring seven times in 31 league appearances. He also picked up the [[PFAI]] Young Player of the Year award. He won back to back league titles with Dundalk in 2014 and 2015 scoring 11 and 25 goals in the respective seasons, and got his first taste of Champions League football with the [[League of Ireland]] champions.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
Towell signed for [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 30 November 2015. Towell made his debut for the Sussex club in the third round of the [[2015-16 FA Cup]] on 9 January 2016 away against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] where The Seagulls lost 1-0 to a [[Robert Snodgrass]] penalty. 
Despite not playing a single league game in the [[2015-16 Football League Championship]] season Towell made an appearance in the [[2016 Football League play-offs|2016 Championship play-offs]] as a substitute away against [[Sheffield Wednesday]] where Brighton were beaten 2-0 and 3-1 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/36165388 |title= Championship play-offs: Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Brighton as it happened - Live - BBC Sport|publisher=BBC Sport |date= 13 May 2016 |accessdate= 13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell scored his first goal for The Albion in a 3-1 [[FA Cup]] loss away to then [[National League]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln]] on 28 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/richie-towell-brighton-injury-3063167-Nov2016/|title=Former Dundalk star Richie Towell edges towards Brighton comeback|first=Shane|last=Costello|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richie Towell departs Dundalk to sign for Championship high-flyers Brighton|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/richie-towell-departs-dundalk-to-sign-for-championship-highflyers-brighton-34245085.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=independent.ie|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38700730 |title= Lincoln City 3-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion - BBC Sport|publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 January 2017 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towell's only league game to date with The Seagulls came against his then future loan club [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]] on 7 March 2017 where he came on as a substitute where Brighton won 2-0 at the [[New York Stadium]]. At the end of the season Brighton &amp; Hove Albion were promoted to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39111438 |title=Rotherham United 0-2 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion - BBC Sport|publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate= 7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/39422564 |title=Brighton promoted to Premier League - relive EFL action as it happened - Live - BBC Sport|publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2017 |accessdate= 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2017, following Brighton's promotion to the [[Premier League]], Towell signed a deal to keep him at the club until 2019.

====Rotherham (loans)====
