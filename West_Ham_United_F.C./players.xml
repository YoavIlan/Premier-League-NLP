'''Łukasz Fabiański''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈwukaʂ faˈbʲaɲskʲi|-|Pl-Łukasz Fabiański.ogg}}; born 18 April 1985) is a Polish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]].

Having begun his career at [[Legia Warsaw]], Fabiański joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for £2.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2007, and was mainly used as back-up, but played as the club won the [[2014 FA Cup Final]]. On the expiration of his contract in 2014, he joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea]].

A full international for Poland since 2006, Fabiański has represented his country on over 40 occasions and was included in the squads for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. He played every match for Poland at [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] after the first group match with [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] due to first-choice goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]]'s injury.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Fabiański was born in [[Kostrzyn nad Odrą]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; After starting his career with [[Polonia Słubice]], Fabiański joined the noted independent football academy MSP Szamotuły at age 14, where he honed his footballing skills.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/arsenal/article1774760.ece |title=Poland's new goalkeeping union not keen to send in the clowns |newspaper=The Times |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2007 |location=London |first=Nick |last=Szczepanik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabiański then was signed in the 2004–05 season by [[Lech Poznań]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Legia Warsaw===
In the winter of 2005, Fabiański was signed by [[Legia Warsaw]], where he competed with [[Artur Boruc]] for a place in the team. After Boruc was sold to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], Fabiański took over as starting goalkeeper on 24 July 2005 in a match against [[Arka Gdynia]], which ended 0–0.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The following season, he helped Legia win the [[2005–06 Ekstraklasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football: Player profiles of Arsenal's impressive Carling Cup youngsters |first=Harry |last=Leech |work=The Guardian |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/13/arsenal-player-profiles-football-carling-cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started all 30 matches of the campaign, in which he conceded 17 goals.&lt;ref name=whu8things&gt;{{cite web |title=Eight things you probably didn’t know about Lukasz Fabianski |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=20 June 2018 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |url= https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/june/20-june/eight-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-lukasz-fabianski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, his performances led to him being awarded the "Football Oscar" for the best goalkeeper in the [[Ekstraklasa]].&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

===Arsenal===
On 8 May 2007, Fabiański underwent medical tests in London after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] agreed a transfer fee with Legia Warsaw worth approximately £2.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="transfer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=465703&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=&amp;title=Gunners+to+pick+up+Pole |title=Gunners to pick up Pole |first=Peter |last=O'Rourke |publisher=Sky Sports |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was confirmed on 11 May 2007 by Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]].&lt;ref name="transfer2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=466047&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=TV+Online+exclusive:+Wenger+-+Fabianski+is+set+to+sign |title=Wenger: Fabianski is set to sign |author=Richard Clarke |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=11 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513023735/https://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=466047&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=TV+Online+exclusive:+Wenger+-+Fabianski+is+set+to+sign &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabiański formally signed for Arsenal on 26 May with a long-term contract.&lt;ref name="arsenaloffrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?article=468626&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;sub=Polish+goalkeeper+Lukasz+Fabianski+joins+Arsenal&amp;sublid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Polish+goalkeeper+Lukasz+Fabianski+joins+Arsenal&amp;f=rss |title=Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski joins Arsenal |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205406/https://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?article=468626&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;sub=Polish+goalkeeper+Lukasz+Fabianski+joins+Arsenal&amp;sublid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Polish+goalkeeper+Lukasz+Fabianski+joins+Arsenal&amp;f=rss &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in a 2–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 25 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Fabiański's fond farewell to Arsenal |first=Piotr |last=Kozmiński |publisher=UEFA |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |url= https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=eng/news/newsid=2113026.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arsenal 2-0 Newcastle |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008002.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fabiański's early Arsenal career, two of his most notable appearances came in the 5–1 defeat to rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[2007–08 Football League Cup|2007–08 League Cup]] semi-final and the first leg of the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League]] second round match with [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Fabiański received criticism for conceding soft goals in the Porto match as he scored an own goal and was blamed for the second goal after picking up a backpass from [[Sol Campbell]], with Porto scoring from the resulting free-kick.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} In January 2010, Arsène Wenger stated that Łukasz Fabiański could become one of the best goalkeepers in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribalfootball.com/arsenal-boss-wenger-fabianski-can-be-among-best-594841 Arsenal boss Wenger: Fabianski can be among the best | Premiership News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406230204/http://www.tribalfootball.com/arsenal-boss-wenger-fabianski-can-be-among-best-594841 |date=6 April 2012 }}. tribalfootball.com (24 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabiański played the last four matches for Arsenal in the [[2009–10 Arsenal F.C. season|2009–10 season]] after top-choice goalkeeper [[Manuel Almunia]] suffered a wrist injury. He was criticised for conceding soft goals in the defeats to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], but kept clean sheets in the matches at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2914/champions-league/2010/02/17/1795174/porto-2-1-arsenal-lukasz-fabianski-errors-hand-portuguese |title=Porto 2–1 Arsenal: Lukasz Fabiański errors hand Portuguese side the edge |author=Niall McGlone |publisher=Goal.com |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
[[File:Lukasz Fabianski Arsenal vs Birmingham 2010-11.jpg|185px|right|thumb|Fabiański playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2010]]
Fabiański started the [[2010–11 Arsenal F.C. season|2010–11 season]] as Arsenal's second-choice goalkeeper. On 21 September 2010, he made his first start of the season in a [[2010–11 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[North London Derby|neighbours]] Tottenham Hotspur at [[White Hart Lane]], which Arsenal won 4–1 after extra time. Fabiański almost cost the match for Arsenal as he failed to stop [[Robbie Keane]]'s long-range effort, despite getting a hand to the shot. After the match, he revealed he was disappointed. He had a solid match in his second match of the season replacing the injured Manuel Almunia one week later in a [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] 3–1 away win against [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]. He saved [[Cléo]]'s second penalty of the match in the second half to deny Partizan a lifeline. He later turned [[Ivica Iliev]]'s effort around the post from point-blank range just before the final whistle. Arsène Wenger later commented that Fabiański had a "faultless" match and they finally saw the player who they usually see in training. He kept his first clean sheet in a win over Manchester City, where he made many saves in a match that ended 3–0. He was later named man of the match on an Arsenal.com poll after a brilliant display to keep Arsenal in the match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/-we-saw-the-fabianski-we-see-in-training- 'We saw the Fabianski we see in training' | News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001095644/https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/-we-saw-the-fabianski-we-see-in-training- |date=1 October 2010 }}. Arsenal F.C..com (28 September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; After the City match, Wenger admitted he could well become the club's number one goalkeeper after impressive displays in the matches since the Partizan match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2010/10/24/2181614/arsene-wenger-admits-lukasz-fabianski-could-displace-manuel Arsene Wenger admits Lukasz Fabianski could displace Manuel Almunia as Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper]. Goal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 2010, Fabiański was widely criticised for an error that lead to the only goal as Arsenal lost at home to Newcastle United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ministryofglove.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/lukasz-fabianski-mistake-v-newcastle/ |title=Fabianski Mistake Hands Newcastle Surprise Win |publisher=MinistryOf Glove.com |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08112010/58/premier-league-toon-shock-arsenal.html |title=Toon Shock Arsenal |website=Eurosport |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814172159/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08112010/58/premier-league-toon-shock-arsenal.html |archivedate=14 August 2011}}(archived)&lt;/ref&gt; However, he produced a strong display to keep a clean sheet in the next Premier League match, against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], in which he managed to prevent a draw with a last-minute save, and then initiating a counter-attack with a long throw of the ball that led to another Arsenal goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3293518,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Chamakh brace sinks Wolves |date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Wolves match, Arsenal played [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], where Fabiański received the man of the match award from [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/221169/report |title=Everton v Arsenal match report |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabiański was injured for Arsenal's crucial match with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] but returned for the equally important match with London rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], making many crucial saves in helping Arsenal to win 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9309539.stm |title=Arsenal 3–1 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2011, he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury as he was warming up with the help of [[Wojciech Szczęsny]], which ruled him out for the remainder of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/874906/op-to-sideline-lukas-fabianski-for-season?cc=5901 |title=Op to sideline Fabianski for season |website=ESPN Soccernet |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Szczęsny established himself as Arsenal's first choice goalkeeper ahead of his Polish compatriot.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====2011–12 season====
[[File:Lukasz Fabianski 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fabiański warming up before a match against [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] on 21 April 2012]]

Fabiański spent the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]] as backup to Wojciech Szczęsny, making his first appearance against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 6 December 2011, Fabiański was selected to start in Arsenal's [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] match against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], but was substituted out after 25 minutes following a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/15933230 |title=Olympiakos 3 – 1 Arsenal |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Injuries limited Fabiański's appearances during the [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13 season]], where he made only five [[2012–13 Premier League|Premier League]] appearances as back-up to Wojciech Szczęsny. In March 2013, after Szczęsny was dropped, Fabiański started in goal in the second-leg of Arsenal's [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] tie against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2–0 and retained his place in the team to make his first Premier League start of the season away against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on 16 March 2013, again keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. Fabiański started in Arsenal's next three league matches against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. However, an injury sustained in the match against Norwich by Fabiański allowed Szczęsny to return to the starting line-up and reclaim his position as first-choice goalkeeper.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====2013–14 season====
During the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Fabiański was used as Arsenal's starting goalkeeper in [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and [[2013–14 Football League Cup|League Cup]] matches, with Szczęsny remaining first-choice in [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League]] and [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] matches.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 19 February 2014, Fabiański came on as a substitute in the 37th minute of a 2–0 Champions League home defeat against Bayern Munich, after Szczęsny was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] for a foul on [[Arjen Robben]]. With Szczęsny suspended, Fabiański was in the starting line-up for the second leg and saved a late penalty from Bayern's [[Thomas Müller]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 12 April, Fabiański saved penalties from [[Gary Caldwell]] and [[Jack Collison]] in an [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final [[Penalty shootout|shootout]] victory over Wigan Athletic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26897266 |title=Wigan 1–1 Arsenal |date=12 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his only Premier League appearance of the season in the last match on 11 May, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win that caused his opponents Norwich City to be relegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Osborne |first=Chris |title=Norwich 0–2 Arsenal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27273461 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, Fabiański started for Arsenal in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] as they defeated [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] 3–2 after extra time at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27354148 |title=Aaron Ramsey's extra-time winner ensured Arsenal ended their nine-year wait for a trophy by coming from two goals behind to beat Hull City in a dramatic FA Cup final at Wembley |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swansea City===
On 29 May 2014, it was announced that Fabiański would join fellow Premier League side Swansea City on a free transfer when his Arsenal contract expired on 1 July. He said of the transfer, "The main reason I came to Swansea was because I want to be the number one goalkeeper."&lt;ref name=Swansea&gt;{{cite news |title=Lukasz Fabianski leaves Arsenal to join Swansea City on free transfer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27616469 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut for the club on 16 August, a 2–1 win against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] in the first match of the [[2014–15 Premier League|Premier League season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |title=Man Utd 1–2 Swansea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28718345 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 2014, Fabiański was sent off in Swansea's 1–3 loss at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a foul on [[Diafra Sakho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rose |first1=Gary |title=West Ham 3–1 Swansea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30266472 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2015, Fabiański kept a clean sheet and was named [[man of the match]] in a 1–0 win against Arsenal on his return to the [[Emirates Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/9847357/lukasz-fabianski-says-swanseas-win-over-arsenal-was-not-personal |title=Lukasz Fabianski says Swansea's win over Arsenal was not personal |date=11 May 2015 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July, Fabiański signed a new four-year contract with Swansea, which would keep him at the club until June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33807475 |title=Fabianski signs 4-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabiański played all 38 of Swansea's Premier League games of [[2017–18 Swansea City A.F.C. season|2017–18]] and was voted Player of the Season by the club's supporters. His performances did not prevent the club from ending the season 18th and they were relegated to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref name=sb1718/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Swansea City's Player of the Season Awards 2018 |last=Gwilym |first=Andrew |website=WalesOnline |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-citys-player-season-awards-14607269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44020155 |title=Swansea 1–2 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Dafydd |last=Pritchard |date=14 May 2018 |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
On 20 June 2018, Premier League club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] announced the transfer of Fabiański for £7&amp;nbsp;million. He signed a three-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lukasz Fabianski: West Ham sign Swansea City's Polish goalkeeper |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 June 2018 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44546138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabiański, the first Pole to play first-team football for West Ham, was installed as first-choice 'keeper at the start of the [[2018–19 West Ham United F.C. season|2018–19 season]].&lt;ref name=whu8things/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standout players of 2018/19: Lukasz Fabianski |first=Adrian |last=Clarke |publisher=Premier League |date=13 October 2018 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |url= https://www.premierleague.com/news/878144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:1 lukasz fabianksi 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Fabiański playing for Poland against Portugal at Euro 2016]]

Having represented Poland regularly at [[Poland national under-21 football team|under-21]] level, Fabiański's performances for Legia Warsaw saw him soon making his debut for the [[Poland national football team|senior international team]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] on 29 March 2006.&lt;ref name="arsenaloffrelease"/&gt;

Fabiański was included in Poland's squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], serving as back-up to [[Artur Boruc]] and [[Tomasz Kuszczak]]. During the qualifying campaign for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]], he made one appearance, playing all 90 minutes in Poland's 2–2 away draw against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] on 21 November 2007.&lt;ref name="pzpn3777"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/em/2008/qualifikation/gruppea/serbien-polen/ |title=Serbien gegen Polen 2:2 |publisher=Fussballdaten |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Fabiański replaced the suspended Boruc for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifiers]] against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] and [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. He also played in another qualifying match against San Marino in April 2009.

Despite going into [[UEFA Euro 2016]] as an understudy to [[Wojciech Szczesny]], an injury in the first game of the tournament led to Fabiański becoming first choice for the rest of the tournament. He went on to keep clean sheets in both of the remaining group games against World champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]. He then kept his place as Poland defeated [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the Round of 16 before losing to eventual winners [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on penalties.

==== 2010–11 season ====
Reid signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 5 August 2010, on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="west ham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100805/reid-signs_2236884_2112684 |title=Reid signs |publisher=West Ham United Official Website |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921085430/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100805/reid-signs_2236884_2112684 |archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=811998&amp;sec=transfers&amp;cc=5739 |title=Hammers sign All Whites international Reid |date=5 August 2010 |work=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His transfer fee was the subject of a dispute between West Ham United and FC Midtjylland as West Ham withheld the fee to bring to [[UEFA]]'s attention fees owing to them from the sale of [[Alessandro Diamanti]] to [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham refuse to pay Winston Reid transfer due to bitter dispute with Fifa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/8823344/West-Ham-refuse-to-pay-Winston-Reid-transfer-due-to-bitter-dispute-with-Fifa.html |publisher=Telegraph |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut on 14 August, in a 3–0 loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darling |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8906162.stm |title=BBC Sport&amp;nbsp;– Football&amp;nbsp;– Aston Villa 3–0 West Ham |publisher=BBC News |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored his first goal for the club in a 5–1 win against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the Fifth Round of the [[FA Cup]] on 21 February 2011.&lt;ref name="WHUGoal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/9404702.stm |title=Winston Reid sympathises with New Zealand quake victims |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |author=Leon Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season for West Ham United Reid's first team opportunities were limited, making just 12 appearances in all competitions as the club was relegated.

==== 2011–12 season ====
For the 2011–2012 season Reid stayed at West Ham following relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], and scored his first league goal for West Ham United in a 4–1 away win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottingham Forest 1&amp;nbsp;– 4 West Ham United Match Report |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110828/nottm-forest-1-west-ham-4_2234233_57971 |publisher=WHFC Official Website |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid also scored the winning goal against arch-rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in a 2–1 home win on 4 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham United 2&amp;nbsp;– 1 Millwall Match Report |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120204/west-ham-2-millwall-1_2234233_59529 |publisher=WHFC Official Website |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham finished the season by winning the [[2012 Football League Championship play-off Final|Football League play-offs]] against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], and gaining promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

==== 2012–13 season ====
In summer 2012, Reid opted to stay and train with his West Ham teammates ahead of the new Premier League season rather than represent [[New Zealand at the 2012 Summer Olympics#Men's tournament 2|New Zealand]] at the London Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/west-ham-defender-winston-reid-chooses-club-over-country-as-he-turns-down-olympics-7869151.html |title=West Ham defender Winston Reid chooses club over country as he turns down Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Football&amp;nbsp;– Sport&amp;nbsp;– London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first ever Premier League goal in West Ham's 3–0 victory against Fulham on 1 September 2012, and in May 2013 Reid signed a two-year extension to his contact until the end of the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winston Reid inks two-year deal at West Ham |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/8616509/Winston-Reid-inks-two-year-deal-at-West-Ham |publisher=www.stuff.co.nz |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his best season since joining the club, Reid was rewarded for his form on 8 May 2013 when he was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]], as West Ham went on to finish the season in 10th.&lt;ref name=Hoty&gt;{{cite web |title=Reid crowned Hammer of the Year |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/reid-crowned-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_3172136 |publisher=Www.whufc.com |accessdate=9 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511115924/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/reid-crowned-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_3172136 |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013–14 season ====
Reid scored the opening goal in a 3–0 away win against rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in October 2013.

== International career ==
{{update|section|date=July 2016}}
Reid received Danish [[citizenship]] in 2006&lt;ref name="west ham"/&gt; and was subsequently called up for the [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19 national team]]. He played for various Danish age-grade representative teams, in particular the under-19s and [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21s]], and played in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs|2009 European Under-21 Championship qualification]] tournament.

On 11 March 2010, Reid stated that he wanted to play for the senior [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand team]],&lt;ref name="3News_145900"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/All-Whites-bolster-ranks-with-Danish-star-Winston-Reid/tabid/415/articleID/145900/Default.aspx |title=All Whites bolster ranks with Danish star Winston Reid |author=Gourdie, Andrew |date=11 March 2010 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 March 2010 he made himself available for New Zealand's [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] selection.&lt;ref name=commits&gt;{{cite web |author=Woodcock, Fred |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/3443252/Reid-changes-mind-commits-to-All-Whites |title=Reid changes mind, commits to All Whites |work=The Dominion Post |date=13 March 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2010, Reid was included in New Zealand's 2010 World Cup squad even though New Zealand national coach [[Ricki Herbert]] had never seen him play.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnstone |first=Duncan |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/world-cup/3676399/All-Whites-World-Cup-squad-named |title=All Whites World Cup squad named |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his international debut in a friendly against [[Australia national football team|Australia]] in [[Melbourne]] two weeks later. His second appearance came in the All Whites' shock 1–0 victory over [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], leaving Ricki Herbert "suitably impressed" with Reid's performance,&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3756323"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/fifa-world-cup/all-whites/3756323/A-real-downer-for-Serb-fans-in-dress-rehearsal |title=A real downer for Serb fans in dress rehearsal |author=Smith, Tony |date=31 May 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplanting [[Ben Sigmund]] on the right side of Herbert's three-man defence.

On 15 June 2010, Reid scored an equalising goal in stoppage time against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup, thus securing a draw as well as his first ever international goal and New Zealand's first ever point in a World Cup finals match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_12 New Zealand 1–1 Slovakia] ''BBC Sport'', 15 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the retirement of [[Ryan Nelsen]] from international football in 2013, Winston Reid was named captain of the All Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/8450714/Winston-Reid-named-All-Whites-captain |title=Winston Reid named new All Whites captain |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013 |first=Tony |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November 2013, Reid was ruled out of the All Whites' FIFA World Cup playoff against Mexico, not only leaving a void on defense, but also with his successor as captain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11152966 |title=Key questions: What now for Reid-less All Whites? |date=7 November 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=15 January 2017 |via=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2017, Reid has won 23 caps for his country.

'''Aaron William Cresswell''' (born 15 December 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (football)#Full back|left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Cresswell made his first-team debut for [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 2008 and made 70 league appearances for the club before signing for Ipswich in 2011, following a tribunal to agree the value of the transfer. He made 138 appearances for Ipswich scoring six goals, before joining West Ham United in July 2014. He made his international debut for England in November 2016 in a friendly against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].

==Club career==
===Tranmere Rovers===
Born in [[Liverpool]], Merseyside, Cresswell started his career with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]' youth system before signing his first professional contract in July 2008.&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2008 in a [[EFL League One|League One]] match with [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] which ended in a 1–0 loss.&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt;

Although he was offered a new contract by the club at the end of the 2010–11 season,&lt;ref name="Rovers Offer Six New Contracts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rovers Offer Six New Contracts |url=http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10365~2356474,00.html|publisher=Tranmere Rovers F.C |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=10 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513095616/http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10365~2356474%2C00.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tranmere manager Les Parry expected Cresswell to turn down the contract offer saying "Aaron has got four or five [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs trying to sign him; if I had to guess I would say Aaron might be leaving us this summer."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Ipswich Town===
[[File:Aaron Cresswell.jpg|thumb|upright|Cresswell playing for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2011]]

In June 2011, the media reported that [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had won the race to sign the player beating the likes of West Brom and Doncaster Rovers for his signature, although the clubs had failed to agree a fee and resolution of this was expected to go to a transfer tribunal.&lt;ref name="Cresswell set for Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = Town win race for Cresswell| url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18673| publisher = TWTD.co.uk| date = 30 June 2011| accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-year contract was later announced to have been signed.&lt;ref name="Ipswich Town sign Tranmere defender Aaron Cresswell"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich Town sign Tranmere defender Aaron Cresswell| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13989734.stm?| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 1 July 2011| accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2012, fine performances for Ipswich Town, where he won Supporters Player Of The Year Award, led the player to be linked with [[Premier League]] clubs such as Aston Villa.&lt;ref name="Villa line up young Ipswich full-back Cresswell"&gt;{{cite news| title = Villa line up young Ipswich full-back Cresswell| url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-target-aaron-cresswell-1163547| newspaper = Daily Mirror| location = London| date = 24 July 2012| accessdate = 26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===

On 3 July 2014, Cresswell joined West Ham United on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £3.75 million, plus add on clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11685/9383317/transfer-news-west-ham-boss-sam-allardyce-delighted-with-aaron-cresswell-deal|title=Transfer news: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce delighted with Aaron Cresswell deal|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140703/hammers-snap-up-cresswell_2236884_3947722? |title=Hammers snap up Cresswell |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=3 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707031807/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140703/hammers-snap-up-cresswell_2236884_3947722 |archivedate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his West Ham debut on 16 August 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Rose |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28718387 |title=West Ham United 0–1 Tottenham Hotspur |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November he scored his first goal for the club, in the 1–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |title=West Ham United 1–0 Newcastle United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30156773 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Cresswell was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]] and Player's Player of the Year.&lt;ref name=HotY&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/May/6-May/Aaron-completes-Player-Awards-hat-trick! |title=Aaron completes Player Awards hat-trick! |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=6 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510024444/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/May/6-May/Aaron-completes-Player-Awards-hat-trick%21 |archivedate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell played all 38 league matches and all four FA Cup matches for West Ham in [[2014–15 West Ham United F.C. season|2014–15]].&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt; In June 2015, Cresswell signed a new contract which would keep him with West Ham until 2020, with the option for a further two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33321175 |title=Aaron Cresswell: West Ham defender signs five-year contract |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell made the highest number of appearances of any West Ham player in [[2015–16 West Ham United F.C. season|2015–16]], playing in 47 matches. He featured in 37 of the possible 38 Premier League matches scoring two goals, away to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 26 December, and at eventual champions [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in a 2–2 draw on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=2016&amp;united=Premier_League_2015-16 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Premier League 2015–16 | publisher=West Ham Stats | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Cresswell was injured in a 3–0 pre-season victory over [[Karlsruher SC]]. Suffering a knee-ligament injury, Cresswell was initially expected to be out of action for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36883514 | title=Aaron Cresswell: West Ham defender out for four months with knee injury | publisher=BBC Sport | date=25 July 2016 | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell recovered in time to make his return in West Ham's 1–0 victory away at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 15 October, assisting [[Manuel Lanzini]] for the winning goal, however his comeback was cut short after he was sent-off for two yellow cards within a minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37594218 |title=Crystal Palace 0–1 West Ham United |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He immediately became a starter under Rivera, playing in all the remaining seven matches of the campaign as his side achieved a mid-table position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.com.br/noticia/713949_pai-queria-que-balbuena-estudasse-mas-ele-virou-jogador-capitao-aos-20-e-hoje-brilha-no-corinthians|title=Pai queria que Balbuena estudasse, mas ele virou jogador, capitão aos 20 e hoje brilha no Corinthians|trans-title=Balbuena's father wanted him to study, but he became a player, captain at 20 and today shines at Corinthians|publisher=[[ESPN Brasil]]|language=pt|date=28 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balbuena quickly became a regular starter in 2011, being also [[Captain (association football)|team captain]] as the club achieved promotion from [[Paraguayan División Intermedia|División intermedia]]. He scored his first goal for the club on 3 April of that year, netting the game's only in a home success over [[Deportivo Caaguazú]].

Balbuena joined [[Club Rubio Ñu|Rubio Ñu]] ahead of the [[2013 Paraguayan Primera División season|2013 season]], but remained at the club for only six months before moving to defending champions [[Club Nacional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/deportes/se-sumo-otro-mazacotte-592820.html|title=Se sumó otro Mazacotte|trans-title=Another Mazacotte joined|publisher=[[ABC Color]]|language=es|date=7 June 2013|access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the latter side, he was also first-choice and reached the [[2014 Copa Libertadores Finals]], losing it to [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]].

On 15 August 2014, [[Club Libertad|Libertad]] bought 50% of Balbuena's federative rights, and the player signed a four-year deal with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/deportes/futbol/balbuena-ya-es-gumarelo-1276518.html|title=Balbuena ya es gumarelo|trans-title=Balbuena already is ''gumarelo''|publisher=ABC Color|language=es|date=15 August 2014|access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again a mainstay, he won the [[2014 Paraguayan Primera División season|2014 Clausura]] tournament.

===Corinthians===
On 16 February 2016, Balbuena moved abroad for the first time in his career after agreeing to a three-year deal with [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] side [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corinthians.com.br/balbuena-assina-com-corinthians-por-tres-temporadas/|title=Balbuena assina com Corinthians por três temporadas|trans-title=Balbuena signs with Corinthians for three seasons|publisher=SC Corinthians Paulista|language=pt|date=16 February 2016|access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club nine days later by starting in a 1–1 [[Campeonato Paulista]] away draw against [[Esporte Clube São Bento|São Bento]], and scored his first goal on 19 March in a 4–0 home routing of [[Clube Atlético Linense|Linense]] for the same competition.

A key defensive unit at ''Timão'', Balbuena lifted the [[2017 Campeonato Paulista]], [[2017 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] and [[2018 Campeonato Paulista]] during his spell.

Zabaleta can operate on both sides of the pitch as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] and is known for his tenacious style of play, and has [[Captain (association football)|captained]] his club on numerous occasions.

With [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Zabaleta won all of English football's major honours: the [[FA Cup]] ([[2010–11 FA Cup|2011]]), the Premier League ([[2011–12 Premier League|2012]] and 2014), and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] ([[2013–14 Football League Cup|2014]] and 2016). Before joining Manchester City, Zabaleta played for [[La Liga]] club [[RCD Espanyol]], where he won the [[2005–06 Copa del Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/pablo-zabaleta/|title=Pablo Zabaleta|accessdate=22 April 2014|publisher=Eurosport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 333 appearances over nine seasons for Manchester City before signing for London-based club West Ham United in the summer of 2017.

A full international since 2005, Zabaleta represented Argentina at the [[2011 Copa América|2011]] and [[2015 Copa América]], and was part of their team which finished as runners-up in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He was also in their team which won gold at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]].

==Club career==
===San Lorenzo===
Born in [[Buenos Aires]], Zabaleta was raised in [[Arrecifes]]. He began his career at [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro]] in 2002 after progressing through their youth ranks, having been signed at the age of 12 from local club ''Obras Sanitarias''. He started playing as a [[defensive midfielder]] but eventually moved to the right side of midfield.

===Espanyol===
Zabaleta was transferred to [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] in 2005 for €3 million after being [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20]]s [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], which Argentina won. During the [[2005–06 La Liga|2005–06 season]], Zabaleta helped Espanyol to win the [[2005–06 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], playing the full 90 minutes in the 4–1 defeat of [[Real Zaragoza]] in [[2006 Copa del Rey Final|the final]].&lt;ref name="paradise"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zabaleta rejects Juventus in favour of move to 'paradise' |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/29/manchestercity.espanyolzabaleta |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 August 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Zabaleta suffered a [[shoulder]] injury that kept him off the pitch for almost three months, already having established himself as an undisputed first team choice. Later in the season, he featured in the [[2006–07 UEFA Cup]] [[2007 UEFA Cup Final|final]], where Espanyol lost on penalties to fellow Spanish side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].

===Manchester City===
====2008–2012====

In the summer of 2008, Zabaleta transferred to [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] after rejecting an offer from [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He stated upon joining that "the offer of Manchester City is impossible to reject."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Espanyol's Zabaleta turns down Juventus to join Man City for £6.5m |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1050567/Espanyols-Zabaleta-turns-Juventus-join-Man-City-6-5m.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=29 August 2008 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ladyman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having passed a medical and agreed personal terms, Zabaleta completed a five-year deal with City on 31 August 2008 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be the buy-out clause Zabaleta had attached to his contract of around £6.45 million.&lt;ref name=paradise/&gt; Zabaleta joined a day before Manchester City was bought by the [[Abu Dhabi United Group]], led by [[Sheikh Mansour]], which enabled a wealth of investment in the club.

On 13 September 2008, Zabaleta made his debut for Manchester City in a 3–1 defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].

On 1 January 2011, Zabaleta played his 100th game for Manchester City in all competitions, coming off the bench against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in a 1–0 win at Eastlands.

However, City's title challenge faded with a loss of form in February and March 2011.

On 1 May 2011, Zabaleta scored his second goal of the season in a Premier League match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. This secured a 2–1 win for the Citizens and put them seven points ahead of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the race for [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|fourth place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester City 2–1 West Ham |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/293139?cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011, it was reported that Italian club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] were keen on signing Zabaleta, but Manchester City insisted the player was not for sale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Roma to launch £6m Zabaleta bid, but Manchester City unwilling to sell Argentina defender |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2014502/Roma-launch-6m-bid-Pablo-Zabaleta-Manchester-City-unwilling-sell-Argentina-defender.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=14 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zabaleta agreed a three-year contract in July 2011. On 1 October 2011, Zabaleta started and played the full 90 minutes at right-back in a 4–0 win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] in the Premier League, as regular starter [[Micah Richards]] was not available.

In November 2011, Zabaleta extended his contract with City until the summer of 2015. Zabaleta said, "I'm in a very good team, and I try to do my best for the club, the team and the fans. I didn't think twice, I gave a quick answer because I was so happy to sign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2063216/Manchester-City-new-deals-Adam-Johnson-Pablo-Zabaleta.html | location=London | newspaper=Daily Mail | title=Going places!

On 30 April 2012, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the right-back slot in a 1–0 victory over rivals Manchester United thanks to a first-half stoppage time header by [[Vincent Kompany]] from a corner at the City of Manchester Stadium. Zabaleta scored the first goal in City's dramatic 3–2 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on the final day of the [[2011–12 Premier League|season]], a result which secured the first league title for the club since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 3 QPR 2|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4313835/Man-City-3-2-QPR-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html|newspaper=The Sun|location=London|first=Shaun|last=Custis}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2012, Zabaleta scored a late equalising goal in a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.

====Inter Milan (loan)====
On 4 August 2009, it was said that Arnautović was on the verge of a move to Italian giants [[Inter Milan]]. The deal had been largely held up due to a stress fracture in Arnautović's right foot, leading to a re-negotiation of the deal between the clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item302920/Arnautovic-set-for-Inter-switch |title=Arnautovic set for inter switch |publisher=[[ESPN Star]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729164353/http://www.espnstar.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item302920/Arnautovic-set-for-Inter-switch |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August, it was announced by Twente that the details for the loan had been finalised, Arnautović would join Inter on loan for the season. The deal was said to become permanent if he was to play a set number of matches. If the deal did not become permanent the player would return to Twente on a pre-agreed contract of two years, with an option to extend the contract for a third year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctwente.com/en/news/index.php?item=8787 |title=Arnautovic signs for Inter |publisher=[[FC Twente]] |accessdate=6 August 2009 |date=6 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://www.fctwente.com/en/news/index.php?item=8787 |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his unofficial debut for Inter in a friendly match on 5 September 2009 against Swiss team, [[FC Lugano|Lugano]], the final score was 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inter.theoffside.com/international-duty/inter-3-3-lugano.html |title=Inter 3–3 Lugano |publisher=The Offside |accessdate=25 September 2009 |date=5 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://inter.theoffside.com/international-duty/inter-3-3-lugano.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring three goals in five matches for the [[Austria national under-21 football team|Austria U21s]], Arnautović earned praise from manager [[Andreas Herzog]] who described him the best Austrian footballer of 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herzog über Arnautovic: "Bester Spieler der letzten 30 Jahre" |trans-title=Herzog about Arnautovic: "Best player of the past 30 years" |url=http://derstandard.at/1267132294666/Herzog-ueber-Arnautovic-Bester-Spieler-der-letzten-30-Jahre |work=Der Standard |language=de |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://derstandard.at/1267132294666/Herzog-ueber-Arnautovic-Bester-Spieler-der-letzten-30-Jahre |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović played his first match for the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] national senior team on 11 October 2008 against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. He scored his first goals for Austria in a 3–0 win over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] on 8 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria 3–0 Azerbaijan |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/299356/report.html?soccernet=true |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=5 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://espnfc.com/en/report/299356/report.html?soccernet=true |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović started in all ten of Austria's matches during their successful [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, scoring in a win over [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] and both fixtures against neighbours [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Austria-boss-tells-Marko-Arnautovic/story-27985950-detail/story.html|title=Stoke City: Austria boss tells Marko Arnautovic 'Stoke is not your last stop'|date=14 October 2015|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=8 November 2015|first=Pete|last=Smith|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117011749/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Austria-boss-tells-Marko-Arnautovic/story-27985950-detail/story.html|archivedate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović started all but one of Austria's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group D|qualification matches]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], only missing the game against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] through suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Republic of Ireland v Austria Match Report, 11/06/2017, WC Qualification Europe | first = Patric | last = Ridge | work = Goal.com | date = 11 June 2017 | accessdate = 4 July 2018 | url = http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/republic-of-ireland-v-austria/7t31kmcv9nz066th7snrc66zt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored four goals in the 10 games, but Austria's fourth-place finish would not be enough for qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ – Qualifiers – Europe | publisher = FIFA | accessdate = 4 July 2018 | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/group=276493/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NFT/&gt;

===Santos===
Felipe Anderson then played for Santos' youth categories, and was promoted to the senior squad following a rash of injuries in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Yahoo!

His first goal of his footballing career came on 11 February 2011, when Felipe came off the bench at half time to replace [[Keirrison]] against [[Esporte Clube Noroeste|Noroeste]], scoring from a long range shot in the 70th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2011/02/12/brazil/paulista-a1/santos-futebol-clube-sao-paulo/esporte-clube-noroeste/1046381/|title=Santos 2–0 Noroeste|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, he scored his first league goal, against [[Avaí Futebol Clube|Avaí]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2011/07-09-2011/avai-santos.html FELIPE ANDERSON SAI DO BANCO E AJUDA O SANTOS A VIRAR JOGO SOBRE O AVAÍ (FELIPE ANDERSON LEAVES THE BENCH AND HELP SANTOS TO COMEBACK OVER AVAÍ)]; Globoesporte.com, 7 November 2011 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, he signed a new contract with Santos, running until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://placar.abril.com.br/brasileiro/santos/felipe-anderson/noticias/novo-menino-da-vila-felipe-anderson-chega-a-acordo-e-renova-com-o-santos.html Novo “Menino da Vila”, Felipe Anderson chega a acordo e renova com o Santos (New "Menino da Vila", Felipe Anderson reaches an agreement and renews with Santos)]; Placar, 5 November 2011 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his following season, Felipe Anderson had more chances in first team alongside [[Neymar]], due to [[Paulo Henrique Ganso|Ganso]]'s injuries and [[Elano]]'s poor form (both players left Santos in the middle of the season). On 9 February 2012, he scored his first goal of the season, against [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo-SP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancenet.com.br/santos/Neymar-Santos-vence-Botafogo_0_643135909.html Neymar faz três e comanda a goleada do Santos sobre Botafogo-SP (Neymar scores thrice and lead Santos'thrashing victory over Botafogo-SP)]; Lance!Net, 9 February 2012 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 31 January 2013, the agreed transfer to the Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for €7.5 million failed due to late arrival of a necessary international fax from Brazil to close the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/01/felipe-anderson-andrea-poli-deals-fall-through/ Felipe Anderson &amp; Andrea Poli Deals Fall Through]; forzaitalianfootball.com, 31 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lazio===
On 25 June 2013, Lazio agreed a [[Euro|€]]7.8 million fee with Santos,&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/santos/noticia/2013/06/santos-acerta-transferencia-de-felipe-anderson-para-lazio-por-r-xx.html Santos acerta transferência de Felipe Anderson para o Lazio por € 7,8 mi (Santos closes transfer of Felipe Anderson to Lazio for € 7.8m)]; Globo Esporte, 25 June 2013 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Felipe Anderson signed a five-year deal worth €800,000 a year. Santos received 50% of the transfer sum and the third part owner [[Doyen Sports]] would get the rest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/06/agreement-finally-reached-for-felipe-anderson/ Lazio Reach Deal For Felipe Anderson]; Forza Italia Football, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lazio's sporting director Igli Tare criticized the third part owner Doyen Sports for numerous times delaying the transfer, “It will remain in history as the most paradoxical and shocking negotiations I have ever been a part of,” said Tare. “These third party owners changed their minds continually. When we had everything decided, they would start from scratch two hours later. It all happened for a full week, so it felt like being in the Twilight Zone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fantamaster.it/news/lazio-pace-fatta-inzaghi-felipe-anderson-si-rivedra-al-fantacalcio/|title=Lazio, pace fatta tra Inzaghi-Felipe Anderson!

====2017–18 season====
During the [[2017–18 S.S. Lazio season|2017–18]] season Felipe Anderson's form suffered numerous setbacks.

==Style of play==
A quick, well-rounded, and technically gifted [[midfielder]], with a slender and diminutive but long-limbed physique, Felipe Anderson is considered a promising and talented young player. He is predominantly known for his pace, and is regarded as one of the fastest players in the modern game; although not imposing physically or in the air, he also possesses good ball control, quick feet, and excellent [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, which allow him to beat opponents in one on one situations. A tactically versatile player, he is capable of playing in several different positions due to his wide range of skills, high work-rate, and ability to both create and score goals: he has been used as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] or as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfield]] [[playmaker]], but has most frequently been deployed as either a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], due to his offensive movement and tendency to operate between the lines; he is capable of playing on either flank or through the centre of the pitch, due to his ability to cut into the middle and strike on goal, or move out to the wing to provide accurate [[Cross (football)|crosses]] to teammates in the area. In addition to his speed, stamina, creativity and technical ability, he is known for his eye for goal, and is gifted with a powerful and accurate shot from distance with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed; he is also an accurate [[Direct free kick|set-piece]] and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] taker. He can also serve as an [[Assist (football)|assist]]-man due to his creative ability, vision, dead-ball delivery, and eye for the final pass.&lt;ref name="da Anderson a Yakovenko"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Magic_Cup/05-09-2013/magic-campionato-serie-a-tutti-nuovi-stranieri-serie-a-anderson-yakovenko-201102296407.shtml|title=Tutti i nuovi stranieri della serie A: da Anderson a Yakovenko|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Massimo Tanzillo|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ita/news/newsid=2227457.html|title=UEFA.com's weekly wonderkid: Felipe Anderson|publisher=UEFA|author1=Paolo Menicucci|date=28 March 2015|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcioweb.eu/2013/07/i-nuovi-stranieri-della-serie-a-felipe-anderson/64556/|title=I nuovi stranieri della Serie A: Felipe Anderson|publisher=CalcioWeb.eu|language=Italian|author1=Vincenzo Currò|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondosportivo.it/2013/08/20/fantacalcio-alla-scoperta-di-felipe-anderson/|title=Fantacalcio: alla scoperta di Felipe Anderson|publisher=mondosportivo.it|language=Italian|author1=Demetrio Bertuletti|date=20 August 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/scouting-and-prospects/78/post/2233109/scouts-notebook-felipe-anderson|title=Scout's Notebook: Lazio's speedster Felipe Anderson has lit up Serie A|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Nick Dorrington|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.ilmessaggero.it/sslazio/lazio_felipe_anderson_profilo/295304.shtml|title=Lazio, ecco chi è Felipe Anderson Il nuovo jolly biancoceleste|publisher=Il Messaggero|author1=Daniele Magliocchetti|language=Italian|date=22 June 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/meet-neymars-former-partner-crime-whos-setting-serie-alight|title=Meet Neymar’s former partner in crime who's setting Serie A alight|publisher=FourFourTwo|author1=Alasdair Mackenzie|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/23/lazio-felipe-anderson-serie-a|title=Lazio’s Felipe Anderson lights up surreal Sunday with his ‘dance rock’ style|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Paolo Bandini|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/lazio/2016/11/11/news/anderson_dubbi_malumori_hoedt_cataldi-151818772/|title=Lazio, i dubbi di Anderson: "Qui per sempre?

'''Andrew Thomas Carroll''' (born 6 January 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Carroll started his professional career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.

Carroll signed for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on the last day of the [[transfer window]] on 31 January 2011 for a fee of £35&amp;nbsp;million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. Carroll was bought to replace [[Fernando Torres]], who moved from Liverpool to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on the same day for a fee of £50&amp;nbsp;million. An injury sustained in December delayed his Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3–0 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a £2&amp;nbsp;million loan deal that would see Carroll spend a season-long loan at West Ham. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of £15&amp;nbsp;million.

Between 2010 and 2012, Carroll played nine matches for England, scoring twice, including one goal at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

In doing so, he became the youngest ever player to represent Newcastle in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palermo (a) UEFA Cup Group stage Game 2|publisher=NUFC.com |url=http://www.nufc.com/html/2006-07html/2006-11-02palermo-a.html|accessdate=2 November 2006|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his [[FA Cup]] debut on 17 January 2007, appearing as substitute for the last ten minutes in the 5–1 home defeat by [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Newcastle 1–5 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6258857.stm |accessdate=17 January 2007|date=17 January 2007 |first=Chris |last=Bevan| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070119212551/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6258857.stm| archivedate= 19 January 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2007, Carroll made his [[Premier League]] debut for Newcastle, coming on as a substitute in the 87th minute in the 1–0 defeat by [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], almost scoring in the process; only a good save from Wigan [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[John Filan]] prevented him from scoring his first Newcastle goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Wigan 1–0 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6371353.stm |accessdate=25 February 2007|date=25 February 2007 |first=John |last=Sinnott| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070224134019/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6371353.stm| archivedate= 24 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he was the recipient of the Wor Jackie Milburn Trophy, awarded every year to the rising star of [[North East England|North-East]] football, chosen from among Newcastle players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Is Andy Carroll a future England international? |publisher=Sport.co.uk |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/features/Football/986/Is_Andy_Carroll_a_future_England_international.aspx|accessdate=17 October 2010|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007–08====

==Discipline==
Carroll has been involved in many off-the-pitch incidents in his career. On 14 September 2008, he was arrested by police in Newcastle, and later accepted a police caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Footballer arrested over assault |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Newcastle-United-Footballer-Andy-Carroll-Arrested-For-Assaulting-A-Woman/Article/200809315103943 |publisher=Sky News |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208200332/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Newcastle-United-Footballer-Andy-Carroll-Arrested-For-Assaulting-A-Woman/Article/200809315103943 |archivedate=8 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2009, he was arrested in the aftermath of a nightclub fight, again in Newcastle, accused of smashing glass in a man's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Carroll held after nightclub fight |publisher=Yahoo! Eurosport UK |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/07122009/58/championship-carroll-held-nightclub-fight.html |accessdate=23 March 2010 |date=7 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213021117/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/07122009/58/championship-carroll-held-nightclub-fight.html |archivedate=13 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with assault and in October 2010 he pleaded guilty to common assault and was fined £1,000. He was also ordered to pay £2,500 compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Footballer Andy Carroll pleads guilty to assault|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11620004|accessdate=3 December 2010|date=25 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101110022101/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11620004| archivedate= 10 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on international duty with the England U-19s, Carroll and teammates [[Scott Sinclair]] and [[Ryan Bertrand]] were sent home from the squad after breaking a curfew on 14 October 2007 during preparation for a match against [[Romania national under-19 football team|Romania U-19s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England youngsters sent home |publisher=Sky Sports |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12010_2800655,00.html |accessdate=4 March 2009 |date=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414061712/http://www.skysports.com/story/0%2C19528%2C12010_2800655%2C00.html |archivedate=14 April 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Carroll was allegedly involved in an altercation with teammate [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]] during training that left Taylor with a broken jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Newcastle investigate sex-text brawl| publisher=Yahoo!

On 18 October 2010, Carroll was charged with assault in an incident with his ex-girlfriend. Claiming self-defence, and having given a local hotel as his address, Carroll was granted bail on the condition that he resided with then Newcastle captain Kevin Nolan until the case resumed in January. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Newcastle striker Andy Carroll must live with captain|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11563332|publisher=BBC News|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days following his bail, Carroll's car was [[Arson|set on fire]] while parked on Nolan's driveway, with the club captain's garage door also being daubed with obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Andy Carroll's car torched at Kevin Nolan's home|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/breaking-news/2010/10/21/andy-carroll-s-car-torched-at-kevin-nolan-s-home-72703-27518147/|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following England's 1–1 draw with Ghana on 29 March 2011, England manager [[Fabio Capello]] told Carroll to curtail his drinking habits. Liverpool manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] responded by saying, "Well he's never bought me a drink. I've been with him at [[Boyzone]] concerts and he's still never bought me a drink!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11669_6845486,00.html | publisher=Sky Sports | title=Dalglish defends Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in April 2012, Carroll admitted that he had gained a reputation for drinking and socialising during his time at Newcastle, but that since joining Liverpool in January 2011 he had "settled down" and changed his lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/17/andy-carroll-liverpool-goals | newspaper=The Guardian |location=London | first=Andy | last=Hunter | title=Andy Carroll confident match-winning goals can settle him at Liverpool | date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll's time at West Ham United has been blighted by many injuries. His former manager, [[Sam Allardyce]] claimed this was partly caused by Carroll failing to look after himself and not doing the required rehabilitation work to keep himself fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thisisfutbol.com/2018/10/blogs/premier-league/allardyce-questions-carrolls-lifestyle/|title='He could look after himself better' - Allardyce savages the lifestyle of West Ham party animal - thisisfutbol.com|date=26 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is described as possessing phenomenal [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability, as well as fantastic acceleration and vision and the ability to ghost past defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gartner|first1=Daniel|title=All you need to know about West Ham target Manuel Lanzini [VIDEO]|url=http://outside90.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-west-ham-target-manuel-lanzini-037/|website=Outside90|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is nicknamed "La Joya" ("the jewel").&lt;ref name=uaesign/&gt;&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/news/detail/item60524/Lanzini-set-to-join-West-Ham-on-loan | title=Lanzini set to join West Ham on loan | publisher=foxsportsasia.com | accessdate=7 July 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015031/http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/news/detail/item60524/Lanzini-set-to-join-West-Ham-on-loan | archivedate=24 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently holds the record of being the player that scored the earliest goal in the history of Argentina's derby, the [[Superclásico]], scoring only 43 seconds after the beginning of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/deportes/lanzini-marco-rapido-historia-superclasico_0_BkYHmKdiwQg.html|title=Lanzini marcó el gol más rápido en la historia del Superclásico|publisher=Clarín|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Early career and first steps at River Plate ===

He stood out in indoor soccer football divisions, demonstrating his capabilities in the class of 1993 of the Club Academia Kaly de Ituzaingó, a neighbourhood club. Ramón Maddoni, who discovered players like [[Juan Román Riquelme]], [[Carlos Tévez]] and [[Esteban Cambiasso]], wanted to take him to [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] for a test match but the young Lanzini firmly declined the call, stating that he only aimed to play for the club that he supported: [[Club Atlético River Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/deportes/futbol/Lanzini-busca-Aimar_0_320968047.html|title=Lanzini busca ser como Aimar|publisher=Clarín|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally taken to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/Manuel-estilo_0_307769354.html|title=Manuel de estilo|publisher=Olé|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing as a playmaker in junior divisions. Lanzini began training in River and, after several tests, Pedro Vega, ex player and coach of inferior divisions from the club, ordered to hire him. In 2008 the 8th division team of which he was a part of won the trophy for that division, with a personal mark of 9 goals, only 2 less than Leonardo Salguero, who was his companion in attack and top scorer of the team with 11 goals. On 2 November 2008, River Plate won the junior division's [[Superclásico]] 3–0 to [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] with Lanzini scoring 2 goals and assisting the mentioned Salguero in other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldia.com.ar/edis/20081102/dep_popu45.htm|title=Los pibes de River, mareados de festejos|publisher=El Día|date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debut at River Plate (2010–11 season) ===

In 2010, the coach of River Plate's first team [[Ángel Cappa]], included him in the team for the winter preseason, disputing several matches in [[Salta Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Cappa-indulto-Canales-cito-promesa_0_143400058.html|title=Cappa indultó a Canales y citó a una promesa|work=La Razón|date=21 July 2010|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194610/http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Cappa-indulto-Canales-cito-promesa_0_143400058.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his informal debut in a friendly match against [[Central Norte]], a 3–0 victory, coming on as a second-half substitute for [[Ariel Ortega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tycsports.com/notas/57197-caruso-debut-tres-goles-y-festej-river|title=Caruso debutó con tres goles y festejó River|publisher=TyC Sports|date=21 July 2010|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402171055/http://www.tycsports.com/notas/57197-caruso-debut-tres-goles-y-festej-river|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played another friendly match against [[Juventud Antoniana]], in which his performance obtained a very good reception from the press and fans alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Amistosos/Nacionales/6859-manuel-lanzini-jugo-muy-bien-ante-juventud-antoniana.html|title=Lanzini cumplió un papel destacado|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=25 July 2010|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125715/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Amistosos/Nacionales/6859-manuel-lanzini-jugo-muy-bien-ante-juventud-antoniana.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/deportes/futbol/Lanzini-brisa-aire-fresco_0_305369555.html|title=Lanzini: Una brisa de aire fresco|publisher=Clarín|date=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mentioned performances in 2010 winter's preseason satisfied the coach. Finally he made his first appearance on 8 August 2010, against [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] for the first match of the Torneo Apertura 2010. River won 1–0 and Lanzini was replaced at half time by [[Facundo Affranchino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/Falta-tiempo_0_313768643.html|title=Falta un tiempo|publisher=Olé|date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This appearance made him one of the youngest players to make their debut in the First Division for River Plate, being only 17 years, 5 months and 24 days old, only after [[Daniel Villalva]], legend [[Adolfo Pedernera]] and the ex-Barcelona and Real Madrid player [[Javier Saviola]].
After his debut, coach Ángel Cappa did not include him in the match against [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]]. Nevertheless, he played the next match against [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] in place of suspended [[Ariel Ortega]]. In that match he made an assist that allowed his teammate [[Rogelio Funes Mori]] to score the goal for the 3–2 victory, rounding out a strong performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/River-aprovecho-Independiente-lider_0_160800012.html|title=River se aprovechó de Independiente y es uno de los líderes del Apertura|work=La Razón|date=22 August 2010|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112437/http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/River-aprovecho-Independiente-lider_0_160800012.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 September, during the match River lost against [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sársfield]], he suffered from an injury after a strong tackle from [[Leandro Somoza]], which ruled him out for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/desgarron-Manu_0_330566963.html|title=El desgarrón de Manu|publisher=Olé|date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Apertura-2010/7321-tres-fechas-sin-lanzini.html|title=Tres fechas sin Lanzini|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=7 September 2010|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910104703/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Apertura-2010/7321-tres-fechas-sin-lanzini.html|archive-date=10 September 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his comeback to the first team on the 12 match of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/futbol/545803-100902-0-River-tropezo-nuevo-y-espera-Boca-un-clima-muy-complicado|title=River tropezó de nuevo y espera a Boca en un clima muy complicado|publisher=Infobae.com|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluminense (2011–12 season) ===

19 July 2011 an agreement was reached between [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], with the latter taking the player on loan for a fee of US$400,000, with a transfer option of [[Euro|€]]15,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Mercado-de-Pases-/Mercado-de-Pases-2011/10557-manuel-lanzini-a-prestamo-al-fluminense.html|title=Lanzini fue cedido a préstamo al Fluminense|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=19 July 2011|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817092709/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Mercado-de-Pases-/Mercado-de-Pases-2011/10557-manuel-lanzini-a-prestamo-al-fluminense.html|archive-date=17 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut in the 3–0 victory against [[Figueirense Futebol Clube|Figueirense]] for the 16th date of the [[Brasileirao 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,no-rio-fluminense-vence-figueirense-por-3-a-0-e-alivia-crise-no-clube,759910,0.htm|title=No Rio, Fluminense vence Figueirense por 3 a 0 e alivia crise no clube|publisher=Esportes|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would then score his first official goal in the team's victory 2–1 against [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]] for the 20th date of that tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Ex-River/11011-manuel-lanzini-gol-fluminense-san-pablo-brasileirao.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131013220841/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Ex-River/11011-manuel-lanzini-gol-fluminense-san-pablo-brasileirao.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 October 2013|title=Lanzini marcó su primer gol con la camiseta del Fluminense|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-internacional/Lanzini-Fluminense_0_546545659.html|title=La primera vez de Manu|publisher=Olé|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances and character made the president of the club label him "The new [[Neymar]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/Lanzi-Ney_0_538746449.html|title=El Neymar argentino|publisher=Olé|date=19 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016235852/http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/Lanzi-Ney_0_538746449.html|archivedate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most important goal for the club was against [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] in the [[Río de Janeiro]] [[Fla-Flu]] derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Ex-River/11412-lanzini-clasico-carioca.html|title=Lanzini convirtió en el clásico contra Flamengo|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=11 October 2011|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181107/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Ex-River/11412-lanzini-clasico-carioca.html|archive-date=17 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his good performances, Fluminense was unable to retain the player and after the loan he had to come back to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolavip.com/39390/el-fluminense-quiere-retener-a-lanzini/|title=El Fluminense quiere retener a Lanzini|publisher=Bolavip.com|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comeback to River Plate and consolidation ===

==== 2012–13 season ====

He came back to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] 30 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/veras-volver_0_728327474.html|title=Me verás volver|publisher=Olé|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jumped to the pitch as a starter on the team's first appearance in the tournament, scoring the team's only goal in the 1–2 loss against [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano de Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Inicial-2012/14038-lanzini-fue-el-mejor-en-su-vuelta.html|title=Lanzini fue el mejor en su vuelta|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=6 August 2012|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002105823/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Inicial-2012/14038-lanzini-fue-el-mejor-en-su-vuelta.html|archive-date=2 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his comeback, he asked to use the club's iconic number 10 shirt to the coach [[Matías Almeyda]], who allowed the player to do so. Nevertheless, during Almeyda's leadership Lanzini was not able to assure himself a place in the pitch, sometimes watching the matches from the bench or not forming part of the main team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/lanzini_ni_al_banco_de_suplentes_0_766723700.html|title=Lo Lanzini del banco|publisher=Olé|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almeyda was finally fired and the club's most successful coach to that date, ex [[Inter Milan]] player [[Ramón Díaz]] was appointed as team manager. With him, Lanzini's chance of regaining a place as a starter increased. Coach made a strong bet on Lanzini, putting him as a starter in the team's 2–0 victory against [[Club Atlético San Martín (San Juan)|San Martín (SJ)]] and Manu corresponded scoring one of the two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/Lanzini-alegria_0_825517795.html|title=Lanzini a la alegría|publisher=Olé|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Inicial-2012/15279-lanzini-volvio-y-fue-figura.html|title=Lanzini: regreso, gol y figura|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=9 December 2012|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212005501/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Inicial-2012/15279-lanzini-volvio-y-fue-figura.html|archive-date=12 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then considered a regular starter for the team.
During the 12th date of the [[2012–13 Argentine Primera División season|Torneo Final 2013 tournament]], he was able to score his first goal in the [[Superclásico]], one of the most heated football rivalries in the world, in the 1–1 draw against [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]]; this goal, as of 2018, stands out as the fastest goal in the derby's history (43 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Final-2013/17009-video-goles-boca-vs-river-torneo-final-2013-superclasico.html|title=El gol más rápido en la historia del Superclásico|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=5 May 2013|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707161537/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Final-2013/17009-video-goles-boca-vs-river-torneo-final-2013-superclasico.html|archive-date=7 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; River would end up in 2nd place in the Torneo Final of the [[2012–13 Argentine Primera División season|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Final-2013/17466-manuel-lanzini-river-desde-primer-momento-busco-triunfo-independ.html|title=Lanzini: "Lo fuimos a buscar desde el primer momento"|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=9 July 2013|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612145134/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/futbol-profesional/Torneos-Locales/Torneo-Final-2013/17466-manuel-lanzini-river-desde-primer-momento-busco-triunfo-independ.html|archive-date=12 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013–14 season ====

During the preseason facing the Torneo Final from the 2013 [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|season]], the club received an offer from the [[Baniyas SC|Baniyas]] from [[United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tycsports.com/notas/81999-lanzini-emiratos|title=¿Lanzini a Emiratos?|publisher=TyC Sports|date=18 July 2013|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193225/http://www.tycsports.com/notas/81999-lanzini-emiratos|archive-date=29 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportsla.com/noticias/111028-ofrecen-casi-7-millones-por-manuel-lanzini-desde-el-futbol-arabe?country=ar|title=Ofrecen 6.5 millones por Manuel Lanzini|publisher=Fox Sports|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201307/26071-una-nueva-oferta-para-que-lanzini-juegue-en-emiratos-arabes.html|title=Llegó otra oferta para que Lanzini juegue en Emiratos Árabes|publisher=Télam|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the player turned down the offer because, citing his own father, he considered to prioritize his professional sporting career over economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Mercado-de-Pases-/Mercado-de-pases-2013/18069-lanzini-hector-padre-explica-motivos-rechazo-oferta-dubai.html|title=Padre de Lanzini: "Manuel me dijo que quiere ser feliz en River"|publisher=La Página Millonaria|date=24 July 2013|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185324/http://www.riverplate.com/Noticias/Mercado-de-Pases-/Mercado-de-pases-2013/18069-lanzini-hector-padre-explica-motivos-rechazo-oferta-dubai.html|archive-date=29 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained one of the team highlights in both [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|Torneo Inicial 2013]] and international cup [[Copa Sudamericana 2013]] during that year, but the overall form of the team was inconsistent and thus River Plate did not win any trophies in that year.

Things would be different for the club in 2014. That year proved to be one of the most memorable year's in club's history, winning the [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|Torneo Final 2014]] and the [[Copa Sudamericana 2014]] kicking out Boca Juniors from that international competition. Lanzini remained half of the year as part of the team, so he was part of the Torneo Inicial 2014 trophy; during that time he continued to be one of the most important players in the pitch. He had the honor to once again score a goal in the team's victory in the 2014 [[Superclásico]] against Boca Juniors, the so-called "Bombonerazo" which began a series of crushing victories of River Plate over Boca Juniors. This match stood out in particular because it was the one that definitively launched the career of his teammate [[Ramiro Funes Mori]], a defender who scored a header in the last minutes of the match; he would end up also playing in the [[Premier League]], as Lanzini, for [[Everton FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-primera/Boca-River_0_1111089189.html|title=Bombonerazo|publisher=Olé|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; River Plate would end up being [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|Torneo Final 2014]] champion, with a very solid performance from Manu, who scored 2 goals in 18 appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/paso-gloria_0_1140486269.html|title=Campeón soy yo|publisher=Olé|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the beginning of local [[2014 Argentine Primera División|2014 Torneo de Transición Championship]] and international [[Copa Sudamericana 2014]], 6 August 2014 he transferred to the [[Al-Jazira Club]] of the [[UAE Pro-League]], for US$6.000.000, with a salary amounting to US$12.000.000 in 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/river-plate/futbol/titulo_0_1189681056.html|title=Ultimo Lanzini|publisher=Olé|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Jazira===
In 2014 Lanzini became the youngest foreign player, at 21, to play in the [[UAE Arabian Gulf League]] when he signed a four-year deal for [[Al Jazira Club]]. He had been courted by clubs in England, Spain, Italy and Turkey, and was signed as a replacement for [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]-bound [[Abdelaziz Barrada]].&lt;ref name=uaesign&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/arabian-gulf-league/al-jazira-reach-for-youthful-injection-with-21-year-old-lanzini | title=Al Jazira reach for youthful injection with 21-year-old Lanzini | work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi | date=31 August 2014 | accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2011, Snodgrass was called up to the squad for a friendly against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref name="leedsunited3"/&gt; He made his first start for Scotland against Denmark and also scored his first international goal in this game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/9561341.stm | work=BBC Sport | first=Martin | last=Conaghan | title=Scotland v Denmark as it happened | date=10 August 2011| accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/14481694.stm | work=BBC Sport | title=Snodgrass pleased with debut goal | date=10 August 2011 | accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2013, during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying]], he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], inflicting their first competitive defeat at home since they lost 4–1 to [[England national football team|England]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22787925 |title=Croatia 0–1 Scotland|work= BBC Sport|date= 7 June 2013|accessdate= 8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kneecap injury that Snodgrass suffered in August 2014 caused him to miss the whole of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign. He was recalled to the national squad for a friendly match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35866870 |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Scotland v Czech Republic: I'm back at my previous level – Snodgrass |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first match of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Snodgrass scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win against [[Malta national football team|Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37207612 |title=Malta 1–5 Scotland |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |first=Alasdair |last=Lamont |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Snodgrass has a daughter, Sienna, with his girlfriend Denise.&lt;ref name="McColl"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article1779973.ece |work=Times Online| title=Stirling provide the spark as Snodgrass gets back on track | first=Graham | last=McColl | date=12 May 2007|accessdate=28 May 2010}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for Snodgrass after he failed to turn up to court regarding an alleged driving offence.&lt;ref name = "arrest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/BREAKING-Arrest-warrant-out-for.6700820.jp|title=Arrest warrant out for Leeds United winger|last=Robinson|first=Paul|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Leeds United said that the non-appearance was due to a misunderstanding and that Snodgrass was working with the judicial authorities to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name = "arrest"/&gt;

On 3 March 2017, another arrest warrant was issued for him after he failed to attend his trial for allegedly driving in Glasgow with a baby being held in the arms of a passenger.

==Club career==
===Sampdoria===
Born in [[Alcalá de Henares]], in the [[Community of Madrid]],&lt;ref name=BDFutbol/&gt; Obiang began his football career playing for various teams from his home city such CD Avance, [[RSD Alcalá]] and AD Naya, where he excelled.

Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in 2008 at age 16, the minimum age that international transfer within the [[European Union]] is allowed. He was the member of ''Allievi Nazionali'' youth team in 2008–09 season, but also call-up to the first team in pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3690&amp;Itemid=38|title=Fornaroli presente, la Samp segna sei gol al Chiasso	|date=4 September 2008|accessdate=16 September 2010|work=UC Sampdoria|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an unused substitute against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and against [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]], by the decision of head coach [[Walter Mazzarri]]. In 2009–10, he was promoted to senior youth team&amp;nbsp;– [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera|Primavera]].

Primary a youth team player, Obiang also played seven times in pre-season friendlies in summer 2010, scoring two goals. After the injury crisis of the Genoese team in which the team lost midfielders [[Stefano Guberti]], [[Fernando Tissone]], [[Andrea Poli]] and [[Paolo Sammarco]], he received a call-up again from new head coach [[Domenico Di Carlo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6948&amp;Itemid=38|title=Ventuno convocati: il Pazzo ce la fa, Guberti resta a casa|date=11 September 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|work=UC Sampdoria|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his competitive debut on 12 September 2010. He substituted [[Vladimir Koman]] in the 58th minute, at that time Sampdoria losing 1–2 to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]; eventually, Sampdoria 3–3 draw at [[Stadio Olimpico di Torino]]. Obiang signed a new, five-year contract extension with Doria on the morning before the start of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6957&amp;Itemid=38|title=Il d.g. Gasparin: "Carattere e alternative di qualità"|date=12 September 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|work=UC Sampdoria|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obiang also named in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]] 25-men senior squad (list A) for play-off round and received the call-up against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6842&amp;Itemid=38|title=Poli non-ce la fa, ventidue i convocati per il Werder	|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=16 September 2010|work=UC Sampdoria|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Obiang was not named as one of players on the substitutes' bench. He also received his first call-up for [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League]] on 28 September 2010 as list B players (Under-21 youth product).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7061&amp;Itemid=38|title=Venti convocati per il Debrecen, in lista torna Tissone|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2010|work=UC Sampdoria|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his European debut on 16 December 2010 (matchday 6), with the club already eliminated before the match, a 0–2 defeat to [[Debreceni VSC|Debreceni]].

===West Ham United===
On 10 June 2015, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] announced the signing of Obiang for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/June/10-June/Hammers-obtain-Obiang? | title=Hammers obtain Obiang | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut on 15 August as a half-time substitute for [[Reece Oxford]] in a 1–2 home defeat to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Chris|title=West Ham 1–2 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33832171|accessdate=16 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Obiang was announced as West Ham's Player of the Month for October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2016/november/09-november/payet-wins-goal-month |title=Payet wins Goal of the Month |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2017, Obiang scored his first Premier League goal for ''the Hammers'' on his 55th appearance for the club, against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. The ball fell to Obiang from a corner, where he controlled, and then shot finding the bottom corner from 25 yards out.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On 20 March 2017, he was ruled out for the remainder of the [[2016–17 West Ham United F.C. season|2016–17 season]], having rolled his ankle during a home defeat by Leicester on 18 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/obiang-ruled-out-for-season/46960 |title=West Ham's Pedro Obiang ruled out for season |work=Sporting Life |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2018, Obiang was injured during an [[FA Cup]] game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. In February he underwent knee surgery and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/pedro-obiang-set-to-miss-remainder-of-the-season-after-west-ham-star-undergoes-knee-surgery-a3758236.html|title=Obiang set to miss rest of the season after knee surgery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Obiang has been capped for Spain at youth levels. Obiang received a call up for Porto International Tournament in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfef.es/index.jsp?nodo=39&amp;ID=3308 |title=Convocatoria para el Torneo Internacional de Oporto |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |work=RFEF |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517071725/http://www.rfef.es/index.jsp?nodo=39&amp;ID=3308 |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his [[Beti-Pahuin peoples#Fang|Fang]] background, the [[Gabonese Football Federation]] tried unsuccessfully to persuade Obiang to play for [[Gabon national football team|Gabon]], although both his parents and his grandparents are from [[Equatorial Guinea]]. In November 2011, they included him in a squad list for a match between [[Gabon national under-20 football team|the country's under-20]] and [[China PR national under-20 football team|China]], however he ignored the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.les-pantheres.com/site/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D1463%3Aliste-des-preselectionnes-u20-gabon-vs-chine-du-27-novembre-2011-a-libreville%26catid%3D48%3Afootball%26Itemid%3D78 |title=Liste des présélectionnés U20 (Gabon vs Chine) du 27 novembre 2011 à Libreville| accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419065232/http://www.les-pantheres.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1463:liste-des-preselectionnes-u20-gabon-vs-chine-du-27-novembre-2011-a-libreville&amp;catid=48:football&amp;Itemid=78 |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being eligible to represent [[Equatorial Guinea national football team|Equatorial Guinea]], in 2011, [[Equatoguinean Football Federation|the country's federation]] approached Obiang to enquire if he would be willing to represent the country at the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]], however Obiang declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.libertaddigital.com/deportes/futbol/2013-11-15/perico-obiang-el-sobrino-del-dictador-que-rechaza-jugar-con-guinea-ecuatorial-1276504256/|title=Perico Obiang, el sobrino del dictador que juega en la Sampdoria|publisher=Libertad Digital|date=15 November 2013|accessdate=6 September 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, after a meeting with the Equatoguinean Football Federation people, Obiang's stance on representing Equatorial Guinea appeared to have changed after showing a desire to play for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=6430|title=Reunión de la Feguifut con Perico Mba Obiang|publisher=guineaecuatorialpress.com|date=13 April 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2016, Obiang reunited in London with Equatoguinean Football Federation president Andrés Mbomio, and Equatoguinean national team head coach and coordinator [[Esteban Becker]] and [[Juvenal Edjogo-Owono]] respectively to reach an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.feguifut.org/noticia/reunion-cumbre-del-presidente-de-la-feguifut-y-pedro-obiang|title=Reunión cumbre del Presidente de la FEGUIFUT y Pedro Obiang|publisher=[[Equatoguinean Football Federation]]|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=7 October 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 2018, Obiang was officially called up for the Equatorial Guinea national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feguifut.org/noticia/convocatoria-nzalang-nacional|title=Convocatoria Nzalang Nacional|language=es|date=7 November 2018|accessdate=8 November 2018|publisher=FEGUIFUT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obiang made his debut for Equatorial Guinea in a 1–0 loss to [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] on 18 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/november/19-november/obiang-makes-equatorial-guinea-debut|title=Obiang makes Equatorial Guinea debut - West Ham United|website=www.whufc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018 he said he was "proud" to play for the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46632747&lt;/ref&gt;

He later played in [[La Liga]] for [[Elche CF|Elche]] and [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], the [[Premier League]] for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Serie A]] for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]].

A full international since 2007, Sánchez has earned over 80 caps for Colombia. He was part of the squads that reached the quarter-finals of the [[2011 Copa América]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2015 Copa América]], and finished third in the 2016 [[Copa América Centenario]].

==Club career==
===Colombia===
Born in [[Quibdó]], [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]], Sánchez moved to a football school in [[Medellín]] and then onto Uruguayan club [[Danubio F.C.|Danubio]], where he signed his first professional contract in 2003 and was a teammate of [[Edinson Cavani]].&lt;ref name=hart/&gt; However, he was released two years later, making no first-team appearances.

In the summer of 2005, Sánchez joined fellow league team [[Club Atlético River Plate (Montevideo)|River Plate Montevideo]]. He featured in 40 matches during his two-year spell, scoring once.

===Valenciennes===
In July 2007, Sánchez was bought by a group of investors and was assigned to [[Rangers de Talca]], subsequently moving abroad for the first time in his career, by agreeing to a five-year deal with [[Ligue 1]] side [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]]. He made his debut on 4 August, starting in a 3–1 home win against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]].

Sánchez featured regularly for the side in [[2007–08 Ligue 1|his debut campaign]], and was an ever-present figure during the following seasons. In March 2010, he damaged his [[anterior cruciate ligament]], being sidelined nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va-fc.com/fr/saison/breves/article/4254/Blessure-de-Carlos-Sanchez.html?pge=202 Blessure de Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Sánchez's injury)]; Valenciennes' official website, 24 March 2010 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making 148 appearances for the club, scoring 8 goals in the league, Sánchez left the club in the summer of 2012 when his contract expired. After long negotiations with [[Bolton Wanderers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bolton-scrap-carlos-sanchez-interest-1234215 Trotters aren't plonkers: Bolton abandon Sanchez chase as his price doubles]; [[Daily Mirror]], 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Ham United]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-ham-transfers-carlos-sanchez-1200870 Carlos whisper: West Ham plot cheeky swoop for Colombia's Sanchez]; Daily Mirror, 1 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; he failed to reach an agreement with any club, and subsequently rejoined his former club Valenciennes on 25 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercato365.com/infos-clubs/valenciennes/valenciennes-c-sanchez-en-pret-884835.shtml Valenciennes : C.Sanchez en prêt (Valenciennes: C.

===West Ham United===

==International career==
Sánchez made his international debut against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] on 9 May 2007. He was then included in the 34-man provisional squad for the [[Copa América 2007]], but later dropped for the final list. He was in the first team for all of [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]'s matches for [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] including the 2–1 victory over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] on 20 November 2007 in [[Bogotá]]. At the [[2011 Copa América]], he started three of Colombia's four matches as they reached the quarter-finals, coming into the team at the expense of [[Gustavo Bolívar (footballer)|Gustavo Bolívar]] after the opening game. He played in all five of Colombia's matches in the FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014, playing a defensive role which allowed [[James Rodríguez]] and [[Juan Cuadrado]] to be attacking midfielders.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;

Sánchez was included in Colombia's squad for the [[2015 Copa América]], where he was credited with "dominating" [[Neymar]] during his man of the match performance in the 1–0 group stage defeat of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/copa-america/83/blog/post/2496317/colombias-win-down-to-carlos-sanchez-dominating-neymar|title=Colombia's win down to Carlos Sanchez dominating Neymar|date=18 June 2015|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-player-watch-carlos-9478156|title=Aston Villa player watch: Carlos Sanchez dominates Neymar in man of match showing against Brazil|date=18 June 2015|work=Birmingham Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first player sent off in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], for handball in the third minute against Japan, giving away a penalty from which [[Shinji Kagawa]] opened the scoring in a 2–1 win for the Japanese; only [[José Batista]] of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] was sent off quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=10-man Colombia Beaten by Japan in Historic World Cup Win for Asia |url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/10-man-Colombia-Beaten-by-Japan-in-Historic-Win-for-Asia-20180619-0010.html |accessdate=20 June 2018 |publisher=Telesur |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sánchez received death threats for his red card, which were likened by [[BBC Sport]] to the assassination of Colombia player [[Andrés Escobar]] for his own goal at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. Manager [[José Pékerman]] dedicated the team's 3–0 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] to the suspended Sánchez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Colombia dedicate win to Carlos Sanchez after death threats against midfielder |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44601358 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark James Noble''' (born 8 May 1987) is an English [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[central midfielder]] and is captain of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He has played almost all his youth and first team football for West Ham apart from two short loan spells, at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He has played for [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-16 football team|U16]], [[England national under-17 football team|U17]], [[England national under-18 football team|U18]], [[England national under-19 football team|U19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|U21]] levels. He captained the U21 side, scoring three goals in 20 appearances. Noble is the longest serving player in West Ham's current squad, having been in the first team since 2004. He is West Ham's first-choice taker for penalty kicks and has won the club's Hammer of the Year trophy twice.

In 2014, he was ranked in the top five penalty takers in the top European leagues and was in the top 10 in the world based on the percentage of penalties successfully converted since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-should-pray-penalties-world-3209514 |title=Why England should PRAY for penalties at the World Cup&amp;nbsp;— and why we should take Mark Noble&amp;nbsp;— Mirror Online |author=Richard Beech |work=mirror |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble has played more [[Premier League]] games for West Ham than any other player.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Canning Town]], East London, Noble played for Barking Colts and moved to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s academy at age 11. His father, however, who would drive him to training, could not always arrange the time to get Noble to training sessions due to the distance from their home in [[Beckton]]. Local side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] showed an interest and Noble signed as a youth player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/west-ham-hero-noble-why-i-left-arsenal-3998604#.Uw45a8LxuM8 |title=West Ham hero Noble: Why I left Arsenal |publisher=Tribal Football |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the youngest player ever to appear in their reserve team, aged 15.&lt;ref name=whufc&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Noble Profile |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/mark-noble-west-ham_2228487_29719 |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=11 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817113941/http://www.whufc.com/articles/mark-noble-west-ham_2228487_29719 |archivedate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a trainee in July 2003&lt;ref name="sbase2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=37804 |title=Soccerbase: Mark Noble |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut in the senior team at the age of just 17 in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in August 2004 in a 2–0 win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt; He made his league debut in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in January 2005, in a 4–2 defeat away at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt; On 30 May 2005, Noble played in the [[2005 Football League Championship play-off Final]] which saw West Ham beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 1–0 to secure a return to the [[Premier League]]. He had entered the game as an 82nd-minute substitute for [[Shaun Newton]].&lt;ref name="2005pof"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4573799.stm |title=West Ham 1–0 Preston |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|We think very highly of Mark.

Upon West Ham's return to the Premier League, he featured in only five League games in the [[2005–06 West Ham United F.C. season|2005–06 season]], including those against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 20 November 2005 and against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 27 November, but after a game against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 10 December, he found regular playing time harder to come by and was sent out on loan. He did not play for West Ham at all in 2006.&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whustats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=802&amp;united=Mark_Noble |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Mark Noble |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan periods====
Noble was subsequently loaned to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/4674790.stm |title=Noble joins Hull for three months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made five appearances.&lt;ref name=sbase2 /&gt; His Hull debut came on 18 February 2006 in a 1–0 away defeat by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4703636.stm |title=Cardiff 1–0 Hull |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble's loan ended early after he suffered an injury to his lower back.&lt;ref name=indie&gt;[http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article2491790.ece ''"Mark Noble: Claret and blue, through and through"''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171242/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article2491790.ece |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''The Independent on Sunday'', 17 June 2007. Retrieved 17 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble signed a three-month loan with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in August 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/4786277.stm |title=''"Noble and Walton sign for Ipswich"'' |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope of gaining necessary first-team experience. He played 13 games in the Championship and scored his first professional goal on 12 September in a 2–1 home win over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/5330028.stm |title=Ipswich 2–1 Coventry |publisher=BBC |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to West Ham===
Noble scored his first goal for West Ham against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], the side's first of three in a 3–0 home win in January 2007 in the third round of the [[FA Cup]], from an assist by [[Carlos Tevez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6214031.stm |title=West Ham 3–0 Brighton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Lyon, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March, he scored his first Premiership goal and the opening goal of the game, against Tottenham at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] in a game West Ham eventually lost 4–3 in the final seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6392467.stm |title=West Ham 3–4 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Fletcher, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Ham United v Tottenham Hotspur, 04 March 2007 |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/west-ham-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-04-march-2007-277158/ |publisher=www.11v11.com |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 11 games in all competitions, scoring three goals in the [[2006–07 West Ham United F.C. season|2006–07 season]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

====2007–08 season====
Noble established his place in [[Alan Curbishley]]'s side during the [[2007–08 West Ham United F.C. season|2007–08 season]], starting nearly all games when fit. He scored his first penalty for the club on 18 August 2007 in a 1–0 away win against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] after [[Colin Doyle (footballer)|Colin Doyle]] had fouled [[Craig Bellamy]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6941856.stm |title=Birmingham 0–1 West Ham United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Sanghera, Mandeep}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was out for several weeks in November 2007 after he had played through an injury for the last several months without letting the medical staff know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Naive" Noble out for two weeks |url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/archive/2007/11/09/West+Ham+%28westham%29/1822042._Naive__Noble_out_for_two_weeks/ |publisher=[[Waltham Forest Guardian]] |date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, Noble scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool from the penalty spot, after Liverpool defender [[Jamie Carragher]] had brought down [[Freddie Ljungberg]] in the last few seconds of second-half added time. His performance in the match was described as "exceptional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7210594.stm |title=West Ham United 1–0 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Chowdhury, Saj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
The [[2008–09 West Ham United F.C. season|2008–09 season]] did not start well for Noble, as he was sent off for two bookable offences in a 3–0 loss away at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], the first away game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: Manchester City vs West Ham United |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=246349&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ENG.1 |publisher=[[ESPN|espn.com]] |date=24 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604124920/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=246349 |archivedate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving his suspension he came back to score an equaliser against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] after West Ham went a goal down with West Brom coming back to win 3–2. This was one of five goals he scored in the season with three coming from the penalty spot.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; After Alan Curbishley left in September, he remained in the first team under new manager [[Gianfranco Zola]]. He celebrated his 100th appearance for the Hammers by scoring against Blackburn at [[Ewood Park]] on 21 March 2009 to secure a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1598273,00.html Ton-up Noble earns draw]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322232131/http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C12562~1598273%2C00.html |date=22 March 2009 }}  www.whufc.com&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he signed a contract extension tying him to the club until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duo hammer out new deals |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1616190,00.html |publisher=PremierLeague.com |date=7 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411060622/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~1616190%2C00.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10 season====
Noble began the [[2009–10 West Ham United F.C. season|2009–10 season]] well, scoring West Ham's first goal of the new season, in a 2–0 win over Premier League newcomers Wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/15/premier-league-wolves-west-ham-united |title=Premier League: Wolves 0–2 West Ham United |author=Mikey Stafford |work=the Guardian |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Gianfranco Zola, Noble established himself in central midfield in a diamond that included [[Scott Parker (footballer)|Scott Parker]] as his partner and [[Jack Collison]] and [[Valon Behrami]] on the wings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfordrecorder.co.uk/content/west_ham_united_football_club/story.aspx?brand=REConline&amp;category=hammers&amp;tBrand=RECONLINE&amp;tCategory=HAMMERSNEW&amp;itemid=WeED28%20Oct%202009%2016%3A31%3A15%3A183 Jack's a part of the precious diamond]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would only score one other goal during the season&amp;nbsp;– a penalty after [[Habib Beye]] had fouled [[Zavon Hines]]&amp;nbsp;– in a 2–1 home win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 4 November 2009.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8334228.stm |title=West Ham 2–1 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Roopanarine, Les}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
With West Ham now managed by [[Avram Grant]], Noble continued to be a regular member of the first team. He played 26 of a possible 38 games in the Premier League missing a month of the season after an [[appendectomy]] as West Ham were relegated after finishing in 20th and bottom place.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-c832675194b64f0c8329bba43a451023.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043658/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-c832675194b64f0c8329bba43a451023.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=West Ham midfielder Noble out after appendectomy |agency=Associated Press |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored four league goals, all were penalties including two in one game.

'''Javier Hernández Balcázar''' ({{IPA-es|xaˈβjeɾ eɾˈnandez βalˈkasaɾ|-|JavierHernandezBalcazarPronunciation.ogg}};{{efn|In isolation, ''Hernández'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|eɾˈnandes|}}.}} born 1 June 1988) is a Mexican professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]]. Hernández is commonly known by his nickname, '''Chicharito''' ({{IPA-es|tʃitʃaˈɾito|}}; [[Mexican Spanish]]: ''little [[pea]]''), which he wears on his shirt.

Hernández began his career in 2006, playing for Mexican club [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. In July 2010, he became the first Mexican player to join [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], scoring 20 goals and winning the Premier League in his [[2010–11 Premier League|debut season]]. After falling out of favour under managers [[David Moyes]] and [[Louis van Gaal]], he spent the 2014–15 season on loan at [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. In August 2015, Hernández signed for [[Bundesliga]] club [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]. After two seasons in Germany, Hernández returned to the Premier League and joined West Ham United. His minutes-per-goal ratio is among the most prolific in the history of the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name="goal ratio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/gallery/111326 |title=Best goal ratios of Premier League players |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hernández was born in [[Guadalajara]], Jalisco and first played in a recreation league when he was seven years old. Hernández lived in [[Morelia]], [[Michoacán]] for over four years while his father, footballer [[Javier Hernández (footballer, born 1961)|Javier "''Chícharo''" Hernández]], played for [[Monarcas Morelia]].&lt;ref name="Morelia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/la-zanahoria-de-el-chicharito |title=La Zanahoria de el Chicharito |website=''Zocalo.com.mx'' |publisher=Zócalo |language=Spanish |date=15 January 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Morelia, Hernández attended elementary school at the ''Instituto Piaget'' where he studied from third to sixth grade and played for the school's football team.&lt;ref name="Morelia"/&gt;

At the age of nine, Hernández joined [[C.D.

===Manchester United===
====Transfer====
[[File:Chicharito.ogv|thumb|Hernández on his Manchester United debut]]
[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were first made aware of Hernández in October 2009; a scout went to Mexico that December and reported positively after watching a few games. Because of Hernández's age, the club originally planned to wait before making a move to sign him, but his potential involvement with the national team at the World Cup rushed the club into making a bid. United's chief scout, Jim Lawlor, was sent to Mexico for three weeks in February and March to watch Hernández and filed another positive report on him, before the club solicitor went over to Mexico to finalise the paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Boss: We had to move fast |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Boss-We-had-to-move-fast.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2010, Hernández agreed a deal to sign for Manchester United for an undisclosed fee, subject to a work permit application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Communications Dept. |title=Reds agree Hernandez deal |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Reds-agree-Hernandez-deal.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous day, Hernández had been present at Manchester United's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-final win over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Chicharito's 'dream' move |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Chicharitos-dream-move.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was conducted in complete secrecy; Hernández's agent was kept in the dark, as was his grandfather [[Tomás Balcázar]], who thought Hernández was going on a trip to [[Atlanta]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Duncan |last=White |title=Javier Hernandez, aka El Chicharito, living the Manchester United dream |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/7578217/Javier-Hernandez-aka-El-Chicharito-living-the-Manchester-United-dream.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Tom |last1=Marshall |first2=Steve |last2=Bartram |title=United's covert operation |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Jun/Uniteds-covert-operation.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal, United played a friendly against Chivas to open the Mexican club's [[Estadio Chivas|new stadium]] on 30 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Marshall |title=Manchester United to play Chivas at new stadium |url=http://guadalajarareporter.com/sports-mainmenu-89/26618-manchester-united-set-guadalajara-date.html |website=Guadalajara Reporter |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711132837/http://guadalajarareporter.com/sports-mainmenu-89/26618-manchester-united-set-guadalajara-date.html |archivedate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, the work permit was granted, allowing the transfer to be made official on 1 July.&lt;ref name="mu"&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Tuck |title=Chicharito granted work permit |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/May/Chicharito-granted-permit.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernández made his United debut on 28 July, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for [[Nani]] in the [[2010 MLS All-Star Game]] at the [[NRG Stadium]], Houston; he scored his first goal for the club 18 minutes later, lobbing the ball over [[Nick Rimando]] from just outside the area after a long through-ball from [[Darren Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=MLS All-Stars 2 United 5 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2010/Jul/MLS-AllStars-2-United-5.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Hernández scored against Manchester United while playing in a friendly for his old club, Chivas; he started the game in a Chivas jersey and scored after just eight minutes.

====Real Madrid (loan)====
On 1 September 2014, Hernández signed for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] on a season-long loan deal, with an option of a purchase at the end of the loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 September 2014 |title=Real Madrid sign Javier Hernández on loan from Manchester United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/01/javier-hernandez-real-madrid-manchester-united-loan |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent a medical and signed the contract that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicharito Hernández signs his contract with Real Madrid |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/en/news/2014/09/chicharito-hernandez-signs-his-contract-with-real-madrid |publisher=Real Madrid C.F. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut in the [[Madrid derby]] on 13 September, replacing [[Karim Benzema]] for the final 27 minutes as the team lost 2–1 at home to [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid 1–2 Atl Madrid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29176277 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, Hernández came on as a 77th-minute substitute for [[Gareth Bale]] and scored his first two goals in an 8–2 away win against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29275785 |title=Deportivo de La Coruña 2–8 Real Madrid |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent exit from Manchester United====
On 29 August 2015, it was reported that Manchester United manager [[Louis Van Gaal]] had told Hernández he could leave the club before the closure of the transfer window. Although with one year of his contract still remaining, it was unclear with scale of transfer fee United would demand for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Jason |title=Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal tells Javier Hernandez he is free to leave |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11832741/Manchester-United-manager-Louis-van-Gaal-tells-Javier-Hernandez-he-is-free-to-leave.html |accessdate=18 September 2018 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A clinical goalscorer, Hernández has been described as a "goal-poacher", due to a number of his goals being scored from close-range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Javier Hernández and the best tap-in merchants |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8385881/Javier-Hernandez-and-the-best-ever-tap-in-merchants.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf9"&gt;{{cite web |title=The False 9: Javier Hernandez – Rebirth of the Poacher? |url=http://www.thefalse9.com/2011/06/javier-hernandez-modern-day-poacher-in.html |website=The False 9 |access-date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His movement off the ball, pace, and ability to find space inside the box has also been praised.&lt;ref name="tf9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |date=16 March 2011 |title=Sir Alex Ferguson hails form of Javier Hernández for Manchester United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/16/alex-ferguson-javier-hernandez-manchester-united |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as one of the few players who seem capable of appearing behind a defender's back to knock in the ball from two yards, with his playing style being compared to that of German striker [[Miroslav Klose]].&lt;ref name="Christenson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Christenson |first=Marcus |title=Javier Hernández and the underrated art of the clinical goalscorer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/02/javier-hernandez-goalscorer-bayer-leverkusen-tottenham-champions-league-miroslav-klose |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudi Völler]], sporting director of Bayer Leverkusen, has praised Hernández for his keen positioning in front of goal, saying: "he certainly doesn't win every tackle but he has an incredible sense of where the ball will end up".&lt;ref name="Christenson" /&gt; Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] described Hernández as two-footed, very quick, in possession of a good spring, and a natural goalscorer. Ferguson also said Hernández's style reminds him of former United striker [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] – the so-called "baby-faced assassin" who scored the injury time winner against Bayern Munich in United's 1999 Champions League triumph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/premier-league/javier-hernandez-bliver-den-nye-solskjaer Javier Hernandez bliver den nye Solskjær] {{dk icon}} Tipsbladet, 1 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández's former teammate [[Jesús Padilla]] described him as "amazing in the air" despite his height.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;
Due to his small stature, he is extremely quick and agile, also possessing good technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/2590455/javier-hernandez-signs-for-bayer-leverkusen-from-man-united |title=Javier Hernandez signs for Bayer Leverkusen from Manchester United |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Richard Jolly |date=31 August 2015|access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2016 interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hernández commented on his abilities inside the penalty area, describing the intuition he has in knowing where an impending cross will fall from a teammate and outsmarting opposing defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the churning mind of Mexico's Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/05/31/chicharito-mexico-javier-hernandez-bayer-leverkusen |website=Sports Illustrated |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Mexico national team coach [[Juan Carlos Osorio]] described Hernández as having "a knack for the goal. Sometimes it seems like every rebound or every deflection goes into his path. Another thing is he doesn't dwell on a missed opportunity. He always looks forward to the next one. He has good ability in the air. He has good pace, and he makes those diagonal runs starting from the first defender in behind the second one. He also has the willingness to work defensively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Masters of Modern Soccer: Chicharito and the Art of Mexico's Synchronization |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/05/03/chicharito-javier-hernandez-mexico-juan-carlos-osorio-masters-modern-soccer |website=Sports Illustrated |first=Grant |last=Wahl |date=3 May 2018 |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
While growing up in La Gavotte Peyret, Nasri grew an attraction to the sport of [[association football|football]] at a young age.&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt; He regularly played the sport on the [[street football|streets]] where he learned many of his skills. Upon noticing his prodigious talent, his parents signed him up to play with the local club in his hometown. Nasri spent one year playing with the club in La Gavotte Peyret before moving to Pennes Mirabeau in nearby [[Les Pennes-Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] at age seven. While playing with Pennes, Nasri was discovered by [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] scout Freddy Assolen, who had been informed of the player's talent through local [[word of mouth]].&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.om.net/en/Saison/101002/Actualites/32981/Samir_Nasri_to_play_his_100th|title=Samir Nasri to play his 100th!|publisher=[[Olympique de Marseille]]|date=10 November 2007|accessdate=18 March 2011|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405021025/http://www.om.net/en/Saison/101002/Actualites/32981/Samir_Nasri_to_play_his_100th|archivedate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After noticing Nasri's skill in person, Assolen recruited the player to travel with a group of other young players to Italy to participate in a youth tournament where they would play against the youth academies of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Nasri impressed at the tournament and Assolen was jokingly told by a Milan scout that "he [Nasri] stays here, you leave him".&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt; After returning to France, Marseille officials organized a meeting with the player's father and the group agreed to allow Nasri insertion into the club's academy at the age of nine.

=== Olympique de Marseille ===

In fact, I wasn't even sure whether he was left or right-footed." |source= &lt;small&gt;Freddy Assolen, upon noticing Nasri's skill at the age of nine.&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; &lt;/small&gt; }}

Upon entering the Marseille youth academy, Nasri quickly impressed. Upon moving to [[Bastide]], where the club's youth players reside, his style of play began to take shape. In 2007, Nasri admitted that the move to Bastide really helped his game, stating, "That's where I really started to progress. Training was different and the facilities are beautiful, all of which helps you work well."&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; As a result of his quick progression, Nasri was an integral part of every youth team he was a part of winning several trophies, such as the Championnat de Provence, Coupe de Provence, and the Ligue de la Méditerranée. After spending most of the 2003–04 season playing with the club's under-18 team, for the latter part of the season, the now 16-year-old Nasri was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth division of [[Football in France|French football]]. He appeared primarily as a substitute in a few matches during the campaign as the reserve team failed to rebound from its bad start to the season, which resulted in a 16th-place finish and relegation to the [[Championnat de France amateur 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20304.htm|title=Olympique Marseille Reserve Pro: Saison Football 2003/2004|work=Stat2Foot|date=|accessdate=18 March 2011|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617131754/http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20304.htm#|archive-date=17 June 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debut season ====
Ahead of the [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05 season]], several clubs were reported to be interested in signing Nasri, most notably English clubs [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_2337629,00.html|title=Gunners join Nasri hunt |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=31 May 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to decrease the speculation, Nasri was offered a three-year professional contract by Marseille officials led by president [[Pape Diouf]] and manager [[José Anigo]]. On 13 August 2004, Nasri agreed to the contract. Marseille officials had been eager to sign Nasri to a contract in an attempt to not undergo a situation similar to the departure of [[Mathieu Flamini]], in which the player departed the club without Marseille receiving any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11669_2323845,00.html|title=L'OM starlet in demand |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=14 January 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his professional contract, Nasri was promoted to the senior team by Anigo and assigned the number 22 shirt. He began the season playing on the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning a call up to the senior team in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20405.htm|title=Olympique Marseille Reserve Pro: Saison Football 2004/2005|work=Stat2Foot|date=|accessdate=22 March 2011|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402031819/http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20405.htm#|archive-date=2 April 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasri made his professional debut on 12 September in a 2–0 league defeat to [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], appearing as a substitute for [[Bruno Cheyrou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49233|title=Sochaux v. Marseille Match Report|publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |date=12 September 2004 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October, he made his first professional start playing the entire match in a 1–1 draw with [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48917|title=Marseille v.

In the team's first match following the winter break, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 away victory over [[Lille OSC|Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49211|title=Lille v. Marseille Match Report|publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri finished his rookie campaign with 25 total appearances, one goal and two assists.

==== 2005–06 season ====

[[File:Samir Nasri in Moscow.jpg|200px|upright|thumb|left|Nasri taking a corner during his time with Marseille.]]

The [[2005–06 Ligue 1|2005–06 season]] saw Marseille boosted by the arrival of attackers [[Franck Ribéry]] and [[Djibril Cissé]], the latter arriving after having a successful loan stint with the club the previous season. Nasri, who was now given a more prominent role within the team by new manager [[Jean Fernandez]], formed impressive partnerships with the two along with lead [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Mamadou Niang]].&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; He appeared in 49 total matches, which included appearances in both the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Nasri made his European debut on 16 July 2005 in the first round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]] against Swiss club [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. Marseille won the first leg 3–2. In the second leg, Nasri scored his first European goal in a 2–1 win. Marseille ultimately won the competition after beating Spanish outfit [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] 5–3 on aggregate. In the league, Nasri appeared in 30 matches, 25 as a starter. He scored his only league goal of the season on 29 April 2007 in a 4–2 win over Sochaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50817|title=Marseille v.

Nasri appeared as a substitute in the match as Marseille were defeated 2–1. Following the season, Nasri signed a two-year contract extension with the club until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_2343857,00.html|title=l'OM starlets sign on |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2006–07 season ====
Nasri began the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]] playing under [[Albert Emon]], his fourth different manager in three years. Despite this, Marseille's now heightened popularity saw increased speculation from writers and supporters that the club would finally win its first league title since the [[1991–92 French Division 1|1991–92 season]]. Nasri began the season on a quick note scoring the second goal in the team's 3–1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50565|title=Paris Saint-Germain v.

However, Sochaux recorded an upset victory defeating Marseille 5–4 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] after the match ended 2–2 following extra time. On the final match day of the season, Nasri converted the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[CS Sedan Ardennes|Sedan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50846|title=Marseille v.

Nasri finished the season with a career-high 50 appearances, 37 of them in the league. For his efforts, he was awarded the [[National Union of Professional Footballers|UNFP]] [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award and named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]].&lt;ref name="nasri_honours"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/samir-nasri-my-reasons-for-joining-arsenal|title=Samir Nasri – My reasons for joining Arsenal |publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri was also voted the Club Player of the Year by supporters, receiving 62% of the votes ahead of the likes of Ribéry and Niang.&lt;ref name="nasri_honours"/&gt;

==== 2007–08 season ====

[[File:SamirNasri.jpg|175px|upright|thumb|right|Nasri with Marseille in 2008.]]

Similar to his previous three years at Marseille, Nasri began the new season under new management as the club was now being led by the Belgian [[Eric Gerets]]. Due to the departure of Ribéry to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Gerets installed Nasri as the focal point of the attack and he responding by having his best season at the club. He appeared in 42 total matches scoring a career-high six goals and also assisting on a career-high 15 goals. Nasri formed partnerships in the midfield with winger [[Mathieu Valbuena]] and [[midfielders]] [[Lorik Cana]] and [[Benoît Cheyrou]] as Marseille boasted the third-best attack in the league behind champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], who finished first and second in the league respectively. Initially, Nasri struggled during the infancy of the campaign due to dealing with the effects of a severely sprained ankle suffered in the pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11810_2595419,00.html|title=L'OM relief at Nasri news |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to score a goal or provide an assist in the team's first eight league matches. On 24 November 2007, he assisted on two goals in a 2–0 victory over [[FC Metz|Metz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51412|title=Marseille v.

Following the winter break, Nasri's goal-scoring began to take form. In late January, he scored goals in back-to-back matches against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] and [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51469|title=Nancy v.

In November 2008, Nasri was one of a group of young players who were accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at Euro 2008. The accusation came from domestic teammate [[William Gallas]], who made the charge in his autobiography. Though not explicitly named in the book, Nasri was widely identified as the player in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/outspoken-gallas-loses-captaincy-1029711.html|title=Outspoken Gallas loses captaincy |date=22 November 2008 |work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=19 March 2011 |first=Jason |last=Burt}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of Nasri's disrespectful attitude, Gallas cited an incident in which the young player sat in Thierry Henry's seat on the team bus and refused to move, which, according to Gallas, undermined the striker's seniority.

In the 2008–09 season, Nasri appeared in only three matches with the national team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost a year and a half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="nasri_world"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6026938,00.html|title=Nasri fears for WC spot |date=14 March 2010 |publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|accessdate=19 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8676453.stm|title=France keep uncapped pair in trimmed World Cup squad|date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I told myself I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one."&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt;

In his early years at Marseille, Nasri was deployed in several positions, most notably as a [[deep-lying midfielder]] and a [[wide midfielder]] primarily on the right side as he was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"&gt;{{cite news|title= Samir Nasri: the new Zidane?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/23/europeanfootball.marseille|date=23 March 2007 |first=Paul|last=Doyle |work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of developing his physical traits, in the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]], manager [[Albert Emon]] inserted Nasri into the [[playmaker]] role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"/&gt; Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a [[central attacking midfielder]] at both club and international level.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"/&gt; The player has personally said that playing centrally is his preference.&lt;ref name="nasri_world"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/9415207.stm | title = Arsenal star Samir Nasri primed for Barcelona challenge  | date = 7 March 2011 |publisher=BBC | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=831364&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5901 | title = Nasri wants to be central figure at Arsenal | date = 11 October 2010 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5813481/5-key-questions-international-friendlies | title = (Not-so-) friendly fire | date = 22 November 2010 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/nasri | title = Wenger – My creative stars are versatile | date = 8 February 2009 | publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His close control with the ball, speed, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]], [[Cross (football)|crossing]], and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former [[Captain (association football)|club captain]] [[Cesc Fàbregas]].

In 2009, in order to accommodate the arrival of Russian attacker Andrey Arshavin, it was recommended by both Wenger and then-France national team coach Raymond Domenech that Nasri revert to his role as a deep-lying midfielder so the player could showcase his underrated defensive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_5283401,00.html | title = Nasri set for defensive role | date = 5 May 2009 | work=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri is also an underrated direct free kick and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] taker. The player had previously developed a [[superstition]] with regards to taking spot kicks, but conquered the issue after successfully converting two penalties in the team's League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/8017749/Arsenals-Samir-Nasri-dived-for-penalty-in-Carling-Cup-says-Tottenham-manager-Harry-Redknapp.html | title = Arsenal's Samir Nasri dived for penalty in Carling Cup, says Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp | date = 22 September 2010 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate =19 March 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenger describes Nasri as a "young, quick and technically outstanding player".&lt;ref name="nasri_arsenal"/&gt; He is described in a similar fashion by club scout [[Gilles Grimandi]], who stated that Nasri is "a fantastic athlete, he's quick, flexible and good with his feet".&lt;ref name="nasri_scout"/&gt; Nasri's playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref name="nasri_zidane"/&gt; After joining Arsenal and excelling on the wing, the English media began comparing him to former club player and compatriot [[Robert Pires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/3407741/Arsene-Wenger-finds-his-new-Robert-Pires-in-dazzling-Samir-Nasri-Football.html | title = Arsene Wenger finds his new Robert Pires in dazzling Samir Nasri | date = 8 November 2008 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate =19 March 2011 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Barclay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Andrew Garry Wilshere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|ʃ|ər}}; born 1 January 1992) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Wilshere came up through [[Arsenal F.C. Academy|Arsenal's youth academy]] and impressed from an early age. He made his first-team debut in 2008, becoming Arsenal's youngest ever league debutant at the age of 16 years, 256 days. Wilshere has earned a number of accolades including the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award, selection to the 2010–11 [[PFA Team of the Year]], and Arsenal's Player of the Season award, as voted for by fans for his performances in his first full campaign for Arsenal during the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]].

Wilshere is an England international, having previously represented his country at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels. He made his debut for the senior team against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at the age of 18 years and 222 days, making him the 12th youngest debutant in England's history.

'''Andriy Mykolayovych Yarmolenko''' ({{lang-uk|Андрій Миколайович Ярмоленко}}; born 23 October 1989) is a Ukrainian [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] or [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for English {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine national team]].

Yarmolenko has been a full international for Ukraine since 2009, scoring 36 goals in 79 matches and playing at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
Yarmolenko's parents, native Ukrainians, were originally from [[Kulykivka Raion]], [[Chernihiv Oblast]]. After marrying, his mother was offered a job in Leningrad (now [[Saint Petersburg]]), Russian SFSR, and moved there, later joined by her husband. Shortly after the birth of Andriy, the family moved back to their native land, to the city of [[Chernihiv]].&lt;ref name="uaftbl-3"&gt;[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/458ab04c.html Андрей Ярмоленко: "Для академии "Динамо" был слаб" (Andriy Yarmolenko: I was too weak for Dynamo Kievs's youth academy)] interview with Lyudmila Rusanova of ''Komanda'' {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Yarmolenko is a pupil of the [[Chernihiv]] youth system. He joined the [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] Youth Academy at age 13. However, he returned to Chernihiv after a year, unable to endure the physical demands of training.&lt;ref name="uaftbl-3"/&gt; At the start of his professional career, he played at local clubs [[FC Polissya Zhytomyr|Polissia]] and [[FC Desna Chernihiv|Desna Chernihiv]] before joining Dynamo again.

===Dynamo Kyiv===
In December 2006, Yarmolenko signed a five-year contract with Ukrainian giants, Dynamo Kyiv, where he joined its second team, [[FC Dynamo-2 Kyiv|Dynamo-2]], which plays in lower leagues, for a couple of seasons. The talented youngster was praised as the "new [[Andriy Shevchenko|Sheva]]" by journalists, who noted his qualities of good physique, shot and especially his speed. The then vice-president of Dynamo, [[Yozhef Sabo]], also praised the youngster, saying, "Yarmolenko has all the makings to become a top-level player."&lt;ref name="uaftbl-1"&gt;[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/4587b2c9.html Андрей Ярмоленко перешел в "Динамо" (Andriy Yarmolenko moved to "Dynamo")] article on ua-football.com {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uaftbl-2"&gt;[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/4587b2c9.html Уже не "Шева", а "Блохин" (Now not "Sheva", but "Blokhin")] article on ua-football.com {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2008, Yarmolenko debuted for Dynamo's first team in an away match against [[FC Vorskla Poltava|Vorskla Poltava]] and scored the winning goal in Kyiv's 1–2 victory.&lt;ref name="uaftbl-4"&gt;[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/4827e464.html Андрей Ярмоленко: "Мне просто повезло" (Andriy Yarmolenko: I was lucky)] interview with Dynamo's website {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 7 goals in 21 games in his first season and 11 in 19 in his second. He is now regularly used as a left or centre forward.

====Rivalry with Taras Stepanenko====
In a match in October 2015, Yarmolenko committed a dangerous challenge which almost broke [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] player [[Taras Stepanenko]]'s leg. The two reconciled after the game and exchanged jerseys, but afterwards Yarmolenko threw Stepanenko's shirt on the ground while he thanked the Dynamo fans. In the
Shakhtar–Dynamo derby in April 2016, after the former won 3–0, Stepanenko stepped in front of the Dynamo fans kissing his Shakhtar badge. In a brawl that escalated, Yarmolenko kicked Stepanenko to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2863955/shakhtar-and-dynamo-kiev-rivalry-could-hurt-ukraine-chances-at-euro-2016|title=Shakhtar and Dynamo Kiev rivalry could hurt Ukraine at Euro 2016 |date=4 May 2016|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=[[ESPNFC]]|author=Michael Yokhin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borussia Dortmund===
On 28 August 2017, Yarmolenko signed a four-year contract with [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41074287|title=Andriy Yarmolenko: Borussia Dortmund sign Ukraine striker on four-year deal |date=28 August 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2017, Yarmolenko made his debut for Dortmund as a substitute in the 79 minute against Freiburg. He then got his first start for Dortmund against [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in a Champions League fixture, where he scored Dortmund's only goal in the 3–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/908045069705289728|title=Yarmolenko got Dortmund back in it with a fantastic curler! #UCL|date=13 September 2017|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=[[Fox Soccer]]}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===

On 2 September 2011, in an international friendly against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in [[Kharkiv]], Yarmolenko set a national team record by scoring 14 seconds into the match, the fastest time in which a Ukraine national team player has scored a goal.

Yarmolenko scored a hat-trick on 15 November 2014, netting all of Ukraine's goals in a 3–0 victory away to [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yarmolenko hat-trick eases Ukraine past Luxembourg|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013900/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|publisher=UEFA|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Yarmolenko scored in both legs of Ukraine's 3–1 [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying play-offs|play-off]] victory over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] to qualify the nation for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] final stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000447/match=2018083/index.html|title=Ukraine survive Slovenia onslaught|date=17 November 2015|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yarmolenko was subsequently included in Ukraine's squad for Euro 2016, where he played in all three matches as Ukraine failed to score and finished [[UEFA Euro 2016#Group C|bottom of the group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/sport/ukraine-ends-participation-in-euro-2016-by-defeat-to-poland-416885.html|title=Ukraine ends participation in Euro 2016 by defeat to Poland|date=22 June 2016|work=Kyiv Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Torino===
Ogbonna began his early career in the youth set-up of [[A.S.D. Nuova Cassino 1924|Cassino]], where he played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]]. In 2002, he was noticed by [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], which, on the recommendation of [[Antonio Comi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torinogranata.it/?action=read&amp;idnotizia=23207|title=Comi "consiglia" la Roma ad Ogbonna|publisher=torinogranata.it|author= Marina Beccuti|date=30 August 2011|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought him for €3,000 and assigned him to their youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=10690860 |title=Ogbonna, questione di testa |publisher=La Stampa |author=Pietro Ivaldi |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |page=43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110003838/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=10690860 |archivedate=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006–07 season he was regularly called up to the first team and on 11 February 2007 he made his debut in [[Serie A]] at age 18, against [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] (1–2), as a starter under coach [[Alberto Zaccheroni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=7508358 |title=Il Toro ai raggi X |publisher=La Stampa |author=Roberto Condio |date=12 February 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2010 |page=53 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110001946/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=7508358 |archivedate=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of season he totalled 4 league appearances.

The following August he moved on loan to [[F.C. Crotone|Crotone]] in [[Serie C1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/1707/61/ |title=Cioffi all'Ascoli, Ogbonna al Crotone |publisher=torinofc.it |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906034959/http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/1707/61/ |archivedate=6 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making 22 league appearances in the league and narrowly earning promotion to [[Serie B]], lost in the semi-final play-offs.

In the [[2008–09 Serie A]] season he returned to Torino, collecting 19 league appearances and four in [[2008–09 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]]. Torino, however, were relegated to [[Serie B]] at the end of the season. Starting from 2009, after the relegation of the club to Serie B, he earned his place as a starter for the ''Granata''. On 17 April 2010, Ogbonna scored his first goal for Torino in the match against [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]], finishing 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/6268/61/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 July 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913044038/http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/6268/61/ |archive-date=13 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2010, in the second round of [[2010–11 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] against [[Cosenza Calcio 1914 (2008)|Cosenza]] (won 3–1 in extra time), he wore the [[Captain (association football)|captain]]'s armband for the first time. In three Serie B seasons with Torino, Ogbonna made 105 appearances, helping the club return to Serie A after finishing second to [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]] during the [[2011-12 Serie B|2011–12 season]].

On 2 February 2012, he renewed his contract with Torino until 30 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/9523/61/|title=OGBONNA RINNOVA FINO AL 2016|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=9 February 2012|work=Torino FC|language=Italian|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209104728/http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/9523/61/|archive-date=9 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2013, Ogbonna underwent a medical at [[Turin]]'s Fornaca, Isokinetic and the Istituto di Medicina dello Sport ahead of his proposed cross-town move to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/ogbonna_medical|title=Ogbonna completes Juventus medical|work=Juventus.com|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the medical, he officially signed for Juventus for a transfer fee of €13 million, with an additional €2 million to be paid in future bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/ogbonna_juventus_transfer|title=Ogbonna signs for Juventus|work=Juventus.com|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first player to become [[captain (association football)|captain]] of the ''Granata'' and transfer to rivals Juventus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2013/07/10/ogbonna-capitano-granata-che-volle-farsi-juventino.html|title=Ogbonna, capitano granata che volle farsi juventino|work=Archivio&amp;nbsp;— la Repubblica.it|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking much dislike with his old supporters of Torino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.panorama.it/calcio/juventus-torino-ogbonna|title="Gobbonna"?

He made his Champions League debut in on 17 September 2013, against [[F.C.

Ogbonna | publisher=Soccerway | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season, despite being behind [[Andrea Barzagli]], [[Leonardo Bonucci]] and [[Giorgio Chiellini]] in the pecking order at centre back, Ogbonna managed 25 appearances in all competitions, mostly starting in matches in the latter half of the season as the team was heavily rotated for league, Coppa Italia and Champions League matches. Ogbonna played 16 league games for Juventus in the [[2013–14 Serie A|2013–14 season]], as they won Serie A title.&lt;ref name=soccerway/&gt; He was also a member of the side which won the [[2013 Supercoppa Italiana]]&lt;ref name=soccerway/&gt; In the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15]] season, Juventus defended the Serie A title once again, with Ogbonna making 25 league appearances, and the [[2014–15 Coppa Italia]].&lt;ref name=soccerway/&gt; On 6 June 2015, he was an unused substitute as Juventus lost the [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League Final]] 3–1 to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=soccerway/&gt;

In April and May 2015, interest from [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/35383/massuaku-in-roma-shortlist/|title=Masuaku in Roma shortlist|date=8 May 2015|publisher=www.sdna.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.football-italia.net/65807/inter-enquire-masuaku|title=Inter enquire for Masuaku|date=29 April 2015|publisher=www.football-italia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; His agent, Roger Henrotay, however stated a renewal of Masuaku's contract was on the cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/37267/masuaku-set-for-new-olympiakos-contract/|title=Masuaku set for new Olympiakos contract|date=16 May 2015|publisher=www.sdna.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, a reported €4 million offer for Masuaku including former Olympiacos midfielder [[Giannis Fetfatzidis]] from [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] was rejected by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.calciomercato.com/news/genoa-su-masuaku-il-rifiuto-non-spaventa-preziosi-279888|title=Genoa su Masuaku: la trattativa |date=15 July 2015|publisher=www.calciomercato.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio's strong form in Forest's first five league matches of the season, in which he contributed three goals and three assists, led to him being named as a candidate for the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|Championship's]] Player of the Month award for August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Red recognition |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/manager-of-the-month-august-1896555.aspx |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio lost out on the award to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton's]] [[Igor Vetokele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Bet Player of the Month 2014/15 |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/PlayeroftheMonth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316222734/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/PlayeroftheMonth |dead-url=yes |archivedate=16 March 2011 |publisher=The Football League |accessdate=21 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio started every league match for Forest during his first season with the club, scoring 14 goals, and was named Forest's Player of the Season on 4 May 2015.&lt;ref name=potynffc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/antonio-scoops-top-prize-2439208.aspx|title=Antonio scoops top prize|publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He celebrated by lying on his side and spinning in a circle, imitating a celebration by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' character [[Homer Simpson]] in the episode "[[Last Exit to Springfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dutton|first=Tom|title=Michail Antonio celebration: Watch West Ham star perform Homer Simpson dance move after scoring|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/michail-antonio-celebration-watch-west-ham-star-perform-bizarre-dance-move-after-scoring-a3190711.html|accessdate=28 February 2016|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his next appearance, Antonio turned-in a [[Man of the match]] performance, scoring the only goal in a home win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35647651 | title=West Ham United 1–0 Tottenham Hotspur | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with another goal in a 3–2 away win at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] three days later as West Ham came from two goals down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-cant-deal-crosses-west-10997391 | title='Everton can't deal with crosses'&amp;nbsp;– West Ham scorer Antonio admits targeting Blues after watching videos of their defensive weakness |newspaper=Liverpool Echo | date=6 March 2016 | accessdate=8 March 2016 | author=O'Keefe, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Antonio signed a new, four-year contract with West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36709044|title=Michail Antonio: West Ham winger signs new four-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio started West Ham's first match of the [[2016–17 West Ham United F.C. season|2016–17 season]] in the [[right-back]] position, subsequently giving away a penalty in the early stages of the second half, which was converted by [[Eden Hazard]], to give [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] a 1–0 lead. He was substituted not long after for [[Sam Byram]]. Chelsea went on to win 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/west-ham-united/371/blog/post/2930767/michail-antonio-and-enner-valencia-flop-as-west-ham-lose-opener-to-chelsea | title=Michail Antonio and Enner Valencia flop as West Ham lose to Chelsea | publisher=ESPN FC | date=15 August 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match of the season, on 21 August 2016, Antonio returned to his favourite position of [[Midfielder#Winger|Winger]].

In March 2016, Antonio revealed that he had rejected the opportunity to play for [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica internationally]] and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham's Michail Antonio turned down Jamaica for England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35835036|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2016|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2016, in new [[England national football team|England]] manager [[Sam Allardyce]]'s first squad, Antonio was called up for the first time, for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|2018 World Cup qualification]] match against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 where he was an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England squad named for opening 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovakia as Michail Antonio wins first call-up|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2016/aug/england-squad-slovakia-2018-fifa-world-cup-qualifier|publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2017, Antonio was called up by new England manager [[Gareth Southgate]]'s squad for the friendly match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 22 March and the 2018 World Cup qualifier against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] on 26 March, however, on 20 March, Antonio withdrew from the squad after picking up a hamstring injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michail Antonio out of England games with Germany and Lithuania|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/10808380/michail-antonio-out-of-england-games-with-germany-and-lithuania|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He primarily plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], but can also play as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right midfielder or right winger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luke showed what we've been miss-ing!|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/luke-showed-what-we-ve-been-miss-ing-1-5082500|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byram was called up to the [[England national under-20 football team|England Under 20 team]] for the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] but withdrew from the squad through injury and remains uncapped at international level.

==Club career==
Byram was born in [[Thurrock]], [[Essex]],&lt;ref name="Hugman"/&gt; before moving north, where he attended Ralph Butterfield Primary School, [[Haxby]], and then [[Joseph Rowntree School]] in [[York]]. He played for the City Schools team as a boy before joining [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/archive/2003/10/15/York+Archive/7898168.print/ | title = Five-star York are in fine Nick | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = York Press. | date = 15 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his secondary education at school, he signed scholar forms with the West Yorkshire club in 2010. During his first year as scholar, he played 'down' a year in the under-16 team to help his development as a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120820/sam-signs-up-for-the-future_2247585_2895119 | title = SAM SIGNS UP FOR THE FUTURE | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later progressed to his age group in the under-18s where he would become a regular in the team during his second year in 2011–12. As an integral part of the team, he scored several goals over the course of the season as the under-18s finished as runners-up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in their divisional academy league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120425/united-pride-in-runners-up-spot_2247585_2748334 | title = UNITED PRIDE IN RUNNERS-UP SPOT | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 25 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120531132718/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120425/united-pride-in-runners-up-spot_2247585_2748334# | archive-date = 31 May 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the season in May 2012, he was one of five young players rewarded with their first professional contracts for their performances in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120502/the-magnificent-seven_2247585_2757299 | title = THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
[[File:Sam Byram.jpg|thumb|175px|Byram playing for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2012]]

In the first friendly match of Leeds United's 2012–13 pre-season against [[Farsley Celtic F.C.|Farsley Celtic]], Byram was one of a number of youngsters given an opportunity to impress manager [[Neil Warnock]] when he lined up for the second half at [[Throstle Nest]].&lt;ref name="Vital Football"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leeds.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=287701 | title = LUFC Five star Leeds see off Farsley Celtic | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Vital Football | date = 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; United recorded a convincing 5–2 victory over their city rivals.&lt;ref name="Vital Football"/&gt; Nevertheless, he would travel with the first-team on their summer tour of the South West of England the following week, featuring in the games against [[Tavistock A.F.C.|Tavistock]], [[Bodmin Town F.C.|Bodmin Town]] and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120723/united-hit-tavistock-for-six_2247585_2857883 | title = UNITED HIT TAVISTOCK FOR SIX | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120725/four-star-united-win-at-bodmin_2247585_2860492 | title = FOUR-STAR UNITED WIN AT BODMIN | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120727/south-west-tour-ends-on-a-high_2247585_2863115 | title = SOUTH WEST TOUR ENDS ON A HIGH | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram remained as part of the first-team in pre-season after returning to the North; playing for an hour and scoring in the game away to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120804/three-of-the-best-see-off-preston_2247585_2870743 | title = THREE OF THE BEST SEE OFF PRESTON | accessdate = 4 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After impressing in pre-season, Byram was handed the number 25 shirt for the season ahead and he made his first team debut at [[Elland Road]] in a 4–0 victory over [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] on 11 August in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120811/shrewsbury-live_2247585_2878205 | title = SHREWSBURY LIVE | accessdate = 11 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram retained his place in the first-team the following week in United's first league game of the campaign against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He was part of a defence that kept a clean-sheet in a 1–0 victory over one of the early favourites for promotion and his performance out-wide against the [[England national football team|England]] international [[Matt Jarvis]] won praise from several observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120818/united-open-up-with-a-winner_2247585_2889721 | title = Becchio goal secures win against Wolves... | accessdate = 18 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new three-year contract with the West Yorkshire club two days after his league debut and only three months after signing his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120820/sam-signs-up-for-the-future_2247585_2895119 | title = Sam Signs Up for the Future | accessdate = 20 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byram scored his first professional goal on 28 August in the 3–0 League Cup second-round victory over [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]. Picking up the ball just outside the penalty area, he beat two Oxford defenders with his first and second touches before chipping the goalkeeper from inside the box in the 34th minute to give his team a 2–0 lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120828/oxford-live_2247585_2902951 | title = OXFORD LIVE | accessdate = 28 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C.| date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An impressed Neil Warnock told reporters after the game that "Sam will probably never score another goal like that in his career".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/football/live/match-reaction/273452/warnock-pleased-with-cup-win | title = Warnock Pleased with Cup Win | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | work = Sporting Life| date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram remained a permanent feature in the first-team squad during the early months of the season with United legend [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] tipping him to win a call-up to [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] squad in the near future if he maintained his form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.lufcchat.com/legends-on-leeds/gray-on-leeds | title = Gray on Leeds – Byram's got the goods to follow Lees' international call | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = LUFC Chat| date = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former manager in the under-18s, [[Neil Redfearn]], stated that Byram's rise through the ranks at the club served as a good example for other promising youngsters including his former teammates in the academy side, Ross Killock, [[Dominic Poleon]] and Simon Lenighan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120905/sams-a-shining-light-for-youngsters_2247585_2909567 | title = SAM'S A SHINING LIGHT FOR YOUNGSTERS | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | work = Sporting Life| date = 5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October, he scored his first league goal for Leeds in a 2–2 draw away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], heading in a cross from [[El Hadji Diouf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19709796 "Bolton 2–2 Leeds"] BBC Sport. 2 October 2012.

====2013–14 season====
The hip injury sustained at the end of the 2012–13 season ruled Byram out of the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20]]'s World Cup.

=== Moving up the ranks ===

==== Browne vs. Kalajdzic ====
It was announced that Browne would challenge for his first title, the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC USNBC]] light heavyweight title on April 16, 2016 against fellow undefeated 25 year old [[Radivoje Kalajdzic]] (25-0, 14 KOs) at the Barclays Center in an 8-round bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/spence-algieri-formally-announced-april-16-barclays--101635|title=Spence-Algieri Formally Announced, April 16 at Barclays|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=January 2, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was originally scheduled for 10 rounds, but was cut to 8, minutes before the fight started, due the main event following on. At the time of the fight, Browne was ranked number 7 by the WBA and number 13 by the WBC. Browne won the via a controversial split decision at the end of 8 rounds. Two judges scored the fight 76-74 and 76-75 in favour of Browne, whilst the third judge scored it 76-74 for Kalajdzic. There was controversy from the first round when Kalajdzic fell to the canvas. Browne was credited with the knockdown, although he never threw a punch. Referee Tony Chiarantano was stood behind Browne, most likely misjudged the decision to count the knockdown. In the replay, it shows that Browne landed a punch whilst Kalajdzic slipped. Browne was also dropped in the sixth round. Both fighters claimed they had won in the post fight press conference. A rematch, according to promoter [[Lou DiBella]], was discussed. With the win, Browne won the vacant title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2016/4/16/11445704/pbc-on-nbc-results-marcus-browne-gets-controversial-decision-over|title=Browne gets controversial decision over Kalajdzic|date=April 16, 2016|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Premier Boxing Champions|title=Browne vs Kalajdzic FULL FIGHT: April 16, 2016 - PBC on NBC|date=May 3, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Mzqt7Yp6s|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/marcus-browne-edges-radivoje-kalajdzic-disputed-points-win--103553|title=Marcus Browne Edges Radivoje Kalajdzic In Disputed Points Win|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=January 2, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Kalajdzic hit out at Browne, calling for a rematch, "I don't see how I lost. I was the aggressor. I showed my heart.

'''Julian Andrew Dicks''' (born 8 August 1968) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]], manager and former professional golfer. He is currently the manager of [[Isthmian League]] North Division club [[Heybridge Swifts F.C.|Heybridge Swifts]].

Playing from 1985 until 2002, he was a [[defender (association football)|defender]], notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was voted West Ham's player of the year four times between 1990 and 1997. He also played in the [[Football League]] for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] where he started his footballing career, ending it in 2002 in [[Non-League football|non-league football]] with [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]]. He became manager of [[Wivenhoe Town F.C.|Wivenhoe Town]] in 2009, before moving to [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] later that year. He was capped by both the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] and [[England B national football team|England B]] sides. He was known as a "hard man" adopting the nickname of [[The Terminator]]. He was a tough tackler with a strong shot in regular demand as a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] and free-kick taker. Dicks had a reputation for poor on-field discipline which brought him to the attention of referees, the press and footballing authorities.

==Early life==
Dicks was born in Keynsham Hospital, [[Bristol]] to mother, Carol and father Ron who worked as a fork-lift truck driver for [[Courage Brewery]]. Ron played non-league football with [[Keynsham Town F.C.|Keynsham Town]], [[Welton Rovers F.C.|Welton Rovers]], [[Frome Town F.C.|Frome Town]] and [[Shepton Mallet F.C.|Shepton Mallet]] whom he would also go on to manage. Dicks attended Novers Lane Primary School, in [[Knowle, Bristol|Knowle]], Bristol and Merrywood Boys Secondary School also in Knowle. At age 11 he was watched by former [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager, [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] who was [[Scout (sports)|scouting]] for West Ham United, but was turned down as he "was not quick enough". At age 13 he was spotted playing by Ron Veal who was scouting for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Veal recommended him to Villa manager, [[Ron Saunders]], however Saunders lost his job at Villa on 9 February 1982. When he was appointed as manager of Birmingham City nine days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=1090 | title=Ron Saunders&amp;nbsp;— Managerial statistics | publisher=www.soccerbase.com | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veal also changed his employer. Saunders was impressed when he watched Dicks play and he was offered a footballing apprenticeship with Birmingham City in 1982 when Dicks turned 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | pages=19–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Birmingham City===
He started his footballing career at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], aged 14, having moved from his home in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=brum&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham Legend For Europro Tour|url=http://www.theleader.info/article/6866/west-ham-legend-for-europro-tour/|publisher=www.theleader.info|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022085036/http://www.theleader.info/article/6866/west-ham-legend-for-europro-tour/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing as an apprentice he worked his way through the youth and reserve set-ups before making his debut in 1985 in a 2–0 away defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=brum/&gt; In 1988, he was signed by manager [[John Lyall]] for West Ham United, for £300,000, giving him the chance of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] football that Birmingham's relegation in 1986 had denied him.&lt;ref name=brum/&gt; Although Dicks had been [[Yellow card (sport)|booked]] 33 times and [[Red card (sports)|sent-off]] once in all competitions, in his four seasons with Birmingham City, Lyall identified potential in the player enthusing "There was a great touch there. I wouldn't have signed just a physical player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
Dicks made his debut for West Ham on 2 April 1988 in a [[Football League Division One|Division One]] game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. West Ham lost the game 2-1.&lt;ref name="whustats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=192&amp;united=Julian_Dicks | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Julian Dicks | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to make eight appearances in the [[1987-88 West Ham United F.C. season|1987-88 season]], his first season with West Ham. The following season, he became a regular player and first choice [[left back]] for The Hammers, starting the first game of the season, a 4-0 away defeat to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and playing 34 of a possible 38 games that season.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; The season also saw his first goal for the club in a 2-1 defeat at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3626&amp;united=04_Feb_1989 | title=Game played 4 February 1989 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a poor season for West Ham who were relegated to [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] having finished one place off the bottom of the league in 19th place with 38 points.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; Relegation had seen the sacking of manager [[John Lyall]] and the appointment of Scot, [[Lou Macari]]. The new manager and Dicks exhibited a poor working relationship from the outset.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ex-hammers.com/page.php?21 | title=Julian Dicks exclusively told; | publisher=www.ex-hammers.com | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, and with West Ham now playing second tier football, Dicks retained his left back position and became their regular [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taker following the exit of former first choice taker, [[Ray Stewart (Scottish footballer)|Ray Stewart]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; Dicks became well known for his penalties. During his West Ham career he scored 35, missing four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/game-over-for-super-mario-balotelli-misses-a-penalty-for-the-first-time-in-his-career-so-where-does-the-italian-stand-among-the-other-spot-kick-greats-such-as-eric-cantona-and-matt-le-tissier-8835149.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=7 | title=Game over for Super Mario!

His first red-card was in a match versus [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the [[Football League Cup]] in the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3669&amp;united=22_Nov_1989 | title=Game played 22 November 1989 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an infamous encounter which included an on-pitch brawl between the opposing players. The fighting was sparked by a two-footed tackle by Wimbledon player, [[Dennis Wise]] on Dicks. Six players were booked with the game being described as "a disgrace to football" by journalist, [[Brian Woolnough]].&lt;ref name="Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham finished 7th in a season which saw the departure of Lou Macari and the appointment of former player, [[Billy Bonds]] as manager. Dicks and Bonds both had reputations as "hard men" and quarrelled frequently.&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

====Injury====
The [[1990-91 West Ham United F.C. season|1990-91]] season saw the start of Dicks' injury problems. On 13 October 1990, playing in a game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]], Dicks hit a dip on the edge of the pitch, his foot going over the edge resulting in a loss of feeling in his left leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to play but after the game he could barely walk. Against the medical assessment of John Green, who was soon to take over as club physiotherapist, he was told to "crash-on" and in the words of manager Bonds "if the knee goes, it goes". Green believe Dicks was in need of an operation on his knee [[cartilage]]. He was picked to play in the next game, against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] but lasted only 38 minutes. He played again in the next game on 24 October 1990, against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] but again had to be substituted. A knee operation followed and he would not play again until 21 December 1991 by which time West Ham had been promoted back to the First Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another relegation and promotion====
He played in the second half of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]]. Despite his presence, the team finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and missed out on the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|first season]] of the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1992&amp;united=1st_Division_1991-92 | title=1st Division 1991-92 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]] was an eventful one for Dicks, mainly for the wrong reasons. He was sent off three times and picked up a string of bookings which saw him miss significant periods of the season and he was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Bonds. His first dismissal came after he threw his elbow into the face of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] player [[Franz Carr]].&lt;ref name=term154&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been no friction between the two players with Dicks saying of the incident "Not to this day do I know why I did it. I had it in my mind that I was going to elbow him, and that was it&amp;nbsp;— bang!".&lt;ref name=term154/&gt; Only four games passed before he was dismissed again. In a game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Dicks clashed with [[Paul Birch (footballer, born 1962)|Paul Birch]] and [[Steve Bull]] before being sent-off, with Billy Bonds having to stop him attacking Birch who was still on the ground.&lt;ref name=term156&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three months passed before his third dismissal of the season. In January 1993 after two bad fouls on [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] midfielder [[Ted McMinn]] he was sent-off, having to be escorted from the pitch by teammate [[Clive Allen]].&lt;ref name=term160&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his disciplinary problems he earned a Division One runners-up medal as West Ham reached the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--ups-and-downs-west-hams-joy-pitches-portsmouth-into-the-minefield-2322074.html | title=Football / Ups and Downs: West Ham's joy pitches Portsmouth into the minefield | work=The Independent | date=10 May 1993 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Haylet, Trevor | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his dismissals he played 34 league games of a possible 46 in the promotion season, scoring eleven goals, placing third in the list of highest goal scorers for that season behind only Clive Allen and [[Trevor Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1993&amp;united=1st_Division_1992-93 | title=1st Division 1992-93 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premier League and Liverpool transfer===
Now playing in the Premier League for the first time, West Ham struggled in their first seven games. New signing [[Simon Webster (footballer)|Simon Webster]] had a long term injury having had his leg broken by Dicks in a training session accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-reid-keen-to-capture-stewart-1486920.html |title=Reid keen to capture Stewart |first=Clive |last=White |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 July 1993 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow new signee [[Dale Gordon]] had failed to make the impression on the side his transfer had intended. In a move engineered by West Ham's then-Assistant Manager [[Harry Redknapp]], Dicks was transferred in order to bring in new players. Liverpool manager [[Graeme Souness]], on the recommendation of Redknapp, watched Dicks play in a West Ham match against Swindon Town on 11 September 1993. Souness thought Dicks to be "my kind of player" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed him for Liverpool that week in a swap deal which involved [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]] and [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] moving to West Ham. Extra money received by West Ham from the transfer was used by Redknapp to buy veteran [[Forward (association football)|striker]], [[Lee Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eofQ_6gjZK0C&amp;pg=PT109&amp;lpg=PT109&amp;dq=west+ham+dicks+marsh+burrows+chapman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0hohV66mYL&amp;sig=7NYlf-X8ihXtADyk7XVF0eAfJvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LbZVUsDiFuHsiAfJg4HYAg&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20ham%20dicks%20marsh%20burrows%20chapman&amp;f=false | title=Hammers in the Heart | author=May, Pete | isbn=978-1-78057-450-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks' signing had been part of an effort by Souness to "toughen up" the Liverpool team as he had planned to pair him with fellow hard man, [[Neil Ruddock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/souness-adds-new-hard-man-1.741508 | title=Souness adds new hard man | work=Herald Scotsman | date=18 September 1993 | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dicks debut on 18 September came in a high-profile game against local rivals, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]]. In an eventful game, Liverpool lost 2-0. Former West Ham players, [[Mark Ward (footballer born 1962)|Mark Ward]] and [[Tony Cottee]] scored with Dicks' mistake on the ball allowing Cottee to control it and score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1917 | title=Everton 2-0 Liverpool | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also memorable for the on-pitch fighting of Liverpool teammates [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Bruce Grobelaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1330070.stm | title=Football in-fighting | publisher=BBC Sport | date=14 May 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Austin, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now a regular in the Liverpool side Dicks scored his opening goal, a shot from 25 yards, in a 3-0 away win against [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in January 1994. His discipline had also improved and he had yet to be booked whilst in Liverpool colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/945 | title=Dicks repays an act of faith | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Dicks, Souness was proving to be an unpopular manager. He had dropped fan's favourites [[Ian Rush]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] to the reserve team due to perceived under performance and he had tried to integrate too many young and inexperienced players. In February 1994 after a shock [[FA Cup]] loss to Bristol City, a game in which Dicks did not play, the fans were calling for him to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1958 | title=Liverpool 0-1 Bristol City | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Souness left Liverpool after three years in charge, in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/articles/article/455 | title=Souness' Anfield agony | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Roy Evans]] who had always disliked Dicks and his style of play. Working under Souness he had kept his opinions to himself. Now with Evans as Liverpool manager Dicks' found himself out of favour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated197"&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks and Evans and his assistants [[Ronnie Moran]] and [[Steve Heighway]], disagreed over training methods, Dicks' fitness (they considered him to be overweight) and diet. Evans banished him to play with the reserve and to train with 15- and 16-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played for Liverpool on 7 May 1994 in a 2-1 away defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. It proved to be his last first-team game for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1958 | title=Aston Villa 2-1 Liverpool 1 | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-season of the [[1994-95 Liverpool F.C. season|1994-95 season]] started badly for Liverpool and for Dicks. Picked to play in a [[friendly match|friendly game]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at [[Burnden Park]] on 26 July 1994, Liverpool lost 4-1. Evans was again critical of Dicks' performance in the defeat; tired of such criticism he asked for a move from the club.&lt;ref name="autogenerated197"/&gt; He had played 28 games for Liverpool in all competitions, scoring three goals, although Dicks has the honour of being the last Liverpool player to score in front of the standing [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]] at [[Anfield]] in a 1–0 win against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] near the end of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/dicks/| title=PAST PLAYER PROFILE Julian Dicks| dead-url=yes| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525112209/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/dicks/ |archive-date=25 May 2007| website=www.liverpoolfc.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/289 | title=Player profile&amp;nbsp;— Julian Dicks | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Liverpool career lasted only 13 months, a short time considering his former manager Souness had said of Dicks, "if I was to pick the best 11 players I've ever worked with, he'd be one of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to West Ham===
On re-signing Dicks, manager [[Harry Redknapp]] commented that he believed that his chairman thought he "was off his rocker" because Dicks was considerably heavier than when he had departed for Liverpool a year earlier.

Another knee injury resulted in him missing the entire [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]]. He did return to action in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]] and West Ham finished fifth to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]], but his injury problems failed to go away and he was restricted to just nine Premier League games. West Ham then terminated his contract and he retired from professional football after a 14-year career, 11 years of which had been spent at West Ham. In two spells at West Ham, he had played 315 competitive games and scored 64 goals, many of them penalties. His final appearance for the club came against Arsenal on 6 February 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2000 Dicks was granted a [[testimonial match]] by West Ham. On 13 August 2000 a West Ham eleven took on Spanish side [[Athletic Bilbao]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]]. The game was marred by a 17 player brawl in which West Ham player [[Igor Stimac]] was booked for a bad tackle and the West Ham captain for the day, [[Paolo Di Canio]], slapped several Spanish players in the face. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp was ordered to remove Di Canio for the pitch to defuse the tension. Bilbao coach, [[Txetxu Rojo]], was ordered to remove player [[Joseba Etxeberria]] for a similar reason. Bilbao won the game 2-1&lt;ref name="testimonial1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/879091.stm | title=Brawl mars Dicks' benefit match | publisher=BBC Sport | date=13 August 2000 | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testimonial2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jun/29/theknowledge.sport | title=When testimonials go bad | work=The Guardian | date=29 June 2005 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Dart, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks received £200,000 from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34647441|title=Testimonials: 1D, injuries, fights... what's ahead for Wayne Rooney?|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canvey Island===
In 2001, he made a brief return to football after signing for non-League [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3018043/FA-Cup-Dicks-dreaming-of-return-to-the-big-time.html | title=FA Cup: Dicks dreaming of return to the big time | work=Daily Telegraph | date=3 December 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Luscombe, Richard | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only ten days after signing for Canvey Island, he was involved in an FA Cup [[Upset (competition)|shock]]. Playing against [[Football League]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the first round of the competition, Canvey turned-out 1-0 winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1658794.stm | title=Wigan 0-1 Canvey Island | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=10 October 2013 | date=17 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-36777,00.html | title=Canvey's 'monster' win | work=The Guardian | date=18 November 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success continued in the next round.

==International career==

Dicks made his debut for the [[England under-21 national football team|England under-21]] team in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland in a friendly game against the [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland under-21]] team on 28 May 1988. The game finished 1-1 with the England goal being scored by [[Paul Gascoigne]]. Dicks' performance convinced manager [[Dave Sexton]] to call him into the squad for the 1988 [[Toulon Tournament]]. He played in England's first game of the competition against the [[Mexico national under-20 football team|Mexico under-21]] team in the [[Stade Mayol]] in [[Toulon]] on 5 June 1988. He was sent-off for a foul on a Mexican player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/09/newsstory.sport7 | title=Hammer hardman with another set of irons in his soul | work=The Guardian | date=9 January 1999 | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undeterred by his sending-off, after missing one game through suspension, Sexton picked Dicks to play in the semi-final against the [[Morocco national under-20 football team|Morocco under-21]] team and for the final against the [[France national under-21 football team|France under-21]] team which England lost 4-2.
Four years later, in 1992, Dicks was called in to the [[England B national football team|England B team]]. He played only two games for the side; a 1-0 win in the [[Stadion Střelecký ostrov]] stadium, [[České Budějovice|Budweis]], Czechoslovakia against the [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] team and a 1-1 draw in the [[Luzhniki Stadium]], [[Moscow]] against the [[CIS national football team|CIS]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u21-intres86.html |title=England&amp;nbsp;— U-21 International Results 1986-1995 - Details |publisher=www.rsssf.com |accessdate=11 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125164210/http://rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u21-intres86.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/09/newsstory.sport7 | title=Hammer hardman with another set of irons in his soul | work=The Guardian | date=9 January 1999 | accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/MatchRslTmB.html | title=The B Team | publisher=www.englandfootballonline.com | accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 [[England national football team|England]] first team manager, [[Terry Venables]], was putting together a squad to compete in [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro96]] in England. Dicks' performances had earlier given rise to journalists to call for his inclusion in the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-le-saux-is-so-forward-thinking-1427295.html | title=Football: Le Saux Is So Forward Thinking | publisher=The Independent | date=6 March 1994 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Winter, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further disciplinary events ended such calls. On 11 September 1995 he was booked for stamping on the head of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[John Spencer (Scottish footballer)|John Spencer]] in a 3-1 home defeat for West Ham. Spencer required eight stitches in his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-year-of-men-behaving-badly-1527142.html | title=The year of men behaving badly | work=The Independent | date=23 December 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Moore, Glenn | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dicks-to-face-fa-disrepute-charge-1602074.html | title=Football: Dicks to face FA disrepute charge | work=The Independent | date=20 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Shaw, John | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16 September 1995 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] he was dismissed for the eighth time in his career for a foul on [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-rely-on-wright-1601553.html | title=Arsenal rely on Wright | work=The Independent | date=17 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Fox, Norman | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two incidents coming so close together caused the media to focus on the incident involving John Spencer. TV pundit [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]] and politician, radio journalist and Chelsea supporter, [[David Mellor]] called for [[The Football Association|FA]] to get involved. The game had been televised live on [[BSkyB|Sky TV]] and a recording of it was provided to the match referee, [[Robbie Hart]] who had booked Dicks during the game. [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] newspaper ran a full back-page on the incident with several pictures of the challenge and of blood on Spencer's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellor's radio program, [[606 (radio show)|606]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eofQ_6gjZK0C&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=julian+dicks+john+spencer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I7tZUq2HG6S3igLDg4GAAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=julian%20dicks%20john%20spencer&amp;f=false | title=Hammers in the Heart | publisher=Mainstream Publishing | author=Pete May | isbn=978-1-78057-450-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; had focused so intently on the clash that combined with The Sun's coverage, public focus was sufficient for Dicks' daughters to be attacked at their school in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/match-bitterness-1601761.html | title=Match bitterness | publisher=The Independent | date=19 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FA considered the video evidence provided and a report from referee Hart and Dicks was given a three-match ban.&lt;ref name=keane&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MAD+KEANE+HAMMERED+ME+BECAUSE+I+REFUSED+TO+SAVE+HIS+BUTT%3B+JULIAN...-a061153336 | title=Mad Keane Hammered Me Because I Refused To Save His Butt; Julian Dicks | publisher=www.thefreelibrary.com | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban put in doubt any future involvement in England squads due to concerns over his indiscipline and although Venables watched him play in April 1996 he was not called into the Euro 96 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-110832327 | title=Stage Set for Dicks to Impress Venables | newspaper=Daily Mail | date=13 April 1996 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Shepherd, Rob| url-access=subscription| via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 with [[Glenn Hoddle]] now manager of England, Dicks met, by chance, his assistant, [[John Gorman (footballer)|John Gorman]] whilst on holiday. Dicks claims Gorman had told him he would stand a better chance of being picked if he had grown his hair. Dicks frequently shaved his head sporting a [[skinhead]] hairstyle.&lt;ref name=keane/&gt; Gorman also said that Dicks had been a candidate for selection for a game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in 1997. By this time Dicks had said he no longer wished to be considered for international selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DICKS+CAN+BE+HODD'S+JULE!%3B+SAYS+HARRY+REDKNAPP.-a061102981 | title=Dicks Can Bb Hodd's Jule!; Says Harry Redknapp | publisher=www.thefreelibrary.com | year=1997 | accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Arthur Bonds''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 17 September 1946) is a former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[coach (sport)|manager]], who is most often associated with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] with whom he spent 27 years as player and manager. He played 799 first-team games for West Ham in a career spanning 21 seasons.

==Background==
Born in [[Woolwich]], south-east [[London]], Bonds grew up in nearby [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], where he played for a Sunday boys' team, Moatbridge, and Kent Schoolboys and joined the groundstaff at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] after leaving school at 15.&lt;ref name=Bonzo&gt;{{cite book| last =Bonds| first =Billy| authorlink =| title =Bonzo| publisher =Barker| year =1988| location =London| pages =4–14| url =| doi =| id = | isbn =978-0-213-16960-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the youth and A team and occasionally in the reserves before joining the playing staff shortly before his 18th birthday in September 1964.&lt;ref name=Bonzo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Northcutt1993&gt;{{cite book | last =Northcutt | first =J. |author2=R.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Bonds made his League debut for Charlton against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in February 1965 and became a regular in the first team, going on to make 95 League appearances, scoring one goal, before being signed by [[Ron Greenwood]] for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a fee of £50,000 in May 1967.&lt;ref name=Northcutt1993 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Cameron| first =C.| title =Home and Away with Charlton Athletic 1920–2004| publisher =Voice of the Valley| year= 2003 | location =London| pages =211–225 | id =  | isbn =0-9518125-2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for West Ham in a testimonial match for [[Kenneth Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]] in the same month and made his League debut against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the opening game of the 1967–68 season.&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite book | last =Hogg| first =T.| title =Who's Who of West Ham United | publisher =Profile Sports Media | year= 2005 | location =London| pages =30–31 | id =| isbn =1-903135-50-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ever-present in the 1968–69 and 1969–70 seasons and played 124 consecutive league games until injury ended his run of appearances in October 1970.&lt;ref name=Northcutt1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TonyM&gt;{{cite book | last =McDonald| first =T.| title =West Ham In My Day | publisher =Football World | year= 2007 | location =Essex| pages =103–113  | isbn =0-9551176-8-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds played his first three seasons as a right-back before Greenwood switched him to midfield in the 1970–71 season where he counterbalanced the skills of [[Trevor Brooking]].&lt;ref name=TonyM /&gt; Bonds was at his peak in the early 1970s, helping West Ham to the semi-final of the [[Football League Cup]] in the 1971–72 season, where they lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] after a second replay, and topping the scorers list at West Ham in the 1973–74 season with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=TonyM /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite book | last =Hayes| first =D.| title =The Upton Park Encyclopedia: an a-z of West Ham United| publisher =Mainstream | year= 1998 | location =Edinburgh| pages =24–25  | id = OCLC: 60220812 | isbn =1-84018-043-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the departure of [[Bobby Moore]] in March 1974, Bonds was appointed to the captaincy and led the club to an [[FA Cup]] final victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1975 and to the final of the [[1976 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1976 European Cup Winners' Cup]] despite a groin injury that interrupted the latter half of the 1974–75 season and part of the 1975–76 season. Greenwood moved Bonds from midfield to the back four as centre-half alongside [[Tommy Taylor (footballer b. 1951)|Tommy Taylor]] shortly before the end of the 1976–77 season, where he was able to come out from defence with the ball.

He experienced relegation with West Ham at the end of the 1977–78 season but led West Ham to a second FA Cup victory over [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1980, becoming the only West Ham captain to lift the FA Cup on two occasions. In 1980–81, he led West Ham to the final of the League Cup, which was lost to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a replay, and to promotion back to the First Division.

Bonds passed Bobby Moore's club record of appearances in 1982–83 and 'officially' retired in May 1984, relinquishing the captaincy to [[Alvin Martin]]. A spate of injuries to first-team players saw him return to the squad and make 26 league and cup appearances in 1984–85. He missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a toe injury but, having passed his 40th birthday, he was able to re-establish himself in the first-team during the 1986–87 season. A knee injury that forced him out of the last two games of the 1987–88 season led to a decision to finally retire in the summer of 1988, having played his last game at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in April 1988 at the age of 41 years and 226 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/archive/Billy-Bonds-previously-unseen-pictures-of-the-West-Ham-legend-plus-original-Daily-Mirror-features-and-stories-from-our-archive-article361.html |title=Billy Bonds 6'2", eyes of blue...

Bonds had remained at the club as a player for over 20 years, scoring 48 goals in a club record 663 [[the Football League|League]] appearances. He established himself as a local hero and was the supporters' choice for [[West Ham United#Hammer of the Year|'Hammer of the Year']] in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1987. He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in January 1988 and was presented with the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]] Merit Award in April 1988 by his fellow professional players. In May 2013 Bonds was awarded West Ham United's first ever lifetime achievement award.&lt;ref name=Lawhufc&gt;{{cite web |title=Bonzo honoured at Awards Night |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/bonzo-honoured-at-awards-night_2236884_3171503 |publisher=Www.whufc.com |accessdate=9 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193859/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/bonzo-honoured-at-awards-night_2236884_3171503 |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2019 it was announced that the East Stand at The [[London Stadium]] will be renamed the Billy Bonds Stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47141319|title=West Ham: Billy Bonds gets London Stadium stand named after him|date=6 February 2019|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unveiling took place ahead of West Ham's home fixture against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 2 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47340494|title=West Ham 2-0 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International career===
Bonds was capped twice at England Under-23 international level and was on the bench as a non-playing substitute for the senior international team for a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in November 1977. A collision with goalkeeper [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1950)|Phil Parkes]] in the last game of the [[1980–81 in English football|1980-1981 season]] broke two of Bonds' ribs, and ruled him out of selection for England against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in May 1981. Bonds and [[Alvin Martin]] were in line to make their England debuts in that game.

==Managerial career==
After Bonds retired as a player in 1988, West Ham manager [[John Lyall]] appointed him as youth coach. He unsuccessfully applied for the manager's post when Lyall left the club in July 1989 after West Ham had been relegated. However, when new manager [[Lou Macari]] resigned seven months later, Bonds was appointed manager in February 1990. In his first full season in charge, he took the club to promotion, when they finished as runner-up to [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in [[1990–91 West Ham United F.C. season|1990-91 season]], also reaching the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] where they lost to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He was awarded a second testimonial in the same season.

West Ham were relegated in the [[1991-92 West Ham United F.C. season|1991–92 season]] in bottom place, but the board kept faith in Bonds and he led them to promotion the [[1992-93 West Ham United F.C. season|following season]], when they finished as runner-up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Bonds guided West Ham to a 13th-place finish in the [[1993–94 Premier League]]. He resigned in August 1994, just before the new season began, when he was replaced by [[Harry Redknapp]]. He had spells in coaching at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] before making a return to management with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in May 1997. He managed 53 games before being sacked by the club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2014/06/20/the-ten-most-bizarre-uses-for-a-retired-west-ham-united-footballer-4769428/|title=The ten most bizarre uses for a retired West Ham footballer|date=20 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following year as they finished in the bottom half of Division Two.

With the club for 21 years, and winning the [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980 FA Cup]] Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] before moving into football management with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. This lasted  two seasons before he started a career in the media on radio station [[talksport|talkSPORT]] and also as a [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] on [[Sky Sports]] TV football talk shows.
Playing 17 times for [[England national football team|England]] during the 1980s, Martin represented them at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Walton, Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], Martin played schools football for Bootle and Lancashire and was attached to [[Merseyside]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a schoolboy, but left in 1974 after the [[Goodison Park]] club only offered him an apprenticeship on a part-time basis. An unsuccessful trial later that summer with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] was followed the very next day by one for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], where he was awarded a contract as an apprentice 19 August 1974.&lt;ref&gt;West Ham handbooks 1986-87 and 1988/90&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in the FA Youth cup final of 1975 and signed as a professional on 29 July 1976. He did not make his first team debut until 18 March 1978 as a substitute against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. His final appearance was as an 88th-minute substitute on 5 May 1996 against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

Martin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], in which he became one of only two players, along with [[Billy Bonds]], to be awarded two [[Testimonial match|testimonials]].&lt;ref name="SCOUSER"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/scouser-martins-heart-with-the-hammers--at-a-stretch-477140.html|title=Scouser Martin's heart with the Hammers – at a stretch|first=Ronald|last=Atkin|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=7 May 2006|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] on 21 August 1988 and the second against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 11 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Handbooks 1988/89 and 1996/97&lt;/ref&gt; It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Martin — nicknamed 'Stretch'&lt;ref name="SCOUSER"/&gt; — enjoyed his most rewarding years, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] winners medals in successive seasons, [[1979–80 FA Cup|1980]] and 1981.

Martin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a [[hat-trick]] against three different [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]s — [[Martin Thomas (footballer born 1959)|Martin Thomas]], who was then injured, and outfield players [[Chris Hedworth]] and [[Peter Beardsley]] — in a [[Football League First Division]] match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8–1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as it [[1985–86 Football League|finished third in the top level]], just four points behind champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3485602.stm|title=The hat-trick Hall of Fame|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=25 February 2004|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals.

Martin remained loyal to West Ham despite their [[1988–89 Football League|relegation from the top flight in 1989]], and helped them gain promotion two years later. The club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the [[Premier League]] before finally departing at the end of the [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96 season]] after 21 years service, aged 37.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=434&amp;united=Alvin_Martin Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Alvin Martin]&lt;/ref&gt;
After leaving West Ham, Martin had a brief spell with [[East End of London|East London]] neighbours [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], before managing [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] for two years, during which the club was relegated to the [[Football League One|League One]].

==International career==
Martin was given his first [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|cap]] by [[Ron Greenwood]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in May 1981. Injury ruled him out of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] finals in Spain, but he was playing some of the finest football of his career when the next manager, [[Bobby Robson]], included him in his squad for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 edition in Mexico]]: he played in the victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/r2_eng_v_par.html|title=England - Paraguay 3-0 (1-0)|publisher=Planet World Cup|date=18 June 1986|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, replacing the suspended [[Terry Fenwick]], but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s infamous [[Hand of God goal|'Hand of God']]; in total, he made 17 international appearances.

==Career after football==
After retiring from management, he joined national radio station [[talksport|talkSPORT]], while also being a regular pundit on [[Sky Sports]] TV football talk shows.

==Personal life==
Martin's sons, [[David Martin (footballer, born 1986)|David]] and [[Joe Martin (footballer)|Joe]], are also footballers. The former is a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], whilst the latter is a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].

'''Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (12 April 1941&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1993) was an English professional [[Association football|footballer]]. He most notably played for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] the club for more than ten years, and was the captain of the [[England national football team|England national team]] that won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] of all time, and was cited by [[Pelé]] as the greatest defender that he had ever played against.&lt;ref name="bobbymoore19412"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbymoore.co.uk/Quotes.html|title=Bobby Moore 1941–1993|date=|publisher=Bobbymoore.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely regarded as West Ham's greatest ever player, Moore played over 600 games for the club during a 16 year tenure, winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1963–64]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1964–65]]. During his time at the club he won the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year|FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1964 and the [[West Ham United|West Ham Player Of The Year]] in 1961, 1963, 1968 and 1970. In August 2008, West Ham United officially retired his number 6 shirt, 15 years after his death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7541638.stm Hammers make Moore shirt gesture]&amp;nbsp;– BBC News, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was made captain of England in 1964, at age 23, going on to lift the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] in 1966. He won a total of 108 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for his country, which at the time of his international retirement in 1973 was a national [[Progression of England association football caps record|record]]. This record was later broken by [[Peter Shilton]]. Moore's total of 108 caps continued as a record for an outfield player until 28 March 2009, when [[David Beckham]] gained his 109th cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1042546.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=|title=Beckham dedicates record to family|date=28 March 2009|publisher=Fifa.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306031021/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid%3D1042546.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=|archivedate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=31 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore is a member of the [[World Team of the 20th Century]]. A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore is positioned at the entrance to [[Wembley Stadium]].

A composed [[central defender]], Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]]. He was made an inaugural inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].

==Football career==

===Early days===

[[File:BOBBY MOORE - 43 Waverley Gardens Barking London IG11 0BH.jpg|thumb|upright|Moore's childhood home, 43 Waverley Gardens, Barking, London]]
Moore was born in [[Municipal Borough of Barking|Barking]], [[Essex]]. He attended Westbury Primary School Barking,  and [[Tom Hood School]], [[Leytonstone]], playing football for both schools.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Bobby (1966)'' My Soccer Story'' Stanley Paul &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Moore joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, he played his first game on 8 September 1958 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=477&amp;united=Bobby_Moore|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Bobby Moore|date= |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In putting on the number six shirt, he replaced his mentor [[Malcolm Allison]], who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]].

Allison never played another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Moore became a regular. A composed [[central defender]], Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.

Moore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on [[Dave Wagstaffe]] in the final moment of a match against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full time. As [[Penalty card|red cards]] were not issued at that time, the dismissal didn't become apparent until after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seeing Red for the Claret and Blue |first=John |last=Powles |publisher=SoccerData |location=Nottingham |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-905891-54-2 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore also played [[cricket]] for the [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] youth team alongside fellow West Ham player [[Geoff Hurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/208547.html |title=Test centuries against all nations, and plain sailing |publisher=www.cricinfo.com |date=2 May 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An England star, a European winner===
In 1960, Moore earned a call up to the [[England national under-23 football team|England Under-23]] squad. His form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned him a late call-up to the [[England national football team|full England squad]] by [[Walter Winterbottom]] and [[The Football Association]] selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's [[FIFA World Cup 1962|World Cup]] finals in [[Chile]]. Moore was uncapped as he flew to [[South America]] with the rest of the squad, but made his début on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly&amp;nbsp;– a 4–0 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in [[Lima]]. Also débuting that day was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] defender [[Maurice Norman]]. Both proved so impressive that they stayed in the team for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter finals at [[Viña del Mar]].

[[File:Bobby Moore vs Josef Masopust 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Moore (left) vs. [[Josef Masopust]] at the [[1963 England v Rest of the World football match]].]]
On 29 May 1963, 22-year-old Moore captained his country for the first time in just his 12th appearance after the retirement of [[Johnny Haynes]] and an injury to his successor, [[Jimmy Armfield]]. He was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 4–2 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach [[Alf Ramsey]] gave Moore the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]].

1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Moore. As well as gaining the England captaincy, he lifted the [[FA Cup]] as West Ham defeated [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3–2 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], courtesy of a last-minute goal from [[Ronnie Boyce]]. On a personal level, Moore also was successfully treated for [[testicular cancer]] and was named the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]].

The FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] after West Ham defeated [[1860 Munich]] 2–0 in the final with both goals coming from [[Alan Sealey]]. By now he was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the [[FIFA World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]].

1966 had a mixed start for Moore. In January, he scored his first England goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at [[Goodison Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hankin|first=Alex|title=Send in the clown: England's colourful history of matches against Poland|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-v-poland-down-the-years-1379070|accessdate=24 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Mirror|location=London|date=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]&amp;nbsp;– in its last season before its transfer to Wembley as a one-off final&amp;nbsp;– which they lost 5–3 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and his West Ham teammates [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]], considerable consolation lay ahead. Moore scored his second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], two weeks before the World Cup would begin.

===World Cup===
{{Main|1966 FIFA World Cup}}

[[File:Champions statue.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[World Cup Sculpture]]'' featuring Moore with the World Cup trophy, on the shoulders of [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], together with [[Martin Peters]]]]
On the verge of his greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore had let his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of [[Alf Ramsey|Sir Alf Ramsey]] and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham to allow him to captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up.

Moore was the leader of the [[History of the England national football team#1966 World Cup champions|World Cup winning side]] and established himself as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, they then beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in their quarter final and a [[Eusébio]]-led [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] team in the semi-finals. [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] awaited in the final.

According to Geoff Hurst's [[autobiography]], England full back [[George Cohen]] overheard Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter&amp;nbsp;– who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps&amp;nbsp;– was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, [[Jack Charlton]].

[[File:The Queen presents the 1966 World Cup to England Captain, Bobby Moore. (7936243534).jpg|thumb|left|The Queen presents the 1966 [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] to England captain Moore]]

In the final, England went 1–0 down through [[Helmut Haller]], but Moore's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. He was fouled by [[Wolfgang Overath]] midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, he picked himself up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Hurst scored.

The West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2–1 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through [[Wolfgang Weber]]&amp;nbsp;– as Moore appealed unsuccessfully for a [[Handball (soccer)|handball]] decision&amp;nbsp;– to take the match into extra time.

Ramsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final#Controversial third England goal in extra time|scored a controversial and heavily debated goal]], the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore on the edge of his own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;40&amp;nbsp;yards&amp;nbsp;(40&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/span&gt; upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.

Of many memorable images from that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as she presented him with the [[Jules Rimet trophy]] (World Cup).  ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote "Moore is the calmest person in the stadium as he leads the England players up to the Royal Box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/feb/22/vault-remembering-life-football-bobby-moore |title=From the Vault: Remembering the life and football of Bobby Moore |first=Hugh |last=McIlvanney |author-link=Hugh McIlvanney |first2=Frank |last2=Keating |author2-link=Frank Keating (journalist) |first3=David |last3=Lacey |date=22 February 2013 |access-date=4 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an icon==

[[File:BobbyMooreBust.JPG|thumb|left|200|Bust of Bobby Moore in the entrance foyer of the stand bearing his name at West Ham's [[Boleyn Ground]].]]
Moore became a national icon as a consequence of England's success, with him and the other two West Ham players taking the World Cup around the grounds which West Ham visited during the following domestic season. He was awarded the coveted [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years. He was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.

Moore's image and popularity allowed him to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], and he also appeared with his wife Tina, along with Peters and his wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to ''"Look in at the local"''.

He continued to play for West Ham and England, earning his 50th cap in a 5–1 win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the [[1968 European Football Championship|1968 European Championships]]. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where they played [[Yugoslavian national football team|Yugoslavia]] in [[Florence]] and lost 1–0. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and Moore remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning his 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to [[South America]] for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in [[Mexico]].

===1970===
{{further|Bogotá Bracelet}}
The year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Moore. Retained as captain for the [[FIFA World Cup 1970|1970 World Cup]], there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the [[theft]] of a [[bracelet]] from a [[jeweller]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for it. While Moore had been in the shop (having entered with [[Bobby Charlton]] to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in [[Quito]]. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2–0 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of [[house arrest]]. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Moore received a guard of honour from his squad when he arrived at the team hotel.

Moore went on to play a leading role in England's progress through their group. On 2 June he captained England to a 1–0 victory against Romania. In the second game against favourites [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], there was a defining moment for Moore when he tackled [[Jairzinho]] with such precision and cleanness that it has been described as the perfect tackle.&lt;ref name=Tackle&gt;{{cite web|title=Bobby MOORE|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174780/index.html|publisher=www.fifa.cm|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be shown on television around the world.&lt;ref name=Tackle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bobby Moore's tackle on Jairzinho in 1970 World Cup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21317369|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil still won the game 1–0, but England progressed through the group. Moore swapped shirts with [[Pelé]] after the game.&lt;ref name=Tackle/&gt; The shirt was displayed at the [[National Football Museum]] in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/collections/about-our-collections/current/the-priory-collection/ |title=The Priory Collection |publisher=www.nationalfootballmuseum.com |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016064344/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/collections/about-our-collections/current/the-priory-collection/ |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in the group and advance to the knockout stage.

At the Quarter Final stage, a rematch of the 1966 World Cup against West Germany, England took a 2–0 lead but lost 3–2 in extra time. At the end of the year, Moore was voted runner-up (behind [[Gerd Müller]] of West Germany) for the 1970 [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/a/Ballon-D-Wouldor-Winners.htm | title=Ballon d'or winners | publisher=World od soccer | accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years at the top===
On 10 August 1970, Moore received an anonymous threat to kidnap his wife and hold her to a £10,000 ransom. This caused him to pull out of pre-season friendlies against [[Bristol City]] and [[Bournemouth]]. However, his services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against [[Glasgow Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at the end of 1970.

Although Moore was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, he was not without his faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, [[Jimmy Greaves]], [[Brian Dear]] and [[Clyde Best]], were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The [[nightclub]] in [[Blackpool]] was owned by Moore's friend, [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Brian London]]. West Ham lost the tie 4–0. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of [[Division One|Division one]] at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' the night before. [[Brian Glanville]] stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the [[alcohol]] he had consumed the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glanville|first=Brian|title=The real Bobby Moore|url=http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2839/stories/20050924000907700.htm|publisher=www.sportsstronthenet.com|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore surpassed West Ham's appearances record in 1973 when he played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on [[Valentine's Day]] 1973, he won his 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5–0 win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]]. By this stage, only Peters and [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the England team. Later the same year, Moore was exposed defensively by [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in a qualifier for the [[FIFA World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]] in [[Chorzów]], deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to [[Wlodzimierz Lubanski]], who scored the second.

Moore's form had dipped enough for Ramsey to choose not to select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: "Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year." It never happened, as England could only draw 1–1. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorzów, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper [[Jan Tomaszewski]] blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When [[Kevin Hector]] finally did come on for [[Martin Chivers]] after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to [[David Miller (editor)|David Miller]] "you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch." Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken.  England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.

Moore won his 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1–0 friendly defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 14 November 1973. He became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton's record by two appearances, and equalled [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]]'s record of 90 appearances as captain. [[Peter Shilton]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.

===After West Ham and England===
Moore played his last game for West Ham in an FA Cup tie against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in January 1974. He was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, he was allowed to leave West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with him the club record for appearances (since overtaken by [[Billy Bonds]]) and the most international caps for an outfield player.

He joined London rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], who were in the [[Football League Championship|Second Division]], for £25,000. During Moore's first season there they defeated West Ham in a League Cup tie and then reached the [[FA Cup Final 1975|FA Cup Final]] where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2–0, and Moore had made his final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.

Moore played his final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He played for two teams in the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|North American Soccer League]]&amp;nbsp;– [[San Antonio Thunder]] in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by [[Gerry Francis]]. This was the [[1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament|U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament]], which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the [[1976 European Football Championship|European Championships that year]]. In April 1978 he signed his very last contract as a professional player, when he joined [[Denmark|Danish]] side [[Herning Fremad]] to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&amp;h=37 |title=Historie |publisher=Herningfremad.dk |date= |accessdate=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124512/http://www.herningfremad.dk/default.asp?id=38&amp;h=37 |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Moore appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct [[Carolina Lightnin']], after injuries left the club without cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East End to NC end: The final playing days of West Ham legend Bobby Moore|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/east-end-to-nc-end-the-final-playing-days-of-west-ham-legend-bobby-moore/15843646/|publisher=WRALSportsFan.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-football career==
Moore retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at [[Eastern AA]] in [[Hong Kong]], [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. Moore publicly supported [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mercury |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2010/01/31/the-celebrity-friends-of-margaret-thatcher-66331-25740208/ |title=The celebrity friends of Margaret Thatcher |work=Birmingham Mail |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became manager of Southend United in 1984. In his first full season, 1984–85, Southend narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election to the Football League amid severe financial difficulties. However, the side was gradually rebuilt and in the 1985–86 season Southend started well and were in the promotion race until the new year before eventually finishing 9th. His successor, [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]] built upon those foundations to win promotion the following year. Moore agreed to serve on the board of the club and held this role until his death.&lt;ref name=PeterMason&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Peter|title=Southend United: the official history of 'The Blues'|year=1994|isbn=1-874427-20-8|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore joined London radio station [[Gold (radio)|Capital Gold]] as a football analyst and commentator in 1990.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web|last=Jonathan|first=Pearce|title=Bobby Moore: Modest, generous, meticulous and very, very funny|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21554794|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His life after football was eventful and difficult, with poor business dealings and his marriage ending. Moore's supporters said that the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] could have given a role to Moore, as the only [[England|Englishman]] to captain a [[FIFA World Cup]] winning team or given him an ambassadorial role.&lt;ref name=gu2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Paul|title=From the Vault: Remembering the life and football of Bobby Moore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/feb/22/vault-remembering-life-football-bobby-moore|accessdate=25 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
[[File:BMTRIBS.JPG|thumb|right|200|Tributes to Bobby Moore outside the Boleyn Ground on 6 March 1993]]
Moore's first brush with cancer was in 1964, two years before the historic World Cup win. He was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], which he survived by having one testicle surgically removed; the cancer had not spread.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Luke (23 November 2012) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2237346/Bobby-Moore-beat-testicular-cancer-1966-World-Cup-win.html Revealed: Legend Moore beat cancer before leading England to 1966 World Cup victory]. ''Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1991, Moore underwent an emergency operation for suspected [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], though at the time it was just reported that he had undergone an "emergency stomach operation".

On 14 February 1993, he publicly announced he was suffering from [[Colorectal cancer|bowel]] and [[Liver cancer|liver]] cancer; by this stage the cancer had spread. Three days later, he commentated on an England match against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] at Wembley, alongside his friend [[Jonathan Pearce]]. That was to be his final public appearance; seven days later on 24 February, at 6.36 am, he died at the age of 51.

[[File:City of London Cemetery - Bobby Moore grave plaque in the Memorial Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|Moore's grave in the Memorial Gardens, City of London Cemetery]]
He was the first member of the England World Cup winning side to die, the second being [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] 14 years later. Moore was also outlived by the trainer of the side, [[Harold Shepherdson]], who died in September 1995, and the manager of the side, [[Alf Ramsey]], who died in April 1999. [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]] died in May 2018, as did Gordon Banks in February 2019. Bobby Moore's funeral was held on 2 March 1993 at [[Putney Vale Cemetery|Putney Vale crematorium]] and his ashes were buried in a plot at [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium]] with his father, Robert Edward Moore (who died in 1978) and his mother, Doris Joyce Moore, who had died only the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=7348504&amp;PIpi=21561444 |title=Bobby Moore (1941–1993) – Find A Grave Photos |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first West Ham home game after his death was on 6 March 1993, against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. The Boleyn Ground was awash with floral tributes, scarves and other football memorabilia from both West Ham fans and those of other clubs. Fellow [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] winners [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]] placed a floral replica of a West Ham shirt, showing Moore's number, 6, on the back, on the centre spot before the game. West Ham rested the No. 6 for the game, with the regular No. 6, [[Ian Bishop (footballer)|Ian Bishop]], wearing No. 12. The game was won by West Ham 3–1 with goals by [[Trevor Morley]], [[Julian Dicks]] and [[Matty Holmes]] for West Ham and [[Steve Bull]] for Wolves.&lt;ref name="Leatherdale"&gt;Leatherdale, Clive (1998).

[[File:BMWHUWW.JPG|thumb|West Ham and Wolves players line-up for a minute's silence for Bobby Moore before their game at the Boleyn Ground on 6 March 1993]]

His former England teammate, [[Jack Charlton]], on a [[BBC]] documentary of Moore's life in and outside of football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074r86 |title=Four Programmes&amp;nbsp;— Hero: The Bobby Moore Story |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; said of Moore's death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I only ever cried over two people, [[Billy Bremner]] and Bob... [long pause] He was a lovely man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 28 June 1993, his memorial service was held in [[Westminster Abbey]], attended by all the other members of the 1966 World Cup team. He was only the second sportsman to be so honoured, the first being the West Indian cricketer Sir [[Frank Worrell]].

{{quote|For many years he delighted supporters of West Ham and was a formidable opponent in the eyes of those against whom he played.

In 1996, [[comedian]]s [[Frank Skinner]] and [[David Baddiel]] used the line "But I still see that tackle by Moore" in the [[lyrics]] to their song "[[Three Lions]]", which was the England team's official song at the [[1996 European Football Championship|1996 European Championships]], which was adopted by fans rather than the tournament's official song ''We're In This Together'' by Simply Red. It referred to the famous incident with [[Jairzinho]] in 1970, and was re-created by Baddiel, Skinner and England [[Fullback (association football)|left back]] [[Stuart Pearce]] for the video. It was written in the context of a list of great England moments of the past as proof that England could win a tournament again.

Moore was made an inaugural inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player. The same year he was named in the BBC's list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2208671.stm "100 great British heroes"]. BBC News.

On 28 April 2003, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] as president of [[The Football Association]] unveiled the ''[[World Cup Sculpture]]'' (also called ''The Champions'') in a prominent place near the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. It depicts Moore holding the [[Jules Rimet Trophy]] aloft, on the shoulders of [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], together with [[Martin Peters]]. The one and a half-size bronze was sculpted by [[Philip Jackson (sculptor)|Philip Jackson]] after a famous photograph taken just after the 1966 final at the old Wembley. The south bank at West Ham's ground up until 2016, the [[Boleyn Ground]] in [[Upton Park, London|Upton Park]], was named the Bobby Moore Stand shortly after Moore's death.

On 26 July 2016, Moore became the first footballer to be honoured with an [[English Heritage]] [[Blue Plaque]] outside his home. The plaque was unveiled on a brick wall at Moore's childhood home in Waverley Gardens, Barking in a ceremony attended by his daughter, Roberta.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/26/childhood-home-of-bobby-moore-receives-english-heritage-plaque | title=Childhood home of Bobby Moore receives English Heritage plaque | work=The Guardian | date=26 July 2016 | accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moore met his first wife, Tina, in 1957 and they married on 30 June 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com Ancestry® | Genealogy, Family Trees &amp; Family History Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a house in Chigwell, Essex, called Morlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearlman |first=Natasha |title=Footballers' wives of 1966 relive the memories |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-389630/Footballers-wives-1966-relive-memories.html |accessdate=5 August 2014 |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a daughter, Roberta, and a son, Dean.

'''Martin Stanford Peters''' {{Post-nominals|country=UK|MBE}} (born 8 November 1943) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] and manager and a member of the [[England national football team|England]] team which won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] as well as playing in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|174852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], [[Essex]], he played club football for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. He briefly managed Sheffield United before retiring from professional football in 1981.

Known as "the complete midfielder" as he could pass the ball well with either foot, was good in the air and difficult to mark because of his movement.&lt;ref name=pamp&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.performingartistes.co.uk/artistes/769/martin-peters.htm|publisher=www.performingartistes.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free kick specialist, Peters was described by England manager [[Sir Alf Ramsey]], after a game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1968, as being "ten years ahead of his time".&lt;ref name=10years&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin Peters: I can't see us ending 44 years of hurt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/martin-peters-i-cant-see-us-ending-44-years-of-hurt-1924707.html|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=www.independent.co.uk|date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His versatility was such that while he was at West Ham he played in every position in the team, including goalkeeper in his third game, replacing an injured [[Brian Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=pamp/&gt; With his transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, he became Britain's first £200,000 footballer.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt;

He made his debut on [[Good Friday]] 1962 in a 4–1 home win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6–1 away win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 8 September 1962.&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Martin Peter|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=524&amp;united=Martin_Peters|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters played only five games in his first season with West Ham and although he played 32 league games in season 1963–4 he played no part in their FA Cup run and was not selected for the [[FA Cup]] final of 1964 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], in which West Ham beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3–2.&lt;ref name=1964facup&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup Final 1964 - Preston 2 West Ham 3 |url=http://www.football-england.com/fa_cup_final_1964_preston_west_ham.html |publisher=www.football-england.com |accessdate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020012103/http://www.football-england.com/fa_cup_final_1964_preston_west_ham.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, however, he established himself as a first team regular and was victorious at Wembley when West Ham won the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] with victory over [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]].&lt;ref name=FA&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/P/Martin-Peters|publisher=www.thefa.com|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was usually partnered in midfield by [[Eddie Bovington]] and [[Ronnie Boyce]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

Peters began to impose himself on West Ham's game, and another chance for silverware came in 1966 when West Ham reached the [[1966 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] final. The occasion was still a two-legged affair with each of the finalists hosting a leg (though this changed to a one-off final at Wembley a year later), and Peters played in both matches. He scored in the second game but opponents [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] emerged as 5–3 winners on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On this day - 2 February|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120202/on-this-day-2-february_2236884_2597541|publisher=www.whufc.com|accessdate=19 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209125803/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120202/on-this-day-2-february_2236884_2597541|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played on 09 Mar 1966|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2479&amp;united=09_Mar_1966|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played on 23 Mar 1966|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2483&amp;united=23_Mar_1966|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968–69 season saw Peters's only [[hat-trick]] for West Ham in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref name=whu3&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played 31 Aug 1968|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2599&amp;united=31_Aug_1968|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also his most prolific season, 24 goals coming from 48 games.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Feeling he was in the shadows of [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Geoff Hurst]], Peters sought out a new challenge. In March 1970, West Ham received a record-breaking £200,000 (£150,000 cash) for Peters from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and Peters moved to White Hart Lane, with Spurs and England striker [[Jimmy Greaves]] (valued at £50,000) going the other way.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|last=Smith| first=Tony| url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/tottenham-hotspur-fc/martin-peters-8744/biography-of-his-football-career-at-spurs_a12073/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1970 Peters scored on his Spurs debut against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; He won his first domestic winners' medal in 1971 when Spurs beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 2–0 in the [[1971 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]].&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; Spurs beat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 3–2 on aggregate to win the 1972 [[UEFA Cup]] in what remained the only all-English European final until Manchester United beat Chelsea in the UEFA Champion's League Final, 2008.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; In 1973, Peters won the League Cup again with Spurs. He completed one more season with Spurs – losing the 1974 UEFA Cup final to [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Cup 1973-74 |first=James M. |last=Ross |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2018 |url= http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec197374.html#uefa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – before moving to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] – managed by his former West Ham teammate [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] – in March 1975 for £50,000.&lt;ref name=thfc2ncfc/&gt;

===Norwich City===
Peters, now aged 31, made his debut appearance for Norwich on 15 March 1975 in a 1–1 away draw to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref name=thfc2ncfc&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/norwich-city-fc/martin-peters-8744/1974-75-1979-80_a17360/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He helped newly promoted Norwich establish themselves in the First Division, making more than 200 appearances, and earning a testimonial against an all-star team which included most of the 1966 World Cup winning England XI. He was voted [[Norwich City F.C. Player of the Season]] two years running, in 1976 and 1977, and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=NCFC-fftn&gt;{{cite web|title=Flown from the nest - Martin Peters|url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/peters-martin.htm|publisher=www.ex-canaries.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, whilst still a Norwich City player, Peters was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to [[association football]].&lt;ref name=mbe&gt;{{cite web|title=Hammers Awarded and Managers|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=3|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheffield United===
He joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 31 July 1980 as player-coach with the intention of replacing [[Harry Haslam (footballer)|Harry Haslam]] as manager. His first appearance came in a 2–1 victory against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 2 August 1980 in the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] and his League debut came in the opening match of the season in a Division Three fixture against [[Carlisle United]]. He scored once in a 3–0 victory.

==International career==
[[File:Champions statue.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Peters (left) as part of [[World Cup Sculpture|The Champions statue]], [[Newham]], London]]
[[Alf Ramsey]] had seen Peters' potential quickly, and in May 1966 he gave the young midfielder his debut for England against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] at Wembley.&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/P/Martin-Peters|publisher=The FA.com|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won 2–0 and Peters had an outstanding debut. Nearly scoring twice he set up chances for Jimmy Greaves and for others.&lt;ref name=englanddebut&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup hero Martin Peters made his England debut on this day.|url=https://www.thefa.com/England/News/2010/OTD_040510|publisher=www.thefa.com|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final preparation period for Ramsey prior to naming his squad for the World Cup, Peters played in two more of the scheduled warm-up games. Against [[Finland national football team|Finland]], he scored his first international goal in what was only his second appearance,&lt;ref name=finland&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.englandcaps.co.uk/martinpeters.html|publisher=www.englandcaps.co.uk|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently he made Ramsey's squad for the competition, as did his West Ham teammates [[Bobby Moore]] (the England captain) and [[Geoff Hurst]].&lt;ref name=1966squad&gt;{{cite news|last=Norrish|first=Mike|title=England v Germany all-time greats: where are they now?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/3472121/England-v-Germany-all-time-greats-where-are-they-now-Football.html|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Peters did not play in the opening group game against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], the drab 0–0 draw prompted Ramsey into changes.&lt;ref name=fa/&gt; The England coach had been toying with using a system which allowed narrow play through the centre, not operating with conventional wingers but instead with fitter, centralised players who could show willing in defence as well as spread the ball and their runs in attack. Peters therefore had become an ideal player for this 4–1-3-2 system, elegant in his distribution and strong in his forward running, yet showing the stamina, discipline and pace to get back and help the defence when required. This system was dubbed "the wingless wonders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/heritage/hampshire100/100sport/1484615.Sir_Alf_Ramsey/ | title=Sir Alf Ramsey | publisher=www.dailyecho.co.uk | date=20 June 2007 | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=44549/index.html | title=Ramsey. Alf | publisher=FIFA.com | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey put Peters in the team for his fourth cap, for the second group game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], which England won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 16.07.1966 England vs Mexico|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13755|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept his place as England got through their group, scraped past a violent [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] side in the quarter finals (Peters' late cross set up Hurst's header for the only goal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 23.07.1966 England vs Argentina|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13767|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the last four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 26.07.1966 England vs Portugal|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13769|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[West Germany national football team|Germans]] awaited in the final.

A tense but open game at Wembley saw the score at 1–1 in the final quarter of an hour when England won a corner. [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] delivered it to the edge of the area to Hurst, who tried a shot on the turn. The ball deflected high into the air and bounced down into the penalty area where Peters rifled home a half-volley. The Germans equalised in the final seconds, though glory would still come the team's way with the 4–2 win in extra time, and Hurst – like Peters, winning only his eighth cap – completing a historic hat-trick.&lt;ref name=1966video&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 1966 - England beat Germany in Wembley final|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8388240.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico Peters played in England's three group games from which they qualified again with West Germany waiting in the last eight. Peters scored against the Germans again early in the second half – a run and finish from behind a defender which no West German player had spotted – to establish a 2–0 lead, but later Ramsey committed a tactical error by [[substitute (soccer)|substituting]] Peters and [[Bobby Charlton]] with [[Colin Bell]] and [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]], and West Germany won 3–2 in extra-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 14.06.1970 England vs West Germany|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=11591|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mpengland&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/martin-peters-8744/english-caps-1966-74_a12075/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Peters won his 50th England cap in a qualifier for the [[1972 European Football Championship|1972 European Championships]], beating [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 3–2.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; England failed to progress due to another defeat against West Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 29.04.1972 England vs West Germany|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=11821|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who went on to win the tournament. International disappointment for Peters was tempered mildly by more club success, and he scored the only goal as England beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at Wembley on 19 May 1973.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; It was his 20th goal for his country and would prove to be his last. England had been stuttering in their qualifying campaign for the [[Football World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]], dropping points in a drawn game against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and then a 2–0 defeat against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in [[Chorzów]] on 6 June 1973.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; England needed to defeat Poland at Wembley on 17 October 1973 to qualify for the finals in Germany and, with an out-of-form Moore dropped from the side (he'd only play once more subsequently for his country) Peters captained the side for the crucial game. A defensive error allowed Poland to score and only a penalty allowed England to level up quickly. [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] scored from it, but England could not get the crucial winning goal. Poland went through after the match finished 1–1 meaning Peters would not play in a third successive World Cup competition.
At the age of 30, Peters' career at the highest level began to slip away. He played three more games for England,&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; reaching a total of 67 caps, though his career with his country ended, on 18 May 1974, as England lost 2–0 against Scotland at [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref name=fa/&gt;

==Management career==
His wait to become manager was not long, his final game coming against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 17 January 1981 which Haslam was too ill to attend, and at which there were demonstrations from the Sheffield United fans. Peters retired to take up the manager's job the following day with United 12th in the table with 16 games to play, but was unable to halt the decline already in place, winning just three of the remaining games. For the first and only time in their history Sheffield United were relegated to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], and Peters resigned.&lt;ref name=Haslem&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Martin|title=Biog of managers from the 1974-75 season|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/sport/the_damned_united/4938702/Biog-of-managers-from-the-1974-75-season.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his retirement from professional football in January 1981, after a distinguished and injury-free career, he had made 882 appearances in total, scoring 220 goals. After he quit Sheffield United Peters spent the 1982–83 season playing in defence for [[Gorleston F.C.|Gorleston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://members.multimania.co.uk/gorlestonfc/history.HTM | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718033312/http://members.multimania.co.uk/gorlestonfc/history.HTM | dead-url=yes | archive-date=18 July 2012 | work=Gorleston FC History | location=Norfolk | title=Gorleston FC History | first=, | last=Gorleston FC | date=8 April 2006 | accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Eastern Counties League]].

In 1984, he moved into the insurance business where he stayed until he was made redundant in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/08/newsstory.sport | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The best of times | first=Simon | last=Hattenstone | date=8 April 2006 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Peters joined the board of directors at Spurs, and, although he since stepped down, he remains one of the match-day welcomers in the hospitality suites at the club's [[White Hart Lane]] ground. He has also worked in the hospitality suites at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] for West Ham home matches, often attending with his children and grandchildren, all West Ham supporters.

In 2006, Peters published his [[autobiography]], ''The Ghost of 66'', to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=g66&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ghost of 66|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7671357-the-ghost-of-66|publisher=www.goodreads.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters was inducted, with former manager [[Ron Greenwood]], into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2006 in recognition for his achievements as a player.&lt;ref name=HofF&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame for Greenwood and Peters|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20061018/hall-of-fame-honour-for-greenwood-and-peters_2236884_1141902|publisher=www.whufc.com|accessdate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114648/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20061018/hall-of-fame-honour-for-greenwood-and-peters_2236884_1141902|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2016, it was announced that Peters had [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36005864|title=FA wants Fifa to investigate possible dementia link to ex-footballers|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, Peters identifies as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/sport-and-politics-how-twitter-has-changed-the-rules-10187193.html|title=Sport and politics: how Twitter has changed the rules|work=The Independent|first=Ian|last=Herbert|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Trevor David Brooking''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE}} (born 2 October 1948) is a former [[England national football team|England]] international [[Association football|footballer]], manager, [[pundit]] and football administrator; he now works as director of football development in England.

He played most of his career for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] making 647 appearances for the club. He won the [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975 FA Cup]] and the [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980 FA Cup]] in which he scored the only goal. He was also the club's [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|player of the season]] on four occasions and caretaker manager on two occasions in 2003. Brooking played 47 times for [[England national football team|England]], scoring five times. He was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1981, elevated to [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|Commander]] of same order (CBE) in 1999, and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 2004. In 2009 a stand at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] was named after Brooking. Since retiring from playing, he has taken up a number of positions in broadcasting as an on-air analyst and in football and sports administration.

==Club career==

===West Ham United===
Brooking was born in [[Barking, London|Barking]] maternity hospital to mother Margaret and father, Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking attended Ripple Infants School and left [[Ilford County High School]] with 11 [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]]s and 2 [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]].&lt;ref name="brooking"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooking |first=Trevor |title=Trevor Brooking |publisher=Pelham Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-7207-1374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father took him to see his first [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] game at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], a 1–1 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 19 Apr 1958 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2094&amp;united=19_Apr_1958 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged fifteen he trained at both [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name="page 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However West Ham manager, [[Ron Greenwood]] watched him with scout [[Wally St Pier]], and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies.&lt;ref name="page 17"/&gt; Despite his parents being offered £500 and a car by manager [[Tommy Docherty]] to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;

Brooking made his debut in place of wide-right [[Brian Dear]] on 29 August 1967 in a 3–3 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4–2 away win at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=85&amp;united=Trevor_Brooking |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only [[hat-trick]] came on 6 April 1968 in a 5–0 home defeat of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; During his third season, in December 1969 Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref name="page 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club signed [[Peter Eustace]] for £90,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected and he considered giving up the game.&lt;ref name="page 39"/&gt; However he returned to playing and with the departure of [[Martin Peters]] to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971–72 season with the purchase of midfielder [[Tommy Taylor (footballer born 1951)|Tommy Taylor]], and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the failure of the defensive partnership between [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Alan Stephenson]] saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1972–73 season he came to the attention of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] manager [[Brian Clough]], who offered West Ham £400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] offered £425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;

He won the [[FA Cup]] twice, in [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]]&lt;ref name=1975fa&gt;{{cite web |title=1975 West Ham v Fulham |url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120428152821/http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham |dead-url=yes |archivedate=28 April 2012 |publisher=www.thefa.com |accessdate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  with Brooking scoring a vital goal in a 2–1 win in a 4th round replay away at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]&lt;ref name=stfc&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 28 Jan 1975 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2911&amp;united=28_Jan_1975 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]; in the latter, he scored another vital goal in a 2–1 win in a third round replay against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]&lt;ref name=wbfc&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 08 Jan 1980 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3158&amp;united=08_Jan_1980 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup Final hero: Sir Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203349/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking was a member of the West Ham team which won the [[1980–81 West Ham United F.C. season|Second Division in 1981]]. He also appeared in the [[1975 FA Charity Shield]], the [[1976 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]], the [[1980 FA Charity Shield]] and the [[1981 Football League Cup Final]]. His last game for West Ham came on 18 May 1984 in 1–0 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; In total he made 647 appearances and scoring 102 times, wearing the number 10 jersey, his total appearances for West Ham only beaten by [[Billy Bonds]], [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Frank Lampard, Sr.|Frank Lampard]] Sr. He had a [[testimonial match]] against an England XI in October 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Brooking accepted an invitation to play for [[Newcastle Blue Star F.C.|Blue Star]] in a Wearside League game against [[Coundon TT F.C.|Coundon]] on 28 April 1985.  Blue Star had paid for him to fly to Newcastle as their guest and reportedly paid him an appearance fee of £500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://northernleagueday.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-the-northern-league-matters-to-me-1/ |title=Why the Northern League matters to me |publisher=NorthernLeagueToday |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Brooking played briefly for [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] making two appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cork City&amp;nbsp;— History |url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/club-info/history/ |publisher=www.corkcityfc.net |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lyallpavilion&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir Trevor Brooking Opens John Lyall Pavilion |url=http://fcbusiness.co.uk/news/article/newsitem=1481/title=sir+trevor+brooking+opens+john+lyall+pavilion |publisher=www.fcbusiness.co.uk |accessdate=24 September 2012 |date=20 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231051/http://fcbusiness.co.uk/news/article/newsitem=1481/title=sir+trevor+brooking+opens+john+lyall+pavilion |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Brooking made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 3 April 1974 in a 0–0 draw against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref name=England&gt;{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking&amp;nbsp;— England |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222125910/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |dead-url=yes |archivedate=22 February 2013 |publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played 47 times, scoring 5 goals but only appeared twice in major tournaments. At [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] in Italy he played in England's opening game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] which was a 1–1 draw, but was dropped for the second game against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] which England lost 1–0. Re-instated to the starting eleven against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] he scored England's first goal in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England match details 1980-1984 |url=http://www.englandfc.com/nostal/yrbyyr/1980_1984.html |publisher=www.englandfc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927231019/http://www.englandfc.com/nostal/yrbyyr/1980_1984.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to injury [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 1982]] was to see him limited to playing as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] against Spain on 5 July 1982. Playing for only the last half-hour of the game, Brooking forced one excellent save from the Spanish goalkeeper, [[Luis Arconada]], but with England needing to win to qualify for the semi-final a 0-0 draw saw them eliminated. This was to be his final international appearance.&lt;ref name=Lastintgame&gt;{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/B/Trevor-Brooking |publisher=Www.thefa.com |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Brooking was primarily right-footed, but was comfortable on his left foot. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his controlled passing and midfield authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diamonds Aren't Forever |url=http://www.thesportcollective.com/diamonds-arent-forever-joe-cole-england-liverpool-chelsea-west-ham/2011/06/ |publisher=www.thesportcollective.com |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after [[Cyril Lord]] the carpet salesman, as [[Ron Greenwood]] told him "you're always on the floor").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow [[baseball]] player called [[Boog Powell]] the team had witnessed during a tour of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, [[Hadleigh (TV series)|Hadleigh]], after a television [[upper class]] and urbane detective played by [[Gerald Harper]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadleigh&gt;{{cite news |last=Coe |first=Sebastian |title=Government programme for sport delivered by Lottery |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3035967/Government-programme-for-sport-delivered-by-Lottery.html# |accessdate=17 September 2012 |newspaper=www.dailytelegraph.co.uk |date=12 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
In April 2003, after West Ham manager [[Glenn Roeder]] collapsed due to a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], Brooking, having long been on the board at West Ham, briefly took over as caretaker manager. The club were fighting relegation from the [[Premier League]]. Brooking took charge of three games. His first game resulted in a 1–0 away win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] with a goal from [[Frédéric Kanouté]].&lt;ref name=mcfc2003&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Kanoute injects fresh hope into West Ham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/28/match.manchestercity |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=www.guardian.co.uk |date=28 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second saw West Ham beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1–0, thanks to a goal from [[Paolo Di Canio]].&lt;ref name=whufccfc2003&gt;{{cite news |title=Di Canio grabs West Ham lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2968013.stm |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final game of the season saw West Ham draw 2–2 away at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] resulting in relegation,&lt;ref name=bcfcwhu2003&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham relegated |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2978071.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  albeit with 42 points, a record number for a relegated team.&lt;ref name=fortytwo&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title='Survival Sunday' looms in what promises to be one of the tightest Premier League relegation battles ever |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8362912/Survival-Sunday-looms-in-what-promises-to-be-one-of-the-tightest-Premier-League-relegation-battles-ever.html |accessdate=12 August 2011 |newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk |date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first three games of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003/2004 season]] with West Ham now in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], Roeder was sacked after West Ham suffered an away defeat to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]&lt;ref name=Roedersacked&gt;{{cite news |title=Roeder sacking inevitable |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3178205.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brooking was again installed as caretaker manager. He managed for eleven games, losing only once, to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], a 2–0 away defeat in which [[Jermain Defoe]] was sent-off.&lt;ref name=gills&gt;{{cite news |title=Gillingham 2-0 West Ham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3109594.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003 he was replaced by [[Alan Pardew]], who was appointed on his recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media career==
In 1984, Brooking joined the [[BBC]] as a pundit, and has featured on radio and television commentary since, including the BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]'' and coverage of [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]]. He was also the co-commentator in the ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]'' video game series, alongside [[Peter Brackley]] until ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 6]]''.

==Football administration==
Brooking was Chair of the Eastern Region Council for Sport and Recreation from 1987 until 1997, and between 1999 and 2002 he was chairman of [[Sport England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, he joined [[the Football Association]] as Director of Football Development, a role which gave him total of control of coaching and development in English football, as well as a role in appointing future [[England national football team|England]] managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a key part of the selection process for the successor of the [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], revealed in May 2006 to be [[Steve McClaren]]. In 2004, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to sport.&lt;ref name="LG"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=57315 |supp=y|page=1|date=12 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In June 1970, he married Hilkka, a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[au pair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two children: Collette and Warren.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, along with schoolfriend Colin McGowan, Brooking started a [[book binding]] company, Colbrook Plastics Limited (now Colbrook Binding Limited), in [[Basildon]], [[Essex]]. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Essex]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=HonoraryGraduates&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Essex Calendar |url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm |publisher=www.essex.ac.uk |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007233550/http://www.essex.ac.uk/academic/docs/cal/former.shtm |archivedate=7 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, his autobiography, ''Trevor Brooking, My Life in Football'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shales |first1=Mark |title=West Ham legend Trevor Brooking signs autobiographies at Newham Bookshop |url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/west_ham_legend_trevor_brooking_signs_autobiographies_at_newham_bookshop_1_3797728 |accessdate=17 February 2015 |work=Newham Recorder |date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 West Ham United announced that from 8 August, the start of the 2009/10 Premier League Season, 'The Centenary Stand' at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] would be named 'The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand' in his honour.&lt;ref name=stand&gt;{{cite web|title=Srand for Sir Trevor |url=http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724154238/http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stand was used by away supporters and had been the scene for crowd disturbances.

|quote=It is obviously a terrific honour (to have the stand named after me), which I am very grateful for because this is my club. It will be my club forever. The great thing was being able to spend my whole career with West Ham, having a stint as caretaker manager and as a director.
I still try and get to most of the home games. On my travels, if I am in a cab or something then everyone talks to me about West Ham because they know I am associated with the club. It is something I am only too pleased about whenever it happens. We have a very passionate and loyal support

'''Sir Geoffrey Charles Hurst''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 8 December 1941)&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. A [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], he remains the only man to score a [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final, when [[England national football team|England]] recorded a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4–2 victory]] over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]].

Hurst began his career with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], where he scored 242 goals in 500 first team appearances. There he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1964]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1965]]. He was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1972 for £80,000. After three seasons with Stoke he finished his [[The Football League|Football League]] career with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 1976. Hurst went to play football in Ireland ([[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]]) and the USA ([[Seattle Sounders (1974–1983)|Seattle Sounders]]) before returning to England to manage non-league [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]. He also coached in the England set-up before an unsuccessful stint as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager from 1979 to 1981. He later coached [[Kuwait SC]] before leaving the game to concentrate on his business commitments.

In total he scored 24 goals in 49 England appearances, and as well as success in the 1966 World Cup he also appeared at [[UEFA Euro 1968]] and the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. He also had a brief [[cricket]] career, making one [[First-class cricket|First-class]] appearance for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1962, before concentrating on football.

==Early life==
Hurst was born in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Lancashire, on 8 December 1941.&lt;ref name="page 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two younger siblings: Diane and Robert.&lt;ref name="page 24"/&gt; His family moved to [[Chelmsford]], Essex when he was six years old.&lt;ref name="page 24"/&gt; His father, [[Charlie Hurst]], was a professional footballer who played at centre-half for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Evelyn Hopkins, was from a [[Gloucestershire]] family with her mother's side originally from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancestry{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he was obsessed with football, and was once fined £1 for disturbing the peace after consistently kicking a football into his neighbour's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst played one [[first-class cricket]] match for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/14322.html |title=Geoff Hurst player profile |publisher=Cricinfo.com}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Aigburth]] in 1962, although it was not a successful outing: he made 0 [[not out]] in the first [[innings]], and was [[bowled]] by Colin Hilton, again for 0, in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |title=Lancashire v Essex, County Championship 1962 |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210023255/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |archivedate=10 February 2009}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he appeared 23 times in the Essex Second XI between 1962 and 1964, usually as a wicketkeeper, before concentrating entirely on football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |title=Second Eleven Championship Matches played by Geoff Hurst (23) |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155741/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |archivedate=10 February 2009}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst's football career began when he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Ted Fenton]] first selected him for a senior game in a [[Southern Professional Floodlit Cup|Southern Floodlit Cup]] tie with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in December 1958.&lt;ref name="page 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid £7 a week with a £20 signing on fee.&lt;ref name="page 31"/&gt; His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3–1.&lt;ref name="page 31"/&gt; He made only two further appearances in the [[1959–60 Football League|1959–60]] season, and realised that [[Bobby Moore]] was making better progress in the same position than he was.&lt;ref name="page 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played six times in the [[1960–61 Football League|1960–61]] campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket.&lt;ref name="page 32"/&gt; In April 1961 [[Ron Greenwood]] took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst missed the start of [[1961–62 Football League|1961–62]] pre-season training due to his cricketing commitments, but went on to make 24 appearances at left-half, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in December 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that season Greenwood tried playing Hurst as a striker after deciding that the defensive side of his game was a weakness for the young midfielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a successful partnership with [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] and went on to score 13 goals in 27 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] games whilst Byrne scored nine in 30 games in the [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of [[1963 International Soccer League|1963]] he joined the club on their pre-season tour of [[New York (state)|New York]], and greatly benefited from playing against top quality players from clubs across the world in the [[International Soccer League]], a friendly tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst and West Ham had a poor start to the [[1963–64 Football League|1963–64]] season, and went on to finish in 14th place. However it was in the [[FA Cup]] where the team impressed. A comfortable 3–0 home win over [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] was followed by another 3–0 home win over East End rivals [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]&amp;nbsp;– though only following a tough 1–1 draw at [[Brisbane Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood named the same 11 players, including Hurst, in all the club's seven FA Cup fixtures as West Ham progressed to the final. Hurst scored one against Charlton and two against Orient, and claimed another goal in the Fifth Round as West Ham beat Second Division [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] 3–1 at the [[County Ground (Swindon)|County Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] provided a stern test in the quarter-finals, but a 3–2 home win took West Ham into the semi-finals, where they faced [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham won 3–1, with Hurst scoring the final goal of the game after being set up by Bobby Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham faced Second Division [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in the [[1964 FA Cup Final]], and had to come from behind twice to win the match 3–2. Hurst scored his side's second equaliser with a header that bounced under the crossbar and ended up just over the goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's success won them a place in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] for the [[1964–65 European Cup Winners' Cup|1964–65]] season. They defeated Belgian side [[K.A.A. Gent]] in the First Round after an unconvincing 2–1 aggregate victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovakian side [[AC Sparta Prague]] awaited in the second round, and West Ham progressed with a 3–2 aggregate victory despite the absence of Moore.&lt;ref name="page 73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite beating Swiss team [[FC Lausanne-Sport]] 6–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hurst had still not registered a goal in the competition as he was played in a withdrawn role behind [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] so as to strengthen the midfield.&lt;ref name="page 73"/&gt; In the semi-finals, West Ham defended a 2–1 home win over Spanish club [[Real Zaragoza]] with a 1–1 draw at [[La Romareda]] to claim a place in the [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] against [[TSV 1860 München]] at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham won 2–0, [[Alan Sealey]] scoring both goals, to give the club their first European trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having scored 40 goals in 59 competitive games in the [[1965–66 Football League|1965–66]] season and then gone on to make himself a household name by winning the World Cup with England, Hurst was the subject of a £200,000 transfer offer by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]]&amp;nbsp;– the offer was rejected by Greenwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the West Ham side which lost the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final 5–3 on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the [[1966–67 Football League|1966–67]] season, West Ham demonstrated the inconsistency that would deny them a realistic prospect of winning a league championship under Greenwood. Hurst scored a hat-trick as they defeated full-strength title challengers [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 7–0 in the League Cup, but they exited the FA Cup with a 3–1 defeat to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"When you're playing for a team that can score seven one day and four the next it's really quite good fun. When job satisfaction is that high, why would you want to play for anyone else?"|Like his manager, Ron Greenwood, Hurst valued entertaining attacking football played in a fair manner and was not prepared to sacrifice these values for silverware.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hurst scored six goals in a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Upton Park on 19 October 1968, which West Ham won 8–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20091030/sunderland-match-preview_2236884_1842142 |title=Sunderland match preview |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827085449/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20091030/sunderland-match-preview_2236884_1842142 |archivedate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he regretted admitting that he handled the ball in his first goal which led to the back page headlines focusing on the illegitimate goal rather than the rare feat of one player scoring six goals in one game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, West Ham reached the semi-finals of the League Cup when they played [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] over two legs. In the home leg at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], they were awarded a penalty after [[Harry Redknapp]] was fouled in the box.&lt;ref name="page 232"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst took the penalty and struck a powerful shot into the top corner which was saved by [[Gordon Banks]], who succeeded in deflecting the ball over the bar.&lt;ref name="page 232"/&gt; Stoke won the tie in the subsequent replay and denied Hurst one more final appearance at Wembley.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Stoke City===
Hurst was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for a £80,000 fee in August 1972.&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Geoff Hurst |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=345&amp;united=Geoff_Hurst |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Tony |title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City |year=1994 |publisher=Lion Press |isbn=0-9524151-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was struck down with [[pneumonia]] early in 1973 and went to South Africa to recover, playing on loan for [[Roy Bailey (footballer)|Roy Bailey]]'s [[Cape Town City F.C. (NFL)|Cape Town City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed just four games for Stoke and upon his return he helped the side to maintain their [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1974, "Potters" manager [[Tony Waddington]] asked Hurst to take in new signing [[Alan Hudson]] as a lodger so as to provide the talented but troubled midfielder with a stable home during his Stoke career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson adapted well to life in the Hurst household and Stoke recorded a fifth place in the [[1973–74 Stoke City F.C. season|1973–74]] season&amp;nbsp;– a career high for Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored 11 goals in 41 games in the [[1974–75 Stoke City F.C. season|1974–75]] season and helped Stoke to finish in fifth place, just four points behind champions [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===West Bromwich Albion===
Hurst was sold to [[Johnny Giles]]'s [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the summer of 1975 for a fee of £20,000.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; He played 12 times for the Baggies at the start of the [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]] season, scoring twice, before deciding to leave for America.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Hurst later acknowledged that at the age of 34 he was too old to lead the line in the "Baggies" push for promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Hurst signed for [[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]] in January 1976, and remained in Ireland for one month.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

He signed for the [[Seattle Sounders (1974–1983)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]] in 1976. Hurst rapidly proved his worth, and became a valuable member of the Sounders team. He was the team's second-leading scorer, helping the Sounders make it to the play-offs for the first time in their brief history, with eight goals and four assists in 23 regular season games, and one goal in the play-offs.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==International career==
===1966 World Cup===
Hurst made his senior [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] on 23 February 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played well, and further performances against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] secured him a place in the squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he put in mediocre performances in warm-up games against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and so [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Roger Hunt]] were instead picked for the final friendly game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref name="page 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greaves and Hunt were indeed picked for the three group games against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and France, but in the later game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter final against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref name="page 7"/&gt;

Argentina were talented but preferred a tougher approach to the game, which saw them reduced to ten men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was still tightly contested as it entered its final 15 minutes, but then [[Martin Peters]] swung over a curling cross from the left flank and Hurst, anticipating his clubmate's action, got in front of his marker to glance a near post header past the Argentine keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won 1–0 and were in the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=239/match=1577/index.html |title=1996 FIFA World Cup 1966 |publisher=fifa.com}} Retrieved on 24 January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greaves was not fit for the game against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] so Hurst and Hunt continued up front, and England won 2–1 thanks to two goals by [[Bobby Charlton]], the second of which was set up by Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves' return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst's contribution, started to call for the return of England's most prolific [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forward]]. Ramsey, however, would not be swayed and selected Hurst for [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

====World Cup Final====
West Germany took the lead through [[Helmut Haller]] early on, but six minutes later [[Bobby Moore]] was fouled just inside the German half of the field. He quickly picked himself up and delivered the free kick to Hurst, who eluded his marker 
[[Horst-Dieter Höttges]] and headed the ball past goalkeeper [[Hans Tilkowski]] to level the scores at 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 12 minutes left to play of normal time, an [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] corner left Hurst with a shooting opportunity on the edge of the penalty area; his shot deflected off [[Wolfgang Weber]] and fell kindly to [[Martin Peters]], who put the ball into the net to give England the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Germans scored a very late goal through Weber to level the match at 2–2 at full-time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the first period of extra-time, Ball made a cross across the near post to Hurst, who struck a strong shot towards goal with his right foot, falling backwards as he did so.&lt;ref name="page 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner. England's players claimed a goal whilst the Germans were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line.&lt;ref name="page 13"/&gt; Referee [[Gottfried Dienst]] consulted his linesman on the right flank, [[Tofiq Bahramov]], who signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and the goal was given.&lt;ref name="page 13"/&gt;

The Germans pushed forward in search of an equaliser as the full-time whistle approached, and [[Bobby Moore]] exploited their advanced position to send Hurst a long ball in the German half of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst reached the German penalty box and fired a powerful shot in the expectation that it would sail over the crossbar and waste time as the match drew to a close; the ball instead struck a divot as it bounced in front of Hurst and the shot connected well enough to beat the goalkeeper and hit the net to end the game at 4–2 to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Hurst collected the pass, [[BBC]] commentator [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]] immortalised his own contribution to the day with one of the most famous pieces of football commentary:

{{quote|And here comes Hurst, he's got&amp;nbsp;... [notices invaders]&amp;nbsp;... some people are on the pitch, [[they think it's all over]]! [Hurst shoots and scores]&amp;nbsp;... It is now! It's four!}}

===Later international career===
Hurst was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1968]], but did not play as England lost 1–0 to [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in the semi-final. He did play, and score, in the 2–0 third-place play-off victory over the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored his second international hat-trick on 12 March 1969, in a 5–0 victory over [[France national football team|France]], and was named in the Ramsey squad which played in [[Mexico]] to defend the World Cup in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the only goal of England's opening game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] after being sent through by a pass from [[Francis Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; England progressed to the quarter finals, where once again they faced West Germany. Hurst played a part in the [[Martin Peters]] goal that put England 2–0 up. With England up 2–1, Hurst's contested header trickled inches past the post. Later, at 2–2, Hurst had what many thought was a legitimate goal ruled out for offside.&lt;ref&gt;England: The Official F.A History, Niall Edworthy, Virgin Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85227-699-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The West Germans scored in extra time and won 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in qualification for [[UEFA Euro 1972]], but played his last international match on 29 April 1972 as England were beaten 3–1 by West Germany&amp;nbsp;– he was replaced by [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]] with 20 minutes left to play and did not take to the field in an England shirt again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in the squad for the second leg against West Germany after [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] and Francis Lee picked up injuries, but had to pull out of the squad after picking up an injury himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
Upon his retirement from playing, Hurst moved into management and coaching. He spent three years as player-manager of [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] before being recruited by [[Ron Greenwood]] in the [[England national football team|England]] coaching set up in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled with England to help Greenwood at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], where England failed to make it past the group stages on both occasions.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Chelsea===
Hurst joined [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], then in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], before the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season, initially as assistant manager to [[Danny Blanchflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Blanchflower was sacked, Hurst was appointed manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hired [[Bobby Gould]] as his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Things initially went well, and for much of the season Chelsea were on course for promotion, but two wins from their final seven league games ensured the club finished fourth. He raised £250,000 through the sales of [[Eamonn Bannon]], [[David Stride]] and [[Trevor Aylott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent £300,000 on [[Colin Lee]], [[Dennis Rofe]] and [[Colin Viljoen]]; he later acknowledged Viljoen as a mistake whilst bemoaning Lee's bad luck with injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season again began well, with the "Blues" among the early promotion pace-setters before a dismal run set in, with Chelsea scoring in just three of their final 22 league matches, culminating in Hurst being sacked on 30 April 1981 and Chelsea finished 12th in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuwait SC===
After being sacked from Chelsea on 23 April 1981 Hurst worked as an insurance salesman for [[Abbey Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he was tempted back into management after being offered a generous salary by [[Kuwait SC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; He controversially disciplined and dropped club captain [[Saad Al-Houti]], but was unable to challenge [[Dave Mackay]]'s [[Al-Arabi SC (Kuwait)|Al-Arabi]] for dominance of the [[Kuwaiti Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Kuwait in April 1984 he returned to the insurance trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 2003 Hurst was included in ''The Champions'', a statue of 1966 World Cup winning footballers, by sculptor [[Philip Jackson (sculptor)|Philip Jackson]]. It sits at the junctions of [[A124 road|Barking Road]] and Central Park Road, [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], London, near to the site of West Ham United's former home stadium, the [[Boleyn Ground]] and features [[Martin Peters]], Hurst, [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Champions |url=http://www.philipjacksonsculptures.co.uk/Commissions/Champions_i.htm |publisher=phillipjacksonsculptures.co.uk |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst's contribution to the English game was recognised in 2004 when he was inducted in the [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Hurst is also one of the few footballers who have been knighted.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

A statue of Hurst was unveiled outside [[Curzon Ashton F.C.]]'s ground in 2010. He is shown alongside two other World Cup winners born in the area, fellow 1966 squad member [[Jimmy Armfield]], and [[Simone Perrotta]], who won it with Italy in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12383705 |title=World Cup hero's home town statue in Greater Manchester |publisher=BBC News |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Paolo Di Canio''' (born 9 July 1968) is an Italian [[Association football|football]] manager and former professional footballer. During his playing career he made over 500 league appearances and scored over one hundred goals appearing primarily as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but could also play as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], or as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]]. A talented yet controversial player, Di Canio was known for his creativity, technical ability, and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, as well as his temperamental character, tenacity and aggression on the pitch.&lt;ref name="Di Canio, Paolo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/Di_Canio_Paolo|title=Di Canio, Paolo|website=tuttocalciatori.net|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Il Pallone Racconta: Paolo Di Canio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.ca/2007/07/paolo-di-canio.html|title=Paolo Di Canio|publisher=Il Pallone Racconta|language=Italian|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paolo di Canio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Dicanio.html|title=Paolo di Canio|website=magliarossonera.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tuttojuve.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-paolo-di-canio-196426|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Paolo DI CANIO|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author1=Stefano Bedeschi|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Canio began his career in the Italian [[Serie A]], playing for [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[A.C. Milan]], before a brief spell with the Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He subsequently spent seven years in the English [[Premier League]] with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He returned to Italy in 2004, playing for Lazio and [[Atletico Roma F.C.|Cisco Roma]] before retiring in 2008. He played for the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian under-21s]], making 9 appearances and scoring 2 goals, and was notably a member of the squad that finished in third place at the [[1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] under manager [[Cesare Maldini]], but was never capped for the [[Italy national football team|senior team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=401&amp;squadra=1|title=Nazionale in Cifre: Convocazioni e presenze in campo - Di Canio, Paolo|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the individual awards he received as a player, Di Canio was named [[SPFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 1997 and West Ham's [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|player of the season]] in 2000. However, his career was at times characterised by controversy: he received an eleven-match ban in 1998 for pushing a referee and attracted negative publicity over his self allegiance to [[Italian fascism|fascism]].

In 2011, Di Canio entered football management in England with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], guiding them in his first full season as manager to promotion to [[Football League One|League One]]. He was appointed as the [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] manager at the end of March 2013. His controversial appointment lasted 13 games until he was sacked on 22 September after Sunderland had won only three games under his managership.

==Early life==
Di Canio was born in Rome, in the district of Quarticciolo, a working-class area populated mainly by [[A.S. Roma]] fans. However, Di Canio was drawn to their local rivals [[S.S. Lazio]]. As a young boy, he was addicted to cola and similar drinks and called ''Pallocca'', a slang term meaning ''lard-ball''. He was fat, and knock-kneed, and needed to wear orthopedic shoes – "But I never hid. My response was to exercise; to try to become the kind of person I am."&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/paolo-di-canio-my-life-speaks-for-me-6273526.html |title=Paolo Di Canio: 'My life speaks for me' – Profiles – People |work=The Independent |date=11 December 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
He signed for [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in 1985 and remained there until 1990. Lazio won promotion to Serie A in 1988, having narrowly escaped relegation to [[Serie C1]] the year before. He finally made his first-team debut in October 1988 and went on to play 30 games during the [[1988–89 Serie A|1988–89 season]].&lt;ref name="ffile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12028/8936979/paolo-di-canio-factfile|title=Paolo Di Canio factfile|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 September 2013|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio scored the winner in the first [[Derby della Capitale|Rome derby]] of the season, a goal which contributed to Lazio's survival in Serie A that season and earning him hero status. In 1990, he was sold to another of Italy's biggest clubs, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]];&lt;ref name="ffile" /&gt; although he won the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] with the Turin side in 1993, he struggled to gain playing time during his tenure with the club, due to the presence of other forwards and creative midfielders in the team, such as [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Salvatore Schillaci]], [[Pierluigi Casiraghi]], [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]], [[Gianluca Vialli]], and [[Andreas Möller]].&lt;ref name=tuttojuve.com/&gt; He left Juventus after an "animated exchange" with then manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]&lt;ref name="independent1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="agr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Stewart|title=Is Di Canio a martyr or does he have a hidden agenda?|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/is-di-canio-a-martyr-or-does-he-have-a-hidden-agenda.20274802|publisher=Herald Scotland|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the [[1993–94 Serie A|1993–94]] season with [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref name="independent1" /&gt; Two seasons followed at [[A.C. Milan]], where, despite winning the [[1995–96 Serie A|Serie A title in 1996]], he once again struggled to gain playing time due to heavy competition from his teammates, culminating in another row, this time with [[Fabio Capello]].&lt;ref name="independent1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="agr" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tuttojuve.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paolo di Canio"/&gt;

===Celtic===
In July 1996 he joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in Scotland, and enjoyed a successful season in [[Glasgow]], scoring 15 goals in 37 appearances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haggerty|first=Anthony|title=Subbuteo team was reason I joined Celtic, admits Paolo Di Canio|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/subbuteo-team-was-reason-i-joined-celtic-1002987|publisher=Daily Record|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and winning the [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year|SPFA Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name="celt1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Di Canio’s Celtic years: good, bad and ugly|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/di-canio-s-celtic-years-good-bad-and-ugly-1-3106641|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=29 January 2014|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His time in Glasgow was dogged by controversy though; sent-off during a 2–2 draw against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in November 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo's Italian for loco|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1996-11-30%3A+Celtic+2-2+Hearts,+Premier+Division|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and heavily involved in an acrimonious league match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in March 1997 where he behaved aggressively towards [[Ian Ferguson (footballer born 1967)|Ian Ferguson]] and gestured in the direction of Rangers’ bench as he was led from the field by teammates.&lt;ref name="celt1" /&gt; The Italian was called to the referee’s room after the teams had returned to the dressing room and was shown another yellow card in addition to the one he had received earlier in the game.&lt;ref name="celt1" /&gt; Di Canio then demanded a large wage rise at the end of the season, but this was rebuffed by Celtic.&lt;ref name="celt1" /&gt;  He then refused to join the Celtic squad in the Netherlands for their pre-season training during July 1997.&lt;ref name="ffile" /&gt;

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 6 August 1997, Di Canio moved to the English [[Premier League|Premiership]] as he joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in a transfer deal valued at around £4.2 million.&lt;ref name="celt1" /&gt; Whilst in Sheffield, Di Canio was the club's leading goal scorer for the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] season with 14 goals and he became a favourite of the fans.

In September 1998, Di Canio pushed referee [[Paul Alcock]] to the ground after being sent off while playing for Sheffield Wednesday against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Hillsborough, which resulted in an extended ban of 11 matches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/199792.stm|title=Di Canio gets 11-match ban for push on ref |date=23 October 1998|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; and him being fined £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/199527.stm|title=Di Canio ban too short, say referees |date=24 October 1998|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
[[File:Paolo Di Canio playing at Tony Carr's testimonial, May 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Di Canio playing in [[Tony Carr]]'s testimonial match in 2010]]

In January 1999, Di Canio signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for £1.5 million. He had not played football since his ban following his push on Paul Alcock. West Ham manager, [[Harry Redknapp]] on signing Di Canio admitted he was taking a chance but said of the player "He can do things with the ball that people can only dream of". Di Canio said of his ban, "I made a mistake and I'm sorry, West Ham have given me a big chance and I'm very happy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/28/newsstory.sport | title=West Ham sign £1.5m Di Canio | work=The Guardian | date=28 January 1999 | accessdate=30 January 2014 | author=Brodkin, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for West Ham on 27 February 1999 in his fourth game. Playing against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], Di Canio made the first goal in a 2–0 win, for [[Ian Pearce]] in the 27th minute and scored the second in the 31st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://football.theguardian.com/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-12997,00.html | title=Di Canio strikes right note | work=The Guardian | date=27 February 1999 | accessdate=31 January 2014 | author=Callow, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped them to achieve a high league position (5th) and qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] through the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]]. He was also the OPTA player of the season [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]]. He scored the BBC [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] in March 2000 with a flying volley against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/westham/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/00/03/26/SOCCER_West_Ham.html&amp;TEAMHD=westham&amp;DIV=prem&amp;TEAM=WEST--HAM&amp;RH=West--Ham&amp;PREV_SEASON=1998 |title=West Ham 2 Wimbledon 1 |work=Sporting Life|location=UK |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still considered among the best goals in Premiership history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raynor |first=Dominic |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=688402&amp;cc=5739 |title=Paolo Di Canio: Explosive Italian |publisher=ESPN FC |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named as the Premiership's goal of the decade in a December 2009 [[Sky Sports News]] viewers' poll, scoring 30% of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

In December 2000, late in a game against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and with both sides vying for the winning goal, Di Canio shunned a goal-scoring opportunity and stopped play, grabbing the ball from a cross inside the [[penalty area|box]], as the Everton goalkeeper [[Paul Gerrard]] was laying injured on the ground after he twisted his knee attempting a clearance on the edge of the box. The [[Goodison Park]] crowd reacted with a standing ovation.  FIFA officially lauded Di Canio's gesture, describing it as "a special act of good sportsmanship,"&lt;ref name="Fair Play award"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1682501.stm |title=Di Canio wins Fair Play award |publisher=BBC News |date=17 December 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded him next year the [[FIFA Fair Play Award]].

[[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] tried to sign him for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] halfway through the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02 season]], but his attempts were unsuccessful and Di Canio remained in [[East End of London|East London]] for another season and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1023534_ferguson_21_that_got_away |title=Ferguson: 21 that got away – Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, with the Hammers struggling at the bottom of the league, Di Canio had a very public row with manager [[Glenn Roeder]] and was dropped from the first team. However, he returned at the end of the season (after Roeder, stricken by a brain tumour, was replaced by [[Trevor Brooking]]) and scored a winner against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the penultimate game of the season, a game that boosted West Ham's chances of staying in the Premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2968013.stm |title=Di Canio grabs West Ham lifeline |publisher=BBC News |date=3 May 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were relegated on the final day of the season after a 2–2 draw away to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], where Di Canio scored an 89th-minute equaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cc_championship/westham/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/03/05/11/SOCCER_Birmingham.html&amp;TEAMHD=westham&amp;DIV=nat1&amp;TEAM=WEST--HAM&amp;RH=West--Ham&amp;PREV_SEASON=2001 |title=Birmingham 2 West Ham 2 |work=Sporting Life|location=UK |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on a free transfer and signed  with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] for the start of [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]].&lt;ref name="ch1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Di Canio joins Charlton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/3142339.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=11 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlton Athletic===
In his one season at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]], Di Canio helped [[Charlton Athletic]] finish the season in 7th position, the club's highest league finish since the 1950s. However, he only scored four league goals for the Addicks, all of which came from the penalty spot (one from a rebound). one of the penalty kicks was an audacious '[[Antonín Panenka#Panenka penalty|Panenka]]' style penalty kick against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal back on top|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3206860.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=26 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Matt|title=Extra time with Paolo Di Canio|url=http://www.votvonline.com/back-issues/memories-of-paolo/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140130134621/http://www.votvonline.com/back-issues/memories-of-paolo/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 January 2014|publisher=Voice of the Valley|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Di Canio however continued to be a provider of goals as well, notably in October 2003 when he came on as second-half substitute with Charlton trailing 0–1 away at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. He provided most of the spark for Charlton's much-improved second-half display, and after [[Jonathan Fortune]] had equalised for Charlton, it was from Di Canio's corner kick in the last minute that [[Shaun Bartlett]] headed home the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlton snatch late win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3123632.stm|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=4 October 2003|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Jimmy|title=CAFC Moments: Di Canio inspires comeback|url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/20131121-cafc-moments-paolo-di-canio-1188285.aspx|publisher=cafc.co.uk|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=21 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201194633/http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/20131121-cafc-moments-paolo-di-canio-1188285.aspx|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Italy===
Even though he had already signed an extension to his Charlton contract, in August 2004 he returned to his home team of [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] taking a massive pay cut in order to return to the economically stretched Roman team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Di Canio apologises to Charlton|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-313592/Di-Canio-apologises-Charlton.html|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=30 January 2014|location=London|date=11 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lazio fans were happy to have a Rome-bred Lazio supporter in the team again, something missing since the departure of [[Alessandro Nesta]] in 2002. He scored in the [[Rome derby]], just as he had in 1989, leading the team to a 3–1 victory over [[A.S. Roma]] in January (6 January 2005). However the negative publicity that Di Canio generated for Lazio, including his intimate relationship with club's [[ultras]] and their increased influence thanks to his presence in the team, coupled with problems with some teammates and coaches, exasperated club president and majority shareholder, [[Claudio Lotito]], with whom he already had a difficult relationship. As a result, Di Canio's contract was not renewed in the summer of 2006. During several of his games for Lazio – including during [[goal celebration]]s – Di Canio made a fascist salute to their right-wing fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I'm a fascist, not a racist, says Paolo di Canio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1506262/Im-a-fascist-not-a-racist-says-Paolo-di-Canio.html |accessdate=9 October 2018 |work=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently signed with [[Atletico Roma F.C.|Cisco Roma]] of [[Serie C2]] on a free transfer. In his first season with Cisco Roma, his team failed promotion to playoffs, despite a runners-up position in the regular season. He subsequently agreed to stay with Cisco for another season, in a second attempt to win promotion to [[Serie C1]] with the Roman side.

On 10 March 2008, Di Canio announced his retirement from football, ending his 23-year playing career before the end of the season due to physical issues. It was his intention to begin coaching lessons at [[Coverciano]] to gain a coaching position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.eurosport.yahoo.com/10032008/44/canio-smette-giocare-addio-cisco-roma-86.html|title=Di Canio Smette di giocare, addio alla Cisco Roma|date=10 March 2008|publisher=[[Eurosport|Yahoo!

==Managerial career==
===Swindon Town===
[[File:Paolo Di Canio at Upton Park.jpg|thumb|upright|Di Canio at the [[Boleyn Ground]], [[Upton Park, London|Upton Park]] in 2010]]

On 20 May 2011, Di Canio was appointed manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on a two-year contract, following the club's relegation to League Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swindon Town confirm Paolo Di Canio as new manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13466915 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio began his career as a manager with a 3–0 win over [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on 6 August 2011.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On 30 August 2011, Di Canio was involved in a pitch-side altercation with Swindon striker [[Leon Clarke]] after their defeat in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/sport/sportlatest/9226141.Time_called_on_Clarke/ |title=Time called on Clarke  |work=Swindon Advertiser |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Swindon caused a [[2011–12 FA Cup|FA Cup]] shock by defeating [[Premier League]] club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 2–1. Di Canio stated that he believed his players deserved to have their names put on the stadium and dedicated the victory to his father, who died late in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16372054.stm | title=Swindon 2 – 1 Wigan | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | date=7 January 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to the stands later in the month in a league game against [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] for vociferously venting his frustration at his side not being awarded a free-kick. Swindon won the match 1–0 and with over half the season gone, his team were fighting for promotion to [[Football League One|League One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16559842.stm | title=Swindon 1 – 0 Macclesfield | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | date=21 January 2012 | accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Di Canio, Swindon reached the [[2012 Football League Trophy Final]], where they were defeated 2–0 by [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 21 April 2012, Swindon were promoted to the League One after [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]]'s 1–1 draw with [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]] and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]]'s 2–0 loss to [[AFC Wimbledon]], despite Di Canio's side having lost 3–1 to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on the same day.

Although in the 2012–13 season, Swindon were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] and the [[Football League Trophy]] in their first game against opposition from lower leagues, they did have a solid run in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in which they won against three teams from higher leagues. They beat [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] 3–0, won against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 3–4 [[Overtime (sports)|after extra time]], and beat [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 3–1 before narrowly missing out against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 3–2 at home.

In January 2013, with Swindon under a transfer embargo and in financial difficulty, Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players [[John Bostock]], [[Chris Martin (footballer born 1988)|Chris Martin]], and [[Danny Hollands]] at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paolo Di Canio offers own money to keep Swindon players|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20928212|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2013, ahead of Swindon's Saturday clash with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], Di Canio worked into the night alongside approximately 200 volunteers to clear a snow-covered pitch at the [[County Ground, Swindon|County Ground]], thus allowing the game to go ahead. He showed his appreciation by ordering everyone pizza. Swindon won the match 2–0, which Di Canio publicly deemed a present to the volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/01/19/paolo-di-canio-shovels-snow-off-swindon-pitch-and-orders-pizza-for-helpers-3358148/ | title=Paolo Di Canio shovels snow off Swindon pitch and orders pizza for helpers | publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date=19 January 2013 | accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/news/article/pdcvictoryapresent-608835.aspx | title=PDC – Victory a present | publisher=Swindon Town FC | date=19 January 2013 | accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/news/article/shrewsgameon-607948.aspx | title=Shrewsbury game on | publisher=Swindon Town FC | date=19 January 2013 | accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the Swindon Town chairman announced that due to financial difficulties, no money would be made available for future signings. Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players at the club. With the possibility of the club entering administration, a new buyer was found, subject to Football League approval, and without the knowledge of Di Canio, player [[Matt Ritchie]] was sold to [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. Further attempts to sign players by Di Canio were rejected by the Football League due to the club's financial situation with Di Canio "considering his future" at Swindon due to off-field financial problems. In February, Di Canio offered his resignation but said he would withdraw this if approval for the new owners, by the Football League, was received by 18 February. This did not happen and he resigned as manager of Swindon Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paolo Di Canio quits as manager of Swindon Town |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21499926 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunderland===
On 31 March 2013, [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] appointed Di Canio as manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract, following the dismissal of [[Martin O'Neill]] the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paolo Di Canio appointed Sunderland head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21990117 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 March 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club vice-chairman [[David Miliband]] due to Di Canio's "past political statements".&lt;ref name="miliband"&gt;{{cite news|title=David Miliband quits Sunderland FC in Di Canio protest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/01/david-miliband-resign-sunderland-di-canio|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2013|accessdate=1 April 2013|location=London|first=Ben|last=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of Di Canio also sparked opposition from the [[Durham Miners' Association]],&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-22049080 | work=BBC News | title=Miners' Di Canio protest 'will only end with Sunderland campaign support' | date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's [[Stadium of Light]], which is built on the former site of the [[Wearmouth Colliery]], as a symbol of its anger over the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/62109/durham-miners-association-our-issues-with-di-canio-now-resolved Durham Miners' Association: Our Issues With Di Canio At Sunderland Now Resolved - Sky Tyne and Wear&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625103549/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/62109/durham-miners-association-our-issues-with-di-canio-now-resolved |date=25 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/02/paolo-di-canio-sunderland-miners-banner | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | title=Sunderland miners demand return of banner after Paolo Di Canio's arrival | date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background to the opposition was past statements made by Di Canio supporting [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/miners-join-opposition-to-paolo-di-canios-appointment-at-sunderland-8556525.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Miners join opposition to Paolo Di Canio's appointment at Sunderland | date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Canio was tasked with keeping Sunderland in the [[Premier League]], following a run of only three points from a possible 24. His first game as manager of Sunderland resulted in a 2–1 away defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/8624046/Premier-League-round-u | work=Sky Sports | title=Premier League round-up – Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio's second game in charge was the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at [[St James' Park]] on 14 April. Sunderland defeated their fierce rivals 3–0, their first away victory in the fixture in over a decade. Each goal sparked wild celebrations from Di Canio and the Sunderland bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22056537|title= Newcastle 0 Sunderland 3|date=14 April 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio then got his first win at the Stadium of Light against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/10007646/Sunderland-1-Everton-0-match-report.html|title=Sunderland 1 Everton 0|date=20 April 2013|work=Daily Telegraph

Although the team did not win the next three matches, including drawing the final two home games and a heavy 6–1 defeat to [[Aston Villa]], Sunderland secured their Premier League survival when [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] were defeated at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and relegated, trailing then-17th placed Sunderland by four points with only one game to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130514/football-podolski-double-condemns-wigan-relegation-0|title=Podolski double condemns Wigan to relegation|date=14 May 2013|work=Global Post

For the [[2013–14 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2013–14]] season, Di Canio signed fourteen new players and sold experienced players such as [[Simon Mignolet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/10142422/Liverpool-sign-Sunderland-goalkeeper-Simon-Mignolet.html | title=Liverpool sign Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet | publisher=Daily Telegraph | date=25 June 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 | author=Edwards, Luke | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James McClean]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23631972 | title=Wigan: James McClean took pay cut to join - Owen Coyle | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stéphane Sessègnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sunderland/10322293/Sunderland-manager-Paolo-Di-Canio-I-had-to-sell-Stephane-Sessegnon-to-West-Bromwich-Albion.html | title=Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio: I had to sell Stephane Sessegnon to West Bromwich Albion | publisher=Daily Telegraph | date=20 September 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 | author=Edwards, Luke | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five league games, Sunderland had gained only a single point, from an away draw with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23737155 | title=Southampton 1-1 Sunderland | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio was dismissed on 22 September 2013, the day after the fifth match of the season, a 3–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], and only his 13th match in charge.&lt;ref name="Paolo Di Canio: Sunderland reign that lasted only six months"&gt;{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Rose |title=Paolo Di Canio: Sunderland reign that lasted only six months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24199482 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunderland chief executive officer Margaret Byrne stated that Di Canio had been sacked after senior players had approached her and that his situation became untenable due to his "brutal and vitriolic" criticism of the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24214706 | title=Paolo Di Canio: Sunderland players met CEO before sacking | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio denies this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24356449|title=Paolo Di Canio denies bust-up with players caused Sunderland exit|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent managerial links===
Di Canio was linked with the [[Celtic FC|Celtic]] job in May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/26/paolo-di-canio-celtic-manager|title=Paolo Di Canio puts himself forward for Celtic manager’s job|date=26 May 2014|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied for vacant managerial positions at [[Bolton Wanderers]] in October 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/08/paolo-di-canio-neil-lennon-bolton-wanderers|title=Paolo Di Canio and Neil Lennon apply for job as Bolton Wanderers manager|last=Hunter|first=Andy|date=8 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotherham United]] in September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/30/paolo-di-canio-reject-rotherham-united|title=Rotherham reject approach from Paolo Di Canio over manager’s job|date=30 September 2015|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rotherham again in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/08/paolo-di-canio-rotherham-job|title=Paolo Di Canio applies for Rotherham manager job for second time|date=8 February 2016|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In 2005, he characterised his political views by declaring that he was "a fascist, not a racist".&lt;ref name="telegraphreport"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenton |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1506262/Im-a-fascist-not-a-racist-says-Paolo-di-Canio.html |title=I'm a fascist, not a racist, says Paolo di Canio |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 December 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His use of the [[Roman salute]] toward [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] supporters, a gesture adopted by [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascists]] in the 20th century, has created controversy. Documented uses of the salute include in matches against arch-rivals [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], a club inclined to left-wing politics.&lt;ref name="Kassimeris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassimeris|first=Christos |title=European football in black and white: tackling racism in football |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2008|page=70|isbn=9780739119600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Canio received a one-match ban after the second event and was fined €7,000.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bar-On|first=Tamir |title=Where have all the fascists gone?|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2007|page=1|isbn=9780754671541}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later quoted as saying, "I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people ... I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardisation that this society imposes upon us."&lt;ref name="Nursey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-139900733 |title=Football: ll Di Canio new salute row |last=Nursey |first=James |date=19 December 2005 |work=Daily Mirror |location=London (UK), |accessdate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His salute has been featured on unofficial merchandise sold outside [[Stadio Olimpico]] after the ban.&lt;ref name="Kassimeris" /&gt;

He has also expressed admiration for the fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. In his autobiography, he praised Mussolini as "basically a very principled, ethical individual" who was "deeply misunderstood".&lt;ref name="independentarticle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio: 'My life speaks for me'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/paolo-di-canio-my-life-speaks-for-me-6273526.html|work=The Independent|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=1 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4158591.stm|title=Footballer's 'fascist salute' row |last=Duff|first=Mark|date=9 January 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1506262/Im-a-fascist-not-a-racist-says-Paolo-di-Canio.html|title=I'm a fascist, not a racist, says Paolo di Canio|last=Fenton|first=Ben |date=24 December 2005|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Di Canio attended the funeral of senior fascist Paolo Signorelli, where mourners were photographed making mass fascist salutes towards Signorelli's coffin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/4878249/Di-Canio-is-ugly-side-of-beautiful-game.html Di Canio is ugly side of beautiful game | The Sun |Scottish News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/news/article/2644/paolo-di-canio-at-bomb-fascists-funeral HOPE not hate news: Paolo Di Canio at bomb fascist’s funeral&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406032230/http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/news/article/2644/paolo-di-canio-at-bomb-fascists-funeral |date=6 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2303650/Paolo-Di-Canio-attends-funeral-fascist-bomber.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Di Canio says he's not one... but why was he at the funeral of an Italian fascist bomber?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4870918/Paolo-Di-Canio-at-bomb-fascists-funeral.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Robin | last=Perrie | title=Exclusive: Paolo Di Canio at bomb fascist’s funeral – The Sun –News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signorelli had been convicted of involvement in the [[Bologna massacre]], a neo-fascist terrorist attack which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200.

Di Canio's political ideology has been a source of controversy in the course of his managerial career. When Di Canio was appointed as the manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2011, the trade union [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] terminated its sponsorship agreement with the club, worth around £4,000 per season, due to Di Canio's fascist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1389305/Sponsors-cut-ties-Swindon-Paolo-di-Canios-fascist-views.html|title=Sponsors cut ties with Swindon over Paolo di Canio's fascist views|last=Mokbel|first=Sami |date=21 May 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=21 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as manager of [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] on 31 March 2013. The club's vice-chairman [[David Miliband]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]], subsequently stepped down. Miliband stated that he had taken the decision to resign "in the light of the new manager's past political statements".&lt;ref name="miliband" /&gt;

In a profile piece in 2011, an unnamed source asserted that Di Canio was not "an ideological fascist", attributing his behaviour to "his psychological history, particularly his former compulsive tendencies and pronounced mood swings". In the same article, Di Canio said that he was not politically active: "I don't vote, I haven't voted for 14 years. Italian politicians — all of them — think only about themselves, and making money."&lt;ref name="independentarticle" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Di Canio has several tattoos, including on his right [[biceps]] the [[Latin language|Latin]] word "''DUX''", meaning "''leader''" or, in Italian, [[duce|Il Duce]]—a nickname for [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=Tatts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/political%2Bfootball%2Bpaolo%2Bdi%2Bcanio/1643547.html |title=Political Football: Paolo Di Canio|date=26 April 2008|publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky Italia|Sky Sport Italia]] was forced to apologize after Di Canio appeared as a pundit in September 2016 in a short-sleeved shirt, thus revealing the tattoo to television viewers; he was later suspended by the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/sky-sport-italia-suspends-paolo-di-canio-after-showing-dux-tattoo|title=Sky Sport Italia suspends Paolo Di Canio after showing ‘dux’ tattoo|last=Dobson|first=Mark|date=14 September 2016|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His back is covered with a tattoo of fascist imagery, including an eagle, [[fasces]] and a portrait of Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2305295/Paolo-Di-Canio-tattoo-Just-days-renouncing-fascism-Mussolini-design-revealed.html|title=Paolo Di Canio Tattoo: Just days after renouncing fascisme, Mussolini Design Revealed|date=7 April 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=2013-06-11|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] tattoo on his left upper arm&lt;ref name=Tatts2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1388312/Paolo-Di-Canio-wants-West-Ham-job.html|title=I'm on my way to England!

Di Canio has spoken also of the growing influence in his life of [[Samurai]] culture, and of the Japanese spiritual mentality from reading [[Yukio Mishima|Mishima]], and the teachings in the traditions of [[Hagakure]] and [[Bushido]].&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

'''Alan Ernest Devonshire''' (born 13 April 1956) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who is the current manager of [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]]. He was a wide [[midfielder]] who played for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], with whom he won the [[FA Cup]] in 1980, and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he finished his career in 1992. Devonshire won eight caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1980 and 1983. He subsequently became a manager with Maidenhead United, [[Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C.|Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough]] and [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]].

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Park Royal]], then a part of [[Middlesex]], Devonshire had been a schoolboy footballer but had been turned away by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at age 14 for being too small.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}} He returned to [[Selhurst Park]] two years later and played a couple of youth team games but was again released by the club, this time by former West Ham player and Palace manager, [[Malcolm Allison]]. Devonshire started playing for non-league [[Southall F.C.|Southall]] and in doing so came to the attention of [[Football League|league]] clubs such as [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}} By day he worked as a fork-lift truck driver at the [[Hoover Building|Hoover Factory]] in [[Perivale]], Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United [[Scout (sport)|scout]]s, [[Eddie Baily]] and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, [[Ron Greenwood]]. Devonshire signed for West Ham United in 1976 for a fee of £5,000, a transfer which has led to him being referred to as "West Ham's best ever buy".{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

===West Ham United===
Devonshire made his debut for West Ham on 27 October 1976 in a League Cup tie against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], in which West Ham lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3002&amp;united=27_Oct_1976 |title=Game played on 27 Oct 1976 |publisher=Westhamstats.info |date=27 October 1976 |accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his League debut three days later on 30 October 1976 against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], where he played in a 3–0 defeat.  He soon became a fans' favourite, who referred to him by his nickname "Dev". His workman-like attitude was one to which the fans could relate. He also enhanced his rapport with supporters by travelling to home game on the [[London Underground]] from his West London home.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

He played 29 games in all competitions, without scoring, in his first season, the [[1976-77 in English football|1976–77]] season. It was a poor season for West Ham who finished only two points above a relegation place in 17th place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref name="WHU7677"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1977&amp;united=1st_Division_1976-77 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1st Division 1976–77 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the [[1977-78 in English football|1977–78]] season saw Devonshire's first goals for the club, in a 3–3 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] on 12 November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3051&amp;united=12_Nov_1977 | title=Game played 12 November 1977 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw him play 38 games in all competitions, scoring three goals. Unfortunately for West Ham his efforts could not prevent them from relegation to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after they finished in 20th place.&lt;ref name="WHU197778"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1978&amp;united=1st_Division_1977-78 | title= Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1st Division | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1978-79 in English football|1978–79]] season saw West Ham rebuilding their side following relegation. Devonshire was a regular member of the side which finished 5th in the Second Division. He had played 41 of a possible 42 league games that season and was voted [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Season|Hammer of the Season]].&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHU7879"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1979&amp;united=2nd_Division_1978-79 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1978–79 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham failed to gain promotion again in the [[1979-80 in English football|1979–80 season]]. They did however reach the [[1980 FA Cup Final]] where Devonshire collected an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal as West Ham beat favourites, holders and Cup Winners Cup finalists [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] with a single goal from [[Trevor Brooking]] from a cross by Devonshire. He had also scored a goal in a semi-final replay at [[Elland Road]] in a 2–1 win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref name="efcsemi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3176&amp;united=16_Apr_1980 | title=Game played on 16 Apr 1980 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1980shock"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8435400.stm | title=When the Hammers shocked Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 January 2010 | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

In the [[1980-81 in English football|1980–81 season]] Devonshire's career flourished. His partnership with Trevor Brooking formed the cornerstone of West Ham's push for promotion back to the First Division. He also played in [[West Ham United F.C. in European football|European football]] for the first time and was a member of the side which reached to [[1981 Football League Cup Final|1981 League Cup Final]]. He collected a Second Division title medal as they won promotion, losing only four games.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=55}} Devonshire continued to be a regular member of the West Ham side in the First Division until a game on 7 January 1984. Playing against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the FA Cup, he snapped three [[ligament]]s in his right knee. He tried to make a comeback in March 1985 in two cup games against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] but again broke down. It was 19 months from his first injury to his full return, in a game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 17 August 1985.&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=186&amp;united=Alan_Devonshire | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Alan Devonshire | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His long spell out injured had resulted in him losing some of his pace but still maintaining his ability to pass the ball well. He made the [[Assist (football)|final pass]] for many of the goals scored by teammates, [[Tony Cottee]] and [[Frank McAvennie]] in the [[1985-86 in English football|1985–86 season]] as West Ham finished third in the First Division.&lt;ref name="WHU8586"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1986&amp;united=1st_Division_1985-86 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics – 1st Division 1985–86 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury struck Devonshire again in the first game of the [[1987-88 in English football|1987–88]] season. Just 15 minutes in a game against Queens Park Rangers, he snapped his [[Achilles tendon]]. This forced him out of the game for over a year and by the time of his return the West Ham team were in decline. The [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]] season saw him play only 20 league game without scoring as West Ham were relegated back to the Second Division.&lt;ref name="WHU8889"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1989&amp;united=1st_Division_1988-89 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics – 1st Division 1988–89 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1989-90 in English football|1989–90]] season manager [[John Lyall]] was replaced by [[Lou Macari]] who undertook the rebuilding of the West Ham side. Devonshire was rarely used making only seven league appearances that season. Macari was replaced in the same season by [[Billy Bonds]] who granted Devonshire a free transfer in May 1990.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=55}} His last appearance for West Ham came on 14 February 1990 when he was a substitute for [[Gary Strodder]] in a 6–0 away defeat to [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in a League Cup semi-final. His performance, and that of other experienced West Ham players, [[Liam Brady]], [[Phil Parkes (footballer, born 1950)|Phil Parkes]], [[Alvin Martin]] and [[Julian Dicks]], was described as "embarrassingly helpless" in a game known as the "St. Valentine's Day massacre".{{sfn|Blows|2000|p=174}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/15/joy-of-six-league-cup-semi-finals | title=The Joy of Six: League Cup semi-finals | work=The Guardian | date=15 January 2010 | accessdate=26 December 2013 | author=Smyth, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3684&amp;united=14_Feb_1990 | title=Game played on 14 Feb 1990 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devonshire had played 448 competitive games over 14 years, scoring 32 goals.&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"/&gt;

===Watford===
In 1990 Devonshire signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he played for two years before dropping out of league football in 1992.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watfordfcarchive.com/downloads/players/+Cullip-Dickson.pdf |title=Watford Football Club archive 1881–2017 » Players – Cullip to Dickson |page=36 |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve non-league club Chippenham Sports as a player-coach.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive" /&gt;

==International career==
Devonshire was selected to play for [[England national football team|England]] by his former manager at West Ham, Ron Greenwood. He made his debut on 20 May 1980 in a 1–1 draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="englandint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=309 |title=Alan Devonshire England |publisher=www.englandfc.com |accessdate=26 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212811/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=309 |archivedate=4 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood selected him again on 31 May 1980 in a friendly game against [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], which England won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=England | url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/alan-devonshire-4684/biography-1980-83_a11309/ | publisher=www.sportingheroes.net | accessdate=26 December 2013 | author=Rudd, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Devonshire his position and style of play were also those of [[Glenn Hoddle]] who was preferred as an international selection. He would have to wait two years for his next cap, on 25 May 1982 in a 2–0 win against [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Another game followed on 2 June 1982, a 1–1 draw against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Both of these games were warm-up games before the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]]. Devonshire was omitted from the final squad for the tournament. New England manager, [[Bobby Robson]] attempting to rebuild an aging England team, selected Devonshire in October 1982. The game, against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] finished 2–1 to the Germans in a bad defeat for England.&lt;ref name=englandint/&gt; His final two appearances, against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] came towards the end of 1983 and were Devonshire's only appearances in competitive international games, the games being qualifiers for the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/luxembourg-v-england-16-november-1983-238156/ | title=Luxemburg v England 16 November 1983 | publisher=www.11v11.com | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management career==
Devonshire began his management career as manager of non-league club Osterley and Brentford Women.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive" /&gt; He then became the manager of [[Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C.|Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough]] in the [[Conference South]]. He was previously manager of [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]].

As manager of Hampton &amp; Richmond, he took the club from [[Isthmian League Division One South]] to the play-off-final of the Conference South. In his first season, he guided them to fifth place in the Isthmian Division One South which due to re-organization of the leagues was enough to see the club promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]]. He then guided the club to a sixth-placed finish in their debut season at that level missing out on the play-offs on goal difference on the final day of the season. The 2005–06 season would see Devonshire take the team into the play-offs. Having won a dramatic play-off semi-final on penalties away to [[Heybridge Swifts F.C.|Heybridge Swifts]] the team then faced [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] away who beat Hampton 3–0.
