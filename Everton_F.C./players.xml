However, after Mannone suffered a serious arm injury in training, Pickford started Sunderland's third league match of the season, away to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He produced several saves during the match, but in the 85th minute he made an error which allowed [[Jay Rodriguez]] to equalise for the hosts in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3761414/Southampton-1-1-Sunderland-Super-sub-Jay-Rodriguez-strikes-level-Jermain-Defore-penalty-Saints-grandstand-finish-t-force-victory.html |title=Southampton 1–1 Sunderland: David Moyes refuses to deny interest in Joe Hart after Jordan Pickford error costs Black Cats first win in August since 2010 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2016}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echo_October2016"/&gt; On 13 April 2017, Pickford was named as one of six players shortlisted for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thepfa.com/news/2017/4/13/pfa-mens-young-player-of-the-year |title=Men's PFA Young Player of the Year 2017 |date=13 April 2017 |publisher=Professional Footballers' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial fee of £25&amp;nbsp;million, with the possibility of rising to £30&amp;nbsp;million in add-ons, made him [[Goalkeeper (association football)#Highest fees|the third most expensive goalkeeper in history]], the most expensive British goalkeeper of all time and will make him Everton's second most expensive signing, pending add-on payments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan Pickford: Everton confirm £25m, rising to £30m, deal with Sunderland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40258852 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Gylfi Sigurðsson]] is currently the club's most expensive signing with £40&amp;nbsp;million plus add-on payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40848343 |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson: Everton sign £45m deal for Swansea midfielder |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickford made his league debut for Everton on 12 August 2017, when his club beat [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 1–0 at Goodison Park.&lt;ref name=sb1718/&gt; At the conclusion of his first season, he was named Everton's Player of the Season, along with numerous other club accolades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11355385/jordan-pickford-honoured-after-dominating-everton-awards-night |title=Jordan Pickford 'honoured' after dominating Everton awards night |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 May 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
On 2 December 2018, against [[Merseyside derby|local rivals]] [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Pickford made a last-minute mistake after he mishandled a volley from [[Virgil van Dijk]], allowing [[Divock Origi]] to score the winning goal for Liverpool from a close-range header in the 96th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46333097 |title=Liverpool 1–0 Everton: Jordan Pickford error gifts Divock Origi late winner |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2018 |accessdate=12 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-everton-jordan-pickford-mistake-goal-error-divock-origi-a8664181.html |title= Liverpool vs Everton: Jordan Pickford explains what he was trying to do in 'freak' mistake |publisher=The Independent |date=2 December 2018 |accessdate=12 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2019, against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Pickford misjudged a cross from [[Matt Ritchie]] and then [[Tackle (football move)#Rugby union|rugby tackle]]d [[Salomón Rondón]], conceding a penalty. He quickly redeemed himself by saving Ritchie's penalty with his legs, and Everton doubled their lead a minute later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/03/09/villain-hero-scapegoat-jordan-pickford-spotlight-newcastle/ |title=From villain, to hero, to scapegoat - Jordan Pickford in the spotlight as Newcastle fight back to stun Everton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=9 March 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half, when an effort by Rondón went wide of the post, Pickford was seen smiling at the Newcastle fans in the Gallowgate end. However, he conceded three times after that, including parrying a shot by [[Miguel Almirón]] into the path of [[Ayoze Pérez]]. On ''[[Match of the Day]]'', [[Ian Wright]] suggested that Pickford should have focused on his game more, and given he was a former Sunderland player, not let his emotions affect him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47424848|title=Newcastle United 3–2 Everton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 March 2019|accessdate=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines started his career with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], and was part of the team that won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the [[2002–03 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2002–03 season]] and was a runner-up in the [[2004–05 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2004–05]] [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and the [[2006 Football League Cup Final|2006 League Cup Final]].

==Club career==
===Wigan Athletic===
Baines made his debut for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2002, and was a member of the team that won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the [[2002–03 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2002–03 season]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He was a regular in the first team when Wigan earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] in [[2004–05 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2004–05]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} That season saw Baines score his first goal for the club, a long-range shot against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

When he secured promotion with Wigan, he doubted he was good enough to play in the Premier League: "We won promotion to the Premier League and, straight away, I was thinking, 'Where am I going to go now?' I should have been celebrating but I spent a large part of that summer worrying about what it would be like spending the next year on the bench and in the reserves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|title=Baines thriving after test of his fragile nerve|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/29/newsstory.everton|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines signed a new contract with Wigan in February 2005 despite being linked to a number of Premier League clubs, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines commits to Latics |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=254724&amp;plid=12745&amp;clid=111&amp;cpid=10 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=23 September 2006 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended his contract again after impressive displays in his first season in the Premier League.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Whilst at Wigan he started in the [[2006 Football League Cup Final|2006 League Cup Final]] defeat to Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/4727118.stm|title=Man Utd ease to Carling Cup glory|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
[[File:Leighton Baines throw-in.jpg|thumb|upright|Baines playing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009]]

In July 2007, Baines rejected a move to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], after their bid of a reported £6&amp;nbsp;million was accepted by Wigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines rejects Sunderland switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6288856.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 July 2007 | date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month he signed for Everton for an initial fee of £5&amp;nbsp;million, with another £1&amp;nbsp;million in add-ons, dependent on Baines's appearances for Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines joins Everton |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_2643417,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6934188.stm |title=Everton capture Baines from Wigan |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines did not play regularly in his first season, making just 29 appearances in all competitions, due to an injury and the good form of [[Phil Jagielka]] and [[Joseph Yobo]] at centre back which kept [[Joleon Lescott]] at left back.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} His second season at Everton saw an increase in Baines's playing time.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Due to an injury to Yobo, Lescott moved to the centre of defence and Baines played at left back.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He was voted Player of the Month at Everton two months in a row in the 2008–09 season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Baines scored his first ever Everton goal against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 21 March, at [[Fratton Park]], after 57 matches (in all competitions) without scoring.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 30 August 2009, he scored a last minute [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in a 2–1 win over his former team Wigan.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A month later, he [[captain (association football)|captained]] Everton for the first time in a [[UEFA Europa League]] match against [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000037/match=2000779/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032540/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season%3D2010/round%3D2000037/match%3D2000779/index.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=21 February 2010 |title=Everton revived on Europa League stage |publisher=UEFA |date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2010–11 Everton F.C. season|2010–11 season]], Baines played every minute of Everton's Premier League matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/26/premier-league-opta-statistics|title=Number-crunching makes grim reading for Arsenal's defence|first=Paul|last=Doyle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as scoring seven goals in all competitions. His contribution was rewarded with the club's Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season, and Goal of the Season awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/player-of-season|title=Baines' Glorious Treble|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], scored from direct free kick, was voted Everton Goal of the Season.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He also contributed 11 assists throughout the season, 5th overall in the league, and was the league's highest assisting defender.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Leighton Baines 2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baines playing for Everton in 2011]]

Baines scored five times during [[2011–12 Everton F.C. season|2011–12]], four of which were penalties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He reached 99 consecutive league matches before ending his season early due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/19/everton-leighton-baines-euro-2012 | title=Everton's Leighton Baines hamstrung but should be fit for Euro 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian | date=19 April 2012 | accessdate=23 April 2012 | author=Hunter, Andy | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance at left back was deemed impressive enough to be named in the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]]'s Premier League Team of the Year in 2012, the first Everton player to do so for 22 years since [[Neville Southall]] in 1989–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/22/robin-van-persie-pfa-player-of-year | title=Arsenal's Robin van Persie is honoured to win PFA player of year award |newspaper=The Guardian | date=23 April 2012 | accessdate=23 April 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2015, Zouma was a 69th-minute substitute for [[César Azpilicueta]] as Chelsea lost 1–0 to [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2015 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cryer|first1=Andy|title=Arsenal 1–0 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33667216|accessdate=2 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting ahead of John Terry, he scored his first Premier League goal on 19 September, heading in [[Cesc Fàbregas]]' cross to open a 2–0 home win over the same opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Chelsea 2–0 Arsenal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34191867|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, as a late substitute for the injured Terry, he scored his first European goal to conclude a 4–0 win at [[Maccabi Tel Aviv]] in the Champions League [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Gary|title=M'bi Tel Aviv 0–4 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34896622|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under interim manager [[Guus Hiddink]], Zouma regularly started alongside Terry as Chelsea's form improved. On 7 February 2016, Zouma ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee after landing awkwardly from a jump in a match against [[Manchester United]]. He required surgery and was ruled out for six months.&lt;ref name=injury&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurt Zouma: Chelsea defender out for six months &amp; needs surgery|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35527443|accessdate=9 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Zouma traveled and trained with the first-team during preseason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/07/zouma--coming-back-stronger.html |title=Zouma: Coming back stronger |date=20 July 2016 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea also rejected a loan offer from [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/704672/Chelsea-Antonio-Conte-Schalke-Kurt-Zouma-Premier-League-John-Terry-Gary-Cahill-News |title=Chelsea in talks with Schalke over transfer of young defender |date=28 August 2016|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, Zouma made his first competitive appearance after being out of action for nine months, playing 45 minutes for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Chelsea under-23]] side in a 2–2 draw against Derby County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/10/pl2-report--chelsea-v-derby-county.html |title=PL2 report: Chelsea 2 Derby 2 |date=24 October 2016 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2017, Zouma made his first team comeback in Chelsea's 4–1 [[2016–17 FA Cup|FA Cup]] third-round win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/chelsea-peterborough-united-fa-cup-match-report|title=John Terry sees red but comfortable Chelsea ease past Peterborough|date=9 January 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, he made his first appearance of the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season as a substitute in a 3–1 win against rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/feb/04/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-live|title=Chelsea 3–1 Arsenal|date=1 March 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season: Loan to Stoke City====
Following agreeing to a new six-year deal with Chelsea, on 21 July 2017, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on loan for the [[2017–18 Stoke City F.C. season|2017–18]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zouma signs new deal and heads to Stoke |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/07/new-contract-and-loan-for-zouma.html |publisher=Chelsea Official Site |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurt Zouma: Chelsea defender joins Stoke on season-long loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40684771|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August, he made his debut in a 1–0 loss at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/everton-vs-stoke/373101 |title=Everton 1–0 Stoke |date=12 August 2017 |publisher=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Stoke captain [[Ryan Shawcross]] expressed his surprise that Chelsea had loaned out Zouma, who had only missed one match, against his parent club.&lt;ref name=shawcross&gt;{{cite news|title=Ryan Shawcross surprised Chelsea allowed 'ultimate defender' Kurt Zouma to leave on loan|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11701/11128404/ryan-shawcross-surprised-chelsea-allowed-ultimate-defender-kurt-zouma-to-leave-on-loan|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=Sky Sports|date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November he headed his first goal for the Potters, in a 2–2 draw at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bysouth|first1=Alex|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2–2 Stoke City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41964596|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma played 37 matches for Stoke in 2017–18 as the club suffered relegation to the [[EFL Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swansea 1–2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44020155|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season: Loan to Everton====
On 10 August 2018, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan for the [[2018–19 Everton F.C. season|2018–19]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/08/10/zouma|title=Zouma Joins Everton On Season-Long Loan|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018|publisher=Everton Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 25 August as a last-minute substitute for the injured [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]] in a 2–2 draw at [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutcliffe |first1=Steve |title=Bournemouth 2&amp;ndash;2 Everton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45230638 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zouma scored his first goal for Everton on 13 January 2019, a header to open a 2–0 home win also against Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunter |first1=Andy |title=Kurt Zouma nods home to steer Everton towards nervy win over Bournemouth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off for dissent after the final whistle in a 1–0 loss at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 9 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prentice |first1=David |title=Everton defender Kurt Zouma red-carded AFTER the final whistle at Watford |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-defender-kurt-zouma-red-15806796 |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Zouma is a [[France national youth football team|France youth international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] and [[France national under-17 football team|under-17]] level. He played with the under-17 team at the [[2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] and [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Zouma has been the captain for the [[France national under-21 football team|French under-21]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zouma strike makes it a perfect six for France|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000412/match=2011566/postmatch/report/index.html|publisher=UEFA|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[France national under-20 football team|under-20 team]] that won the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2013 World Cup]] in Turkey. In the quarter-finals against [[Uzbekistan national under-20 football team|Uzbekistan]] in [[Rize]], he headed the last goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbeks no match for in-form France|url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/matches/round=259231/match=300234903/match-report.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=FIFA|date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] wanted to build a defence around Zouma and fellow youngster [[Raphaël Varane]],&lt;ref name=four/&gt; and on 19 March 2015, he was called him up for the first time for friendlies against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=Nabil Fekir and Kurt Zouma named in France squad for friendlies|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/international-friendly/story/2356374/nabil-fekir-and-kurt-zouma-named-in-france-squad-for-friendlies|accessdate=20 March 2015|publisher=ESPN|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the latter match ten days later, a 2–0 win at his former club ground with Saint-Étienne, the [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], replacing [[Morgan Schneiderlin]] for the last eight minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France 2–0 Denmark: Lacazette and Giroud on target|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/france-vs-denmark/1703395/report?ICID=MP_MS_5|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Goal.com|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his injury for Chelsea in February, Zouma missed France's hosting of [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref name=injury/&gt;

He returned to the squad in August 2017, replacing the injured [[Raphaël Varane]] for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualifier]] against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-uefa/story/3190974/stoke-defender-kurt-zouma-replaces-raphael-varane-in-france-squad |title=Stoke defender Kurt Zouma replaces Raphael Varane in France squad |date=28 August 2017 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put on standby for France's squad at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Michael|title=World Cup 2018: Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City stars included in France's squad for finals|url=https://talksport.com/football/world-cup-2018-chelsea-manchester-united-and-manchester-city-stars-included-frances-squad|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=Talksport|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma earned his first France cap in over three years on 11 October 2018 as a substitute in a 2–2 friendly draw with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], coming on as a substitute and winning the equalising penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pringle |first1=Ben |title=Chelsea player ratings – International break: Morata and Giroud flop again, Ampadu injured |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1030543/Chelsea-player-ratings-international-break-Morata-Giroud-Ampadu |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Daily Express |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Kurt Zouma (03-08-2011).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zouma with Saint-Étienne in 2011]]
A November 2013 report by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' noted Zouma's strength, reading of the game, and aerial presence, while mentioning his occasional lapses in concentration.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Tim|title=Everything you need to know about... Kurt Zouma|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/everything-you-need-know-about-kurt-zouma#:LTIsiA1MqkpNyA|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=FourFourTwo|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Zouma was named by British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. The newspaper wrote, "Blessed with exceptional power and technique, Zouma is also coveted by many for his leadership qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/19/next-10-big-things-europes-top-youngsters|title=The next 10 big things: Europe's top youngsters and stars of the future|date=18 January 2014|work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Match of the Day]]'' pundit, [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] linked Zouma to [[Marcel Desailly]], another Frenchman who played in defence for Chelsea. Writing after a draw with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], which included a strong run and perfectly-executed sliding tackle on [[Sergio Agüero]], Murphy noted Zouma's reliability and confidence against the strong opponent, in addition to his pace. He predicted that Zouma could be a Chelsea mainstay for years to come, and would be an ideal replacement for captain [[John Terry]], then aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Danny|title=Chelsea 1–1 Man City: 'Kurt Zouma reminds me of Marcel Desailly'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31078757|accessdate=1 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawcross called Zouma the "ultimate defender" for his speed, jump, passing, shooting and tackling, and said that [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Toby Alderweireld]] was the only central defender on his level.&lt;ref name=shawcross/&gt;

==Personal life==
Zouma's parents emigrated to France from the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France: Kurt Zouma parle de la paix en Centrafrique|trans-title=France: Kurt Zouma speaks of peace in the Central African Republic|url=http://www.journaldebangui.com/article.php?aid=7416|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=Journal de Bangui|date=8 October 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother [[Lionel Zouma|Lionel]] plays in the same position for French club [[Football Bourg-en-Bresse Péronnas 01|Bourg-en Bresse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les retrouvailles des " jumeaux " Zouma|trans-title=The reunion of the Zouma "twins"|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/sports/les-retrouvailles-des-jumeaux-zouma-23-03-2014-3697943.php|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=23 March 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is named after Kurt Sloane, [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]'s character in the 1989 film [[Kickboxer (1989 film)|''Kickboxer'']], while his middle name Happy reflects an African tradition of using positive words as middle names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Menezes|first1=Jack|title=Chelsea vs Aston Villa: Kurt Zouma reveals he is named after Jean-Claude Van Damme...and why he has reason to smile all the time|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-vs-aston-villa-kurt-zouma-reveals-he-is-named-after-jean-claude-van-dammeand-why-he-has-9755954.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=The Independent|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is married to Sandra, with whom he has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo: Chelsea star relaxes with his kids at Stamford Bridge|url=http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/12/photo-chelsea-star-relaxes-with-his-kids-at-stamford-bridge/|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=The Sports Review|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea star Kurt Zouma takes his family to Disneyland Paris|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2794277/chelsea-star-kurt-zouma-takes-his-family-to-disneyland-paris|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=[[ESPN]] Soccer |author=Liam Twomey|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka is also the captain of Everton.

Jagielka started his career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 2000, where he played mainly as a [[central midfielder]]. He helped them achieve top-flight status for the [[2006–07 Sheffield United F.C. season|2006–07 season]], after which he joined Everton for a £4&amp;nbsp;million fee.

He has received 40 England caps since his debut in 2008 and was included in the England squads at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Jagielka was born in [[Manchester]]&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and attended [[Knutsford Academy]]. He played for Holy Family Football Club, a Sunday team affiliated with, although not directly linked to, the school of the same name, from the ages of eight to 11. He played as a right winger, as he possessed great pace, and even played in matches against boys of the school year older than him. However, he first impressed youth scouts whilst playing for his local team [[Hale Barns]] United in [[Altrincham]]. He predominantly played midfield during his time with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1132676/From-time-keeper-England-centre-half--rise-rise-Phil-Jagielka.html|title=From time keeper England centre half rise rise PhilJagielka|accessdate=20 March 2009 | location=London | newspaper=Daily Mail | first=Matt | last=Lawton | date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}} He also played for his school team, Moorlands Junior School, playing any position including in goal and with boys 2 school years above him.&lt;ref&gt;Moorlands Junior School&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the academy of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a youngster and spent time training with clubs such as [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1998 at 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shail|first=Mark|title=Jagielka has got his sights set on the Premiership|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/championship/jagielka-has-got-his-sights-set-on-the-premiership|publisher=givemefootball.com|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=17 November 2005}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Sheffield United===
Jagielka made his way through the youth ranks at Sheffield United before making his first-team debut on 5 May 2000 against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the final [[Football League First Division|First Division]] match of the [[1999–2000 Sheffield United F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], whilst still a trainee. He was rewarded with a professional contract the following day and having progressed well at the start of the following season, he signed a three-year deal with the club in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warnock hails teenage ace |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/1108377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 January 2001 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He established himself in the Sheffield United first-team in the [[2002–03 Sheffield United F.C. season|2002–03 season]] and started to attract the attention of other clubs, including [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], who were linked with a £6&amp;nbsp;million joint bid for Jagielka and United teammate [[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]], but Sheffield United said they would resist any attempts to sign the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades deny Leeds approach |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/3153119.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2003 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka stated in April 2005 he was happy to stay at United, despite several [[Premier League]] clubs being interested in signing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jagielka wants to stay at Blades |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4432967.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; United manager [[Neil Warnock]] told [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in June 2005 that Jagielka would not be sold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades warn Hammers off Jagielka |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4115204.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] made a £4&amp;nbsp;million bid for Jagielka, after which United upped their valuation of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewell unhappy over Jagielka bid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4724037.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November, Jagielka had been linked with a £4&amp;nbsp;million move to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], but United manager Neil Warnock said there had been no contact from Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fudge|first1=Simon|title=Blades deny fresh Jags links|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11672/2353563/blades-deny-fresh-jags-links|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka signed a new three-year deal with United in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jagielka commits future to Blades |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/5266726.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played as team captain in [[Chris Morgan (footballer)|Chris Morgan]]'s absence. Jagielka gave United their first Premier League victory since April 1994 when he hit a 91st minute half-volley against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for a 2–1 win in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheff Utd 2–1 Middlesbrough |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/5373476.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |first=Sophie |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being recognised as one of United's key players, chairman [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] admitted that Jagielka could be sold if the price was high enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades may sell Jagielka |url=http://www.football.co.uk/sheffield_united/blades_may_sell_jagielka_238477.shtml |publisher=Football.co.uk |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a home match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 30 December 2006, due to a thigh injury to starting goalkeeper [[Paddy Kenny]] and with his team 1–0 up, Jagielka was forced to play in goal for the remainder of the match. Arsenal were kept at bay for the remaining 34 minutes and Jagielka's late save from [[Robin van Persie]] secured the 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheff Utd 1–0 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6205685.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 December 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to deputise in goal meant that Neil Warnock was able to – and usually did – do without a substitute goalkeeper on the bench in order to give himself more tactical options (League rules then limited the number of substitutes to 5).

By the end of the [[2006–07 Sheffield United F.C. season|2006–07 season]], he had made 133 consecutive league appearances for United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The lowdown – Everton v Wigan|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/the-lowdown-everton-v-wigan.html|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=22 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930022736/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/the-lowdown-everton-v-wigan.html|archivedate=30 September 2012|date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; including every league match in the [[2004–05 Sheffield United F.C. season|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 Sheffield United F.C. season|2005–06]] seasons and every minute of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name=guardian070512/&gt; When Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2006–07 season, Jagielka was linked with moves away from United and goalkeeper Paddy Kenny said he believed it was time Jagielka moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenny feels Jagielka should leave |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/6709039.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; New United boss [[Bryan Robson]] urged Jagielka to wait for the outcome of the club's relegation arbitration hearing before deciding to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades call to Jagielka |url=http://www.football.co.uk/sheffield_united/blades_call_to_jagielka_247725.shtml |publisher=Football.co.uk |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
====2007–2012====
[[File:Phil Jagielka 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Jagielka playing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2011]]

Jagielka eventually signed for Everton on 4 July 2007, in a deal worth £4&amp;nbsp;million on a five-year contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everton secure deal for Jagielka |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/6270146.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest amount ever paid for a Sheffield United player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prentice|first=David|title=Jagielka factfile|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/other-sport/jagielka-factfile-3480991|newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=12 July 2008|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his home debut at [[Goodison Park]] on 31 July 2007 as a second-half substitute in a pre-season friendly against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], replacing [[Joseph Yobo]] in central defence. After a slow start to his Everton career, Jagielka developed into an important member of the first team. He scored his first Everton goal in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] against [[AZ Alkmaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7145803.stm |title=AZ Alkmaar 2–3 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |first=Caroline |last=Cheese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored an own goal against Wigan Athletic, although Everton won 2–1. He put in a succession of man of the match performances in the following matches, against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[SK Brann|Brann]] and Manchester City. He scored his first league goal for Everton against Reading on 9 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7223966.stm |title=Everton 1–0 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |first=Ian |last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka started the 2008–09 season as first-choice centre back, playing every minute of every league match until being injured in a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester City. He was named the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for February&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite web |title=Phil Jagielka: Overview |url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/3222/Phil-Jagielka/overview |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won Everton's fans and club player of the season.&lt;ref name=evertonawards&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards Winners|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/awards-winners|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka scored the winning penalty for Everton in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], but he was claimed to have fouled [[Danny Welbeck]] after 68 minutes, with many claiming it to be a penalty, which the referee did not award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/7990227.stm|title=Man Utd 0–0 Everton (aet) |date=19 January 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he ruptured his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] playing against Manchester City, and as a consequence missed the [[2009 FA Cup Final]], which Everton lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

After missing the end of the 2008–09 season and more than half of 2009–10, Jagielka played his first senior fixture since the cruciate ligament injury in an away match against [[Sporting CP]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in February 2010, coming on as a substitute for an injured [[Philippe Senderos]].

====2013–present====
[[File:Phil Jagielka 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Jagielka playing for Everton in 2014]]

On 3 January 2013, Jagielka signed a new contract at Everton, keeping him at Goodison Park until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England defender Phil Jagielka signs new long-term Everton contract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/03/everton-phil-jagielka-new-contract|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, manager [[David Moyes]] announced that Jagielka would be appointed as the club captain for the [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14 season]] after the retirement of [[Phil Neville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phil Jagielka to succeed departing Phil Neville as Everton captain|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/8633931/phil-jagielka-to-succeed-departing-phil-neville-as-everton-captain|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moyes left for Manchester United, new manager [[Roberto Martínez]] stated that Jagielka would make a "phenomenal captain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.football365.com/everton/8778099/Premier-League-Everton-boss-Roberto-Martinez-backs-Phil-Jagielka-as-captain | title=Martinez: Jagielka suits role | publisher=Football365.com | accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jagielka's first season as captain, Everton amassed a Premier League club record 72 points to finish fifth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/phil-jagielka-everton-even-stronger-7162257 |title=Phil Jagielka: Everton will be even stronger next season under Roberto Martínez |newspaper=North Wales Daily Post |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with him being awarded three accolades at the club: Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season and Goal of the Season.&lt;ref name=evertonprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Phil Jagielka|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/players/p/pj/phil-jagielka|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2014, Jagielka scored his first goal in two seasons with a 30-yard half volley against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Merseyside derby]] to level the match in the 91st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/349943.html |title=Jagielka stunner steals a point after pulsating derby |publisher=ESPN |date=27 September 2014 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2014, Jagielka scored his first European goal in seven years in Everton's 3–0 UEFA Europa League group stage win against [[Lille OSC|Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Andy|title=Leon Osman marks new deal with a goal as Everton cruise to win over Lille|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/06/everton-lille-europa-league-match-report|accessdate=6 November 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka reclaimed his place as Everton's starting centre back in March 2017 after [[Ramiro Funes Mori]] suffered a knee injury on international duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2016–17 Everton Player Reviews: Phil Jagielka |url=https://royalbluemersey.sbnation.com/2017/6/7/15745936/phil-jagielka-season-review-everton-ronald-koeman-ashley-williams-ramiro-funes-mori |publisher=Royal Blue Mersey |date=7 June 2017 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Jagielka scored in three successive league matches for Everton: first, in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] on 4 April – his first league goal in two years – then in a 4–2 victory against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at Goodison Park on 9 April, and finally, in a 3–1 home victory over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 15 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39414200|title=Manchester United 1–1 Everton |date=4 April 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Hafez |first=Shamoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39470449|title=Everton 4–2 Leicester City |date=9 April 2017 |accessdate=9 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Henson |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39536681|title=Everton 3–1 Burnley |date=15 April 2017 |accessdate=15 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Whalley |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Jagielka is a former member of the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] team, and scored in a 2–0 victory over [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England U21s keep hopes alive|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/england/2976038.stm|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2007, Jagielka was named in the [[England national football B team|England B team]] for the first time, for their match against [[Albania national football team|Albania]]. Starting on the bench, he replaced Phil Neville at right back at the beginning of the second half. On 11 May 2008, Jagielka was named in the [[England national football team|senior England squad]] for the first time for the friendlies with [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7395247.stm |title=Hart &amp; Jagielka in England squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently expressed his delight at the call up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2008/05/13/jags-england-delight |title=Jags' England Delight |publisher=Everton F.C. |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly thanked everyone at Everton for their help. On 1 June 2008, Jagielka got his first international cap for the senior team against Trinidad and Tobago, playing the second half of a match in which England used two different sides for each half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trinidad &amp; Tobago 0–3 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7425208.stm|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka was once again named in the England squad for the friendly match against European champions Spain, 11 February 2009, and subsequently played for the first 45 minutes, after an impressive string of performances at club level publicly praised by manager David Moyes after the FA Cup fourth round replay tie between Everton and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_4898063,00.html|title=David Moyes has praised Phil Jagielka after his performance in the FA Cup win over Liverpool|author=Bailey, Richard|date=5 February 2009|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka received his fourth cap when he played in England's first post 2010 FIFA World Cup friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 11 August 2010 at Wembley Stadium where he scored an own goal to put the visitors ahead in a 2–1 England win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerrard brace saves England from embarrassment |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/38775.html |publisher=ESPN |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2010, Jagielka made his first competitive start, and played for the entirety of the match in a 4–0 win over Bulgaria. He was said to have "read the game brilliantly on a night when he proved his credentials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Daily-Mirror-player-ratings-England-4-0-Bulgaria-Joe-Hart-Phil-Jagielka-and-James-Milner-shine-but-Jermaine-Defoe-takes-Man-of-the-Match-award-article571573.html|title=Daily Mirror player ratings: England 4–0 Bulgaria|date=3 September 2010|newspaper=Daily Mirror|location=London|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up to the England squad once again for the Euro 2012 qualifier against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9056797.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=Capello calls up striker Davies | date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up again for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier and friendly against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] on 26 March and came on in the 88th minute for [[Scott Parker]]. On 12 November, he started as centre-half in a friendly against Spain and gave an exceptional performance as England ground their way to a 1–0 win.

Jagielka was originally placed on the standby list for England's [[UEFA Euro 2012]] squad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18081125 | title=England Euro 2012 squad: Ruddy, Carroll &amp; Defoe in, Ferdinand out |publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 May 2012 | accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played the full match in a pre-tournament warm-up match against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], which England won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18184726 | title=Norway 0–1 England |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 28 May 2012, Jagielka was added to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 squads#England|main squad]] after [[Gareth Barry]] was ruled out of the tournament with an abdominal injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18232535 | title=Euro 2012: England confirm squad numbers |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka did not feature in any of England's four matches during the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/teams/team=39/index.html | title=England Squad | publisher=UEFA | accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Jagielka scored his first goal for England, a diving header during a 2–1 friendly victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="England 2–1 Italy"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19238374 |title=England 2–1 Italy |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2014, Jagielka was named in England's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/12/england-world-cup-squad-hodgson-barkley-sterling |title=England World Cup squad 2014: Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling called up |date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second England goal on 30 May 2014 to wrap up a 3–0 friendly win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] at Wembley, reacting after goalkeeper [[Raúl Fernández (footballer)|Raúl Fernández]] dropped a corner from Jagielka's Everton teammate [[Leighton Baines]].&lt;ref name="England 3–0 Peru"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 3–0 Peru |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27383301 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; England were unbeaten in 11 competitive matches in which Jagielka has played in (won eight and drawn three), until they lost 2–1 to Italy in their opening match of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2624125/Phil-Jagielka-England-World-Cup-profile.html |title=Phil Jagielka – England World Cup profile |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285071 |title=England 1–2 Italy |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=14 June 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka scored his third England goal, and first in a competitive fixture, on 9 October 2014; his header opened a 5–0 Wembley win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group E|UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref name="England 5–0 San Marino"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29454223 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka became the first Everton player to captain England when they played against Lithuania on 12 October 2015 in a UEFA Euro qualifying match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-england-captaincy-short-story-10242155|title=Everton and the England captaincy: A short story|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|first=David|last=Prentice|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2016, he became the most capped Everton player by England when he came on as a second-half substitute against Spain in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beesley|first=Chris|title=Everton captain Jagielka breaks Alan Ball's record|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-captain-jagielka-breaks-alan-12182878|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Benfica===
Born in [[Grijó (Vila Nova de Gaia)|Grijó]], [[Vila Nova de Gaia]], [[Porto District]], Gomes joined [[S.L. Benfica]]'s youth system at the age of 18, playing his last year as a junior with the [[Lisbon]] club. On 28 July 2012 he appeared in his first game with the first team, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/emdirecto/1a-liga/interior/em-diretonova-chapa-cinco-2692004.html|title=Nova chapa cinco|trans-title=Another fiver|newspaper=[[O Jogo]]|language=pt|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent [[2012–13 Segunda Liga|his first season]] as a senior with [[S.L. Benfica B|the reserve side]], competing in the [[Segunda Liga|second division]].

Gomes scored his first goals with Benfica B in league matches against [[S.C. Braga B|Braga B]] (2–2 home draw)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/2--liga/detalhe/benfica-b-sp-braga-b-2-2-andre-gomes-da-empate-nos-descontos-772861.html|title=Benfica B-Sp.

Braga B, 2–2: André Gomes for the draw in injury time|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] (6–0, also at home).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/2--liga/detalhe/benfica-b-belenenses-goleada-na-luz-6-0-775375.html|title=Benfica B-Belenenses: Goleada na Luz (6–0)|trans-title=Benfica B-Belenenses: Routing at the Luz (6–0)|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2012, he made his official debut with the main squad, playing 25 minutes after coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Eduardo Salvio]] and netting in a [[2012–13 Taça de Portugal|4–0 win]] at [[S.C. Freamunde|Freamunde]], for the [[Taça de Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portugoal.net/index.php/more-benfica-news/37338-taca-benfica-cruise-past-freamunde |title=Taça: Benfica cruise past Freamunde|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=18 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015706/http://portugoal.net/index.php/more-benfica-news/37338-taca-benfica-cruise-past-freamunde|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes' momentum in Benfica's first team continued on 27 October 2012, as he started and scored in a 3–0 away win over Gil Vicente in his first [[Primeira Liga]] appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-benfica-news/37563-new-look-benfica-return-to-table-top|title=New-look Benfica return to table top|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=28 October 2012|accessdate=28 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222013703/http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-benfica-news/37563-new-look-benfica-return-to-table-top|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, however, to be mainly associated with the B-team.

On 31 January 2014, Benfica (and [[Benfica Stars Fund]]) sold 100% of Gomes' economic rights to a private company, Meriton Capital Limited, for €15&amp;nbsp;million, plus 25% of a future transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/fsd29830.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=[[Portuguese Securities Market Commission]]|language=pt|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at the [[Estádio da Luz]] until the end of [[2013–14 S.L. Benfica season|the campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccernews.com/benfica-cash-rodrigo-andre-gomes/137317/|title=Benfica cash in on Rodrigo, Andre Gomes|publisher=Soccer News|last=Lazarevic|first=Nemanja|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/peter-lim-benfica-andre-gomes-rodrigo/52ec4a94e4b0cbb7a075f5d0.html|title=Peter Lim, o homem que comprou os passes de Rodrigo e André Gomes|trans-title=Peter Lim, the men who bought the rights for Rodrigo and André Gomes|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2014, Gomes played the full 90 minutes in the second leg of the semi-finals of the [[2013–14 Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]], scoring the final 3–1 after a brilliant individual effort to help his team – who played with one man less for 60 minutes against [[FC Porto|Porto]] – win the tie 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2606506/Benfica-3-1-Porto-agg-3-2-Match-report-Andre-Gomes-books-Eagles-Portuguese-Cup-final-place-Jorge-Jesus-Ricardo-Quaresma-red-fans-invade-pitch-stormy-clash.html|title=Benfica 3–1 Porto (agg 3–2): Andre Gomes books Eagles' Portuguese Cup final place as Jorge Jesus and Ricardo Quaresma see red and fans invade pitch in stormy clash|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Homewood|first=Brian|date=16 April 2014|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2014/04/17/futbol/futbol_internacional/1397687122.html|title=El Benfica remonta y pasa a la final de Copa|trans-title=Benfica come back from behind and reach Cup final|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=es|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended [[2013–14 Primeira Liga|the season]] with 23 games all competitions comprised, helping the club win the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in its history (league, cup and [[2013–14 Taça da Liga|Taça da Liga]]).

===Valencia===
On 17 July 2014, Gomes agreed to a one-season loan deal with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valenciacf.com/ver/36381/comunicado-oficial-del-valencia-cf.html|title=Comunicado oficial|trans-title=Official announcement|publisher=Valencia CF|language=es|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Internacional/espanha/interior.aspx?content_id=895137|title=Valencia regista André Gomes como emprestado pelo Benfica|trans-title=Valencia register André Gomes as loaned by Benfica|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720002942/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Internacional/espanha/interior.aspx?content_id=895137|archivedate=20 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining a host of compatriots including manager [[Nuno Espírito Santo]]. Although his economic rights were owned by [[Peter Lim]], a loan deal was arranged to take him and [[Rodrigo (footballer, born 1991)|Rodrigo]] to the Spanish club due to Lim's purchase of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rr.sapo.pt/bolabranca_detalhe.aspx?fid=47&amp;did=155784|title=Valência procura "forma jurídica" para levar Rodrigo e André Gomes|trans-title=Valencia look for "legal way" to take Rodrigo and André Gomes|publisher=[[Rádio Renascença]]|language=pt|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes made his [[La Liga]] debut on 23 August 2014, starting in a 1–1 away draw against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2014_15/primera/jornada_1/sev_val/|title=Punto de fe del Valencia|trans-title=Valencia point of faith|newspaper=Marca|last=Campos|first=Tomás|location=Madrid|language=es|date=23 August 2014|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in the competition on 22 September, netting the second of a 3–0 away win over [[Getafe CF|Getafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2014_15/primera/jornada_4/get_val/|title=El naranja pinta muy bien|trans-title=Orange is such a great colour|newspaper=Marca|last=Melero|first=Delfín|location=Madrid|language=es|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, Benfica and Valencia announced they had reached an agreement on Gomes' federative rights. Subsequently, he signed a contract with the Spaniards until 30 June 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi/emitentes/docs/FR56142.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=Portuguese Securities Market Commission|language=pt|date=12 June 2015|access-date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.valenciacf.com/ver/41501/comunicado-oficial---andre-gomes.html|title=André Gomes joins Valencia CF on a permanent deal through to 2020|publisher=Valencia CF|date=12 June 2015|access-date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1899 Hoffenheim===

During the first half of the [[2011–12 Bundesliga|2011–12 season]], Gylfi fell out of favour with the club's new manager, making just seven league appearances and was linked with a move away from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/swansea-agree-68m-fee-with-hoffenheim-for-gylfi-sigurdsson-7793540.html |title=Swansea agree £6.8m fee with Hoffenheim for Gylfi Sigurdsson |work=The Independent |first=Carl |last=Markham |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May, Swansea agreed a £6.8&amp;nbsp;million fee with 1899 Hoffenheim for the permanent transfer of Gylfi, subject to him passing a medical.

[[Brian McDermott (footballer)|Brian McDermott]] confirmed Reading made three unsuccessful bids to bring Gylfi back to his former club during the [[List of English football transfers winter 2012–13|January 2013 transfer window]], including a club record offer on deadline day thought by [[BBC Sport]] to be around £10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21291221 |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson: Reading failed with bid for Tottenham player |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, Gylfi scored his first Premier League goal for Tottenham, the second goal in a 3–2 win against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].

===Return to Swansea City===
In July 2014, Tottenham announced a deal had been reached with Swansea City for Gylfi to re-join his former club, with Swansea left-back [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1993)|Ben Davies]] joining Spurs.

Gylfi took part in the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification|2008 U19 European Championship qualifying]], scoring twice in qualification and twice in the elite round, but Iceland lost out to group winners [[Bulgaria national under-19 football team|Bulgaria]] by three points and missed out on the finals. In November 2007, Gylfi made his [[Iceland national under-21 football team|under-21]] debut for Iceland, playing 30 minutes against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] in a 3–0 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/players/player=102293/profile/index.html |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson |publisher=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 7|2009 European Under-21 Championship qualifying]] four days later, coming as an extra-time substitute, and played in the remaining matches.

'''Theo James Walcott''' (born 16 March 1989) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Everton}} club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Walcott is a product of the [[Southampton F.C. Academy|Southampton Academy]] and started his career with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] before joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for £5&amp;nbsp;million in 2006. His speedy pace and ball crossing led his manager [[Arsène Wenger]] to deploy him on the [[Forward (association football)#Winger|wing]] for most of his career. Walcott has been played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] since the [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13 season]] when he was Arsenal's top scorer,&lt;ref name="Reading 301012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kickoff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=1&amp;season=2012&amp;area=squad|title=Arsenal Statistics 2012/13|publisher=KickOff.co.uk|access-date=30 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101190400/http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=1&amp;season=2012&amp;area=squad|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has scored more than 100 goals for the club.&lt;ref name=AFCProfile/&gt;

On 30 May 2006, Walcott became England's youngest ever senior football player aged 17 years and 75 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson|first=Steve|title=The kids are alright: Football's youngest ever |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3115222/The-kids-are-alright-Footballs-youngest-ever.html#|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=16 June 2012|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he received the [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name=BBCAward/&gt; On 6 September 2008, he made his first competitive start in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], and in the following match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a [[hat-trick]] for England. He has represented England at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] and has 47 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s, scoring eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theo Walcott|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/W/Theo-Walcott |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Walcott was born to a black [[British Jamaican]] father and a white English mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Don Walcott, father of Theo, is the British-born son of Jamaican parents |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London | url= http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/64555| date = 4 October 2008|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up as a [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fan due to his father's support of Liverpool. When Chelsea asked him to be a ball boy, he used the opportunity to meet his Liverpool idols:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was playing in a tournament for Swindon when Southampton and Chelsea showed an interest. Chelsea invited me to be a [[ball boy|ball-boy]] for a match against Liverpool and it was fantastic to meet my heroes [[Michael Owen]] and [[Robbie Fowler]]. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them. Unfortunately I wasn't born when the team had their golden era, but I enjoyed watching the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and [[Steve McManaman]] when I was growing up. When Liverpool won the Champions League last year,&lt;ref&gt;2005&lt;/ref&gt; I went mad. I was shouting so loud I think I woke up the entire village where I live!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/theo-walcott-why-i-m-a-liverpool-fan |date=20 June 2006 |title=Theo Walcott: Why I'm a Liverpool fan |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225104416/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/theo-walcott-why-i-m-a-liverpool-fan |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He attended Compton Church of England Primary School and [[The Downs School, Compton|The Downs School]], playing football for the local village team and later for [[A.F.C. Newbury|Newbury]]. Walcott scored more than 100 goals in his one and only season for Newbury, before leaving there for [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=9 May 2006 | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/topstories/tm_objectid=17050876&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=theo-lions-on-his-shirt--name_page.html |first=Martin |last=Fricker |author2=Robert Stansfield  | title=Theo Lions on His Shirt | newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London| accessdate=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent only six months there before leaving for Southampton after he rejected a chance to join [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article4004073.ece |title=Theo Walcott sees action on two fronts in his national service |newspaper=The Times |location=London |author=Lansley, Peter |date=26 May 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] agreed to a sponsorship deal with Walcott when he was fourteen years old.&lt;ref name=WG&gt;{{cite news | date=10 January 2006| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1682874,00.html | title=Walcott spoilt for choice as Saints do their sums | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=7 July 2006 | location=London | first=Jeremy | last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
In the [[2004–05 Southampton F.C. season|2004–05]] season, Walcott starred in the Southampton youth team that reached the final of the [[FA Youth Cup Final Squads#2004/05: Ipswich Town v. Southampton (1-0, 2-2)|FA Youth Cup]] against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref name=FAYouthCup&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5551534.FA_YOUTH_CUP__SAINTS_2___IPSWICH_2/ |title=FA Youth Cup: Saints 2 – Ipswich 2 |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=19 April 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5551226.FA_YOUTH_CUP_FINAL__IPSWICH_1___SAINTS_0/ |title=FA Youth Cup Final: Ipswich 1 – Saints 0 |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=23 April 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he became the youngest person to play in the Southampton reserve team, at 15 years and 175 days, when he came off the bench against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/?page_id=3483 |title=Record breaker! |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014111113/http://saintsfc.co.uk/?page_id=3483 |archivedate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not play in the Premier League, and Southampton were relegated to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] at the end of the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref name=WG/&gt;

Before the start of the [[2005–06 Southampton F.C. season|2005–06]] season, Walcott linked up with the first-team's tour of Scotland, just two weeks after leaving school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5635618.Theo__16__can_break_Danny_s_Saints_record/ |title=Theo, 16, can break Danny's Saints record |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=18 July 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the youngest-ever player with the Southampton first team, at 16 years and 143 days, after coming on as a substitute in Southampton's 0–0 draw at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5636530.Brilliant/ |title=Brilliant |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott made his full first-team debut away to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 18 October 2005, and became Southampton's youngest senior goalscorer after 25 minutes of the 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5638766.Walcott_stars_but_there_s_no_easy_solution_to_Saints__woes/ |title=Walcott stars but there's no easy solution to Saints' woes |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=19 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again away at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] four days later, and yet again in his full home debut against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the following Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/oct/23/match.sport7 |title=Walcott eclipses Wise |first=Anna |last=Kessel |website=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4366862.stm |title=Southampton 2–0 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rapid rise to fame also led him to be named amongst the top three finalists for the prestigious [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]] award on 11 December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/academy/4499096.stm |title=Three stars up for BBC award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott's [[2009–10 Arsenal F.C. season|2009–10 season]] was marred by injury: he made only 15 starts in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2063032,00.html |title=Walcott axed from England squad |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226185633/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2063032,00.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with lower back, knee and hamstring meant he did not play a full 90 minutes until 9 December, against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in the Champions League, as Arsenal, already qualified for the knockout stages, fielded the youngest team ever to start a match in that competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/11/theo-walcott-arsenal-carlos-vela |title=Theo Walcott claims he is not an injury-prone player, just unlucky |first=David |last=Hytner |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0910/post/first-team/olympiacos-1-0-arsenal-match-report |title=Olympiacos 1–0 Arsenal |first=Richard |last=Clarke |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2010, Walcott scored his second goal of the season against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a 3–1 victory to give Arsenal a decisive lead, with a left-footed effort from the edge of the box, after cutting inside from the right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/08/arsenal-burnley-premier-league |title=Arsenal's Theo Walcott answers critics with display of brainpower |first=David |last=Hytner |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first hour of the Champions League quarter-final first leg, Arsenal were outclassed by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], although only two goals behind. Walcott's appearance off the bench was the turning point.

====2016–17 season====
Walcott started Arsenal's opening match against Liverpool, in which he missed a penalty after being brought down by [[Alberto Moreno]], however, he made-up for his earlier miss by scoring Arsenal's opener, however Arsenal still lost the match 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37001073|first= Saj |last=Chowdhury |title=Arsenal 3–4 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 August 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walcott scored his second goal of the season and his 100th career goal after linking up with [[Alex Iwobi]] to chip the ball over Hull City goalkeeper [[Eldin Jakupović]] to score Arsenal's second goal in a 4–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh| last=James| url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1617/post/first-team/hull-city-v-arsenal-report |title=Hull City 1–4 Arsenal |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=17 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abraham |first=Timothy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37326798 |title=Hull City 1–4 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then netted his first [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] goals of the season with a brace in a 2–0 win over [[FC Basel|Basel]] on 30 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/arsenal-basel-champions-league-match-report|title=Theo Walcott at the double in comfortable Arsenal win against Basel|last=Fifield|first=Dominic|date=28 September 2016|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
With the scores tied at 1–1 after normal time, Walcott converted his kick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 4–1 on penalties to win the [[2017 FA Community Shield|2017 Community Shield]],&lt;ref name=2017CS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40766983 |title=Arsenal 1–1 Chelsea |first=Tom |last=Rostance |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but throughout his last season at Arsenal, he was mainly used in the [[Europa League]] and in the [[EFL Cup]], and he only made 6 substitute appearances in the Premier League. By October, he was increasingly on the fringes at Arsenal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/20/theo-walcott-confident-can-work-way-back-englands-world-cupteam/ |title=Theo Walcott confident he can work way back into England's World Cup team |first=Sam |last=Dean |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=20 October 2017 |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WrightLeave/&gt; and was criticised following a poor performance when made captain in a 2–1 League Cup victory at home to Championship side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/arsenal/359/blog/post/3242666/supersub-eddie-nketiah-starsjack-wilshere-gets-7-10-as-arsenal-avoid-norwich-slip |title=Eddie Nketiah stars, Jack Wilshere gets 7/10 as Arsenal avoid Norwich slip |first=James |last=McNicholas |publisher=ESPN |date=24 October 2017 |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Arsenal's second highest goalscorer [[Ian Wright]] suggesting that for Walcott's own good, he needed to leave the club,&lt;ref name=WrightLeave&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11097474/theo-walcott-should-leave-arsenal-says-ian-wright-on-the-debate |title=Theo Walcott should leave Arsenal, says Ian Wright on The Debate |publisher=Sky Sports |date=25 October 2017 |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view with which Wenger disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11099424/theo-walcott-still-wanted-at-arsenal-says-arsene-wenger |title=Theo Walcott still wanted at Arsenal, says Arsene Wenger |first=James |last=Dale |publisher=Sky Sports |date=26 October 2017 |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walcott did score 4 goals during his last season at the club, against [[Doncaster Rovers]] in the League Cup &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249728|title=Arsenal 1–0 Doncaster Rovers|date=20 September 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 3 in the [[2017–18_UEFA_Europa_League_group_stage#Group_H|Europa League group stage]], all coming against [[BATE Borisov]], with 2 away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2018/matches/round=2000890/match=2022053/index.html#/|title=UEFA Europa League – BATE-Arsenal|first=|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 1 at home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2018/matches/round=2000890/match=2022149/index.html#/|title=UEFA Europa League – Arsenal-BATE|first=|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Everton===
On 17 January 2018, Walcott signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Everton in what the BBC reported as "a deal worth more than £20m".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42715223 |title=Theo Walcott: Everton sign forward from Arsenal |first=David |last=Ornstein |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club three days later, providing the assist for [[Oumar Niasse]]'s equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home to West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/everton-west-brom-premier-league-report |title=Oumar Niasse's volley earns draw for listless Everton against West Brom |first=Nick |last=Ames |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=20 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then recorded a [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in his next match, a 2–1 win over Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theo Walcott ends Everton's winless run with double against Leicester |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/31/everton-leicester-premier-league-match-report |accessdate=2 February 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===2006 World Cup===
On 8 May 2006, Walcott was surprisingly named in [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads#England|squad]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4983618.stm|title=Walcott &amp; Lennon in England squad|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=15 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having only made 13 appearances in senior football and making none since joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=walcottlennon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-385548/Theo-Walcott-Ten-things-didnt-know.html|title=Theo Walcott: Ten things you didn't know|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=15 August 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with first-choice strikers [[Wayne Rooney]] and Michael Owen both recovering from injury, Walcott was selected over established Premier League strikers [[Darren Bent]] (the highest-scoring English forward in the Premier League in the [[2005–06 Premier League|2005–06 season]]), [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] (the top English goalscorer in the Premier League in the [[2004–05 Premier League|2004–05 season]]), [[Dean Ashton]] (like Bent, already an established player at [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] level) and [[Jermain Defoe]].&lt;ref name=walcottlennon/&gt;

On 25 May 2006, Walcott came on as a second-half substitute for the [[England national football B team|England B]] team against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5017924.stm |title=England B 1–2 Belarus |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2006, he became [[England national football team records|England's youngest ever senior player]] by appearing in a 3–1 [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] win over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Old Trafford]] aged 17 years and 75 days. Despite being one of only two fully fit strikers in the England squad (the other being [[Peter Crouch]]), he did not play during the tournament. Eriksson defended his decision, claiming that the experience would serve Walcott well for future tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2 July 2006| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5139428.stm | title=Eriksson defends Walcott choice |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=7 July 2006 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the World Cup, Eriksson stepped down as England manager. New appointment [[Steve McClaren]] put Walcott into the England Under-21s, claiming he was "toughening up" on his squad selections.&lt;ref name="Thursday's gossip column"/&gt;

===2007 and 2009 Under-21 European Championships===
On 15 August 2006, Walcott became the youngest player ever to score for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] when he scored the opener after three minutes in England's 2–2 draw with [[Moldova national under-21 football team|Moldova]] at Ipswich Town's ground [[Portman Road]]. The match against Moldova was his first cap for the England under-21s.&lt;ref name="Thursday's gossip column"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/4778613.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=Thursday's gossip column | date=10 August 2006 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott scored two goals against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] to seal qualification for England to the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|Under-21 European Championship]], in the playoff second leg in October 2006, with his second drawing comparisons with Thierry Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,30849-2398754,00.html |date=11 October 2006|title=Wizardry of Walcott puts Germany under a spell |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=8 December 2006 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Lansley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the summer of 2009, Walcott participated in England under-21 team's [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] campaign despite protestations from his club manager, Arsène Wenger. Wenger complained that Walcott's participation in the tournament as well as matches with the senior squad would lead to burn out and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8067214.stm |title=

England reached the final of the U21 Euros, where they lost 4–0 to Germany, with Walcott thus earning a silver medal as a runner-up.&lt;ref name=Euros&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/5690126/England-U21-0-Germany-U21-4-match-report.html |title=England U21 0 Germany U21 4: Match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup Qualification and omission from Finals===
On 6 September 2008, Walcott made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1052695/Capello-wields-axe-Becks-Walcott-set-England-start-Andorra.html|title=Capello wields axe on Becks: Walcott set for England start|newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England. In doing so, Walcott also became the first England player to score a hat-trick in a competitive match since Michael Owen in 2001.&lt;ref name=Croatia&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |title=Croatia 1–4 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7602774.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott returned to the international fold on 3 March 2010 in a friendly against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]]. It was his first international start for nine months.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article7049298.ece |title=Theo Walcott does not understand football, says Chris Waddle |author=Smith, Ben |date=4 March 2010 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=30 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faded after a bright start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/750456/ce/uk/?campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;cc=4716&amp;ver=global |title=Waddle unimpressed with Walcott |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at [[Wembley Stadium]]. His performance came under heavy criticism from [[Chris Waddle]] who said of Walcott, "I've never seen him develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. It's all off the cuff. I just don't think he's got a football brain and he's going to have problems. Let's be honest, good defenders would catch him offside every time."&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

Walcott started England's friendly victories against Mexico and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8699042.stm|title=England 3–1 Mexico|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8712673.stm|title=Japan 1–2 England|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 1 June 2010, it was announced that Walcott had been left out of England's 23-man World Cup squad by [[Fabio Capello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8713742.stm |title=World Cup 2010: Walcott left out of England squad |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July, a few days after England's exit from the World Cup, [[Lionel Messi]] said that he was shocked by Walcott's exclusion as he believed that Walcott could have made the difference against Germany and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/805925/ce/uk/?cc=4716&amp;ver=global |title=World Cup 2010: Messi shocked by Walcott's axe  |date=4 July 2010 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Capello admitted that he had made a mistake in not selecting Walcott for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-should-have-taken-theo-walcott-to-the-world-cup-admits-fabio-capello-vdppp2t65zc|title=I should have taken Theo Walcott to World Cup, admits Fabio Capello|date=28 January 2011|first=Oliver|last=Kay|newspaper= The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euro 2012===
In the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifying]] match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 7 September 2010, Walcott was stretchered off after he was clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= England winger Theo Walcott has X-ray on ankle injury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8978359.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting him out of action for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2148973,00.html |title=Walcott blow for Gunners |date=9 September 2010 |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226184512/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2148973,00.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodgson commented, "Theo unfortunately has not got such a regular match over the last few months and has had a few problems with injury.

==Club career==
===Lille===
[[File:Lucas Digne (LOSC).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Digne playing for [[Lille OSC|Lille]] in 2012]]
Born in [[Meaux]], [[Seine-et-Marne]], Digne finished his development at [[Lille OSC|Lille]], signing his first professional contract on 27 July 2010 for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.losc.fr/filInfo.php?id=2835 |title=Digne et le LOSC liés jusqu'en 2013 |date=27 July 2010 |work=[[Lille OSC]] |accessdate=2 August 2010 |language=French}}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the [[2011–12 Ligue 1|2011–12 season]], Digne was promoted to the senior team permanently and assigned the number 3 shirt. He made his professional debut on 26 October 2011 in a 6–1 victory over [[CS Sedan Ardennes|Sedan]] in the last 16 of the [[Coupe de la Ligue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/75645 |title=Lille v. Sedan Match Report |date=6 October 2011 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |accessdate=26 October 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Digne extended his contract until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lucas Digne prolonge à Lille |trans-title=Lucas Digne prolongs at Lille |url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/football/ligue-1/Homes-Clubs/lille/fil-info/lucas-digne-prolonge-a-lille-527131 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |work=Le Figaro |date=10 January 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January, he made his [[Ligue 1]] debut at the [[Stadium Nord Lille Metropole]], playing the final two minutes of a 3–0 win over [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Les Dogues passent au vert ! |trans-title=The ''Dogues'' go at the green! |url=https://www.losc.fr/actualites-foot-lille/losc-asse-3-0-les-dogues-passent-au-vert |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=Lille OSC |date=28 January 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He totalled 16 league appearances as the defending champions came third.

Digne was a regular in the 2012–13 season. On 23 February 2013, having given Lille the lead in a 3–1 win at [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]] when his cross was deflected in by [[Yoann Poulard]], he was sent off after an hour for a foul on [[Matthieu Chalmé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten-man Lille ease to victory |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/ac-ajaccio-vs-lille/259888 |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on 7 April, a penalty in a 5–0 home win over [[FC Lorient|Lorient]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kalou at the double for Lille |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/lille-vs-lorient/284955 |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two weeks later he added another to equalise in a 2–1 comeback victory at [[SC Bastia|Bastia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lille fight back at Bastia |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/bastia-vs-lille/260036 |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Saint-Germain===
On 17 July 2013, Digne signed a five-year deal with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.psg.fr/en/News/003001/Article/62873/Lucas-Digne-signs-five-year-deal-with-Paris-Saint-Germain |title=LUCAS DIGNE SIGNS FIVE-YEAR DEAL WITH PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013 |publisher=Paris Saint-Germain F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a fee believed to be around €15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/69/transfer-zone/2013/07/17/4124637/paris-saint-germain-seals-digne-deal |title=Paris Saint-Germain seals Digne deal |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013 |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August, he was an unused substitute as they won the [[2013 Trophée des Champions]] with a 2–1 victory over [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paris Saint-Germain 2–1 Girondins de Bordeaux |url=https://www.lfp.fr/tropheeChampions/feuille_match/78274 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=LFP |date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not make his debut until 13 September in a 2–0 win at the same opponents, as manager [[Laurent Blanc]] rotated his squad ahead of the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Digne to get his chance in Bordeaux? |url=https://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/digne-to-get-his-chance-in-bordeaux.htm |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=Ligue 1 |date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Digne et Ongenda titulaires avec le PSG à Bordeaux|trans-title=Digne and Ongenda starters for PSG at Bordeaux |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-sports/ligue-1-digne-et-ongenda-titulaires-avec-le-psg-a-bordeaux-13-09-2013-3134467.php |accessdate=31 July 2018 |work=Le Parisien |date=13 September 2013 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSG ended the season with both the league and league cup titles, though Digne was back-up to Brazilian veteran [[Maxwell (footballer)|Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

Digne played the full 90 minutes in the [[2014 Trophée des Champions]], which PSG won 2–0 against [[EA Guingamp|Guingamp]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maltret |first1=Laurent |title=Paris brille à Pékin |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match/316940 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |work=L'Équipe |date=2 August 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parisians won all four domestic honours in 2014–15, with Digne an unused substitute in their Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue final victories.

====Roma (loan)====
On 26 August 2015, Italian [[Serie A]] club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] signed Digne from PSG on a season-long loan deal for €2.5&amp;nbsp;million, with the option to make the move permanent at the end of the [[2015–16 A.S. Roma season|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asroma.it/en/news/roma_complete_signing_of_lucas_digne |title=Roma complete signing of Lucas Digne |date=26 August 2015 |publisher=[[A.S. Roma]] |accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut five days later, playing the entire match in a 2–1 victory against title holders [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]]. He blew a sarcastic kiss at opponent [[Roberto Pereyra]] and advised him to check the scoreboard, a gesture likened to one by Roma captain [[Francesco Totti]] to [[Igor Tudor]] of the same rival in a 4–0 win in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roma, Digne come Totti: sfottò alla Juve per il risultato |trans-title=Roma, Digne like Totti: teased Juventus for the result |url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2015/08/31/digne-come-totti-sfotto-risultato-roma-juve.html |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2015 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digne scored his first goal for the ''Giallorossi'' on 26 September with a close-range header in a 5–1 home win over [[Carpi F.C. 1909|Carpi]], having earlier assisted [[Kostas Manolas]] in opening his account for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roma 5 Carpi 1: Garcia's five-star men leave new boys winless |url=http://www.beinsports.com/en/football/news/roma-5-carpi-1-garcias-five-star-men-leave-1/103943 |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=beIN Sports |date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the same opponents on 12 February, he returned from injury to score from 30 metres in a 3–1 win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le superbe but de Lucas Digne (AS Roma) face à Carpi|trans-title=Lucas Digne's (AS Roma) superb goal against Carpi |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Le-superbe-but-de-lucas-digne-as-roma-face-a-carpi/634098 |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=L'Équipe |date=12 February 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 April he opened a 3–3 draw at [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=10 facts and figures on Atalanta 3–3 Roma |url=http://www.asroma.com/en/news/2016/4/10-facts-and-figures-on-atalanta-3-3-roma |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=AS Roma |date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team from Italy's [[Rome|capital]] came third in Serie A, and Digne declared that he wanted the move to be made permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rodden |first1=Mark |title=Paris Saint-Germain defender Lucas Digne wants permanent Roma move |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/2874642/paris-saint-germain-defender-lucas-digne-wants-permanent-roma-move |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=ESPN FC |date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona===
On 13 July 2016, Digne joined Spanish [[La Liga]] side [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on a five-year deal. The fee was €16.5&amp;nbsp;million (£13.8&amp;nbsp;million), with the possibility to increase to €20.5&amp;nbsp;million (£17.1&amp;nbsp;million), according to individual and team results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2016-2017/lucas-digne-becomes-fc-barcelona-s-latest-signing |title=Lucas Digne becomes FC Barcelona's latest signing |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2016, Digne made his first appearance for Barcelona in a 0–2 victory against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the [[2016 Supercopa de España]] first leg, as a 27th-minute substitute for compatriot [[Jérémy Mathieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.barcablaugranes.com/2016/8/15/12479424/barcelonas-lucas-digne-impresses-on-debut-vs-sevilla |title=Barcelona's Lucas Digne Impresses on Debut vs. Sevilla |last=Mazariegos |first=Luis |date=2016-08-15 |website=Barca Blaugranes|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played 26 total games in his first season at the [[Camp Nou]], scoring once in a 7–0 (8–1 aggregate) win over [[Segunda División B]] club [[Hércules CF|Hércules]] in the last 32 of the [[Copa del Rey]] on 21 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barcelona 7–0 Hércules |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38339837 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona won that cup, with Digne unused in the [[2017 Copa del Rey Final|final]] on 27 May 2017, a 3–1 win over [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barcelona 3–1 Alaves |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39909498 |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digne played 20 times in [[2017–18 FC Barcelona season|2017–18]] as Barcelona won the league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]] under new manager [[Ernesto Valverde]].

Mina made his [[Categoría Primera A]] debut on 15 September 2013, starting in a 0–0 draw at [[Deportivo Cali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/deportes/deportivo-cali-no-brillo-en-palmaseca-y-empato-con-el-pasto.html |title=Deportivo Cali no brilló en Palmaseca y empató con el Pasto|trans-title=Deportivo Cali did not shine at the Palmaseca and drew with Pasto |publisher=[[El País (Cali)|El País]] |language=es |date=15 September 2013|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first professional goal occurred on 18 October, as he scored his team's first in a 2–2 home draw against [[Atlético Huila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minuto30.com/liga-postobon-pasto-aplazo-su-clasificacion-a-cuadrangulares-empato-ante-huila-en-casa/195265/ |title=Liga Postobón: Pasto aplazó su clasificación a cuadrangulares empató ante Huila en casa|trans-title=Liga Postobón: Pasto delayed his qualification to the quadrangular drawing with Huila at home |publisher=Minuto 30 |language=es |date=19 October 2013|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independiente Santa Fe===
On 14 December 2013, Mina moved to fellow top tier club [[Independiente Santa Fe]], initially on a one-year loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://independientesantafe.co/2013/12/santa-fe-confirma-nuevo-defensa-central-para-2014/ |title=Santa Fe confirma nuevo defensa central para 2014|trans-title=Santa Fe confirm new central defender for 2014 |publisher=Independiente Santa Fe |language=es |date=14 December 2013|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club the following 25 January, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 home win against [[Rionegro F.C.|Rionegro]].

Mina immediately became a regular starter for the side, winning the [[2015 Superliga Colombiana]] by netting the first goal in the 2–0 win against [[Atlético Nacional]] in the second leg of the Finals.

===Palmeiras===
On 1 May 2016, Mina was confirmed as the new player of [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], but only joined the club in the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/2016/05/palmeiras-acerta-contratacao-do-zagueiro-yerry-mina-do-santa-fe.html |title=Palmeiras acerta contratação do zagueiro Yerry Mina, do Santa Fe|trans-title=Palmeiras sign stopper Yerry Mina, from Santa Fe |publisher=[[Globo Esporte]] |language=pt |date=1 May 2016|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a five-year contract with the club eleven days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmeiras.com.br/news/2017/03/07/mina-firma-vinculo-por-cinco-anos-e-se-encanta-com-o-allianz-parque.shtml |title=Mina firma vínculo por cinco anos e se encanta com o Allianz Parque|trans-title=Mina signs five-year link and is delighted with Allianz Parque |publisher=SE Palmeiras |language=pt |date=11 May 2016|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Tosun has said his ability is equal with his left and right foot, as his father Senol forbade him from using his right foot in an attempt to strengthen his left.&lt;ref name=echo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Neil|title=Everton target Cenk Tosun – the two-footed Turk who idolises Gabriel Omar Batistuta and just loves scoring goals|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-target-cenk-tosun-two-14087702|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Liverpool Echo|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he idolised Argentine forward [[Gabriel Batistuta]].&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; While Tosun likens himself to [[Mario Gómez]] and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], ''[[The Times]]'' writer Gary Jacob instead found him more similar to the English strikers [[Kevin Davies]] and [[Andy Carroll]] for his physicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tosun cuts frustrated figure on Everton debut|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tosun-cuts-frustrated-figure-on-everton-debut-59cl23rq7|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Times|date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morgan Fernand Gérard Schneiderlin''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔʁgan ʃnedɛʁlɛ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://forvo.com/word/morgan_schneiderlin/ |title=How to pronounce Morgan Schneiderlin |website=Forvo |accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 8 November 1989) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[defensive midfielder]] for English {{English football updater|Everton}} club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

Schneiderlin began his career with [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], before moving to England to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in June 2008. He made 260 appearances across all competitions in seven seasons at the club, and was in the teams which earned consecutive promotions to reach the Premier League. He joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for a potential £27&amp;nbsp;million fee in July 2015, but left for Everton in January 2017 for a fee of up to £24&amp;nbsp;million.

After representing France at all levels from [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] onwards, Schneiderlin made his senior international debut in 2014. He was included in their squads for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Strasbourg===
Born in [[Obernai]], Alsace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|25256|accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderlin started playing football with his friends at the SR Zellwiller football ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://o-posts.com/news/teams/uk/morgan-schneiderlin-southamptons-tenacious-bull-terrier/ |title=Morgan Schneiderlin: Southampton's Tenacious Bull-Terrier |first=Adam |last=Gray |website=O-Posts |date=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721230538/http://o-posts.com/news/teams/uk/morgan-schneiderlin-southamptons-tenacious-bull-terrier/ |archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but began his career later with the major regional club [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]'s youth ranks in 1995, after members of his family brought him to one of the club's scouting sessions when he was five years old. After 10 years moving through the youth ranks, he signed his first professional contract with the club in 2005 and debuted for the B-team later that year. In 2006, he made his professional debut with the senior side and would go on to make four more appearances for the club, before being sold following the club's relegation during the [[2007–08 Ligue 1]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/morgan-schneiderlin-le-ballon-d-alsace-185454.html |title=Morgan Schneiderlin, le ballon d'Alsace |trans-title=Morgan Schneiderlin, the Alsace Balloon |first=Régis |last=Delanoë |website=SO FOOT.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dna.fr/actualite/2014/06/06/morgan-schneiderlin-rappele |title=Morgan Schneiderlin rappelé! |trans-title=Morgan Schneiderlin recalled! |newspaper=Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace |location=Strasbourg |date=6 June 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/sports/football/football-retour-aux-sources-pour-l-international-alsacien-morgan-schneiderlin-1435084855 |title=Retour aux sources pour l'international alsacien Morgan Schneiderlin |trans-title=Back to the roots for Alsatian international Morgan Schneiderlin |first=Céline |last=Rousseau |publisher=France Bleu |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
Schneiderlin moved from Strasbourg to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 27 June 2008, having signed a four-year contract in a deal that could rise to €1.5&amp;nbsp;million (£1.2&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news |date=27 June 2008 |title=Saints tie up Schneiderlin deal |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/7477504.stm |accessdate=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Southampton despite receiving an offer from [[South Coast derby|local rivals]] [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], then a [[Premier League]] team.&lt;ref name=beeb/&gt; Schneiderlin made his debut in a 2–1 defeat away to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 9 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/7540944.stm |title=Cardiff 2–1 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September, he came off the bench to score his second goal for the club in a 1–1 draw at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He scored a 35-yard effort in a 3–0 victory at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], meaning he had scored more than one goal in a season for the first time at Southampton.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

After promotion to the Premier League, he kept his place in the side, playing the full 90 minutes of the opening game against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

===Manchester United===
[[File:Young, Schneiderlin - July 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Schneiderlin (right) playing for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2015]]
After much speculation during the summer, Schneiderlin signed for Manchester United on 13 July 2015 for a fee in the region of £25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33511027 |title=Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin join Man Utd |date=13 July 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing for United, he said: "I am delighted to be a Manchester United player.

'''Bernard''' (''[[Bernhard]]'') is a [[West Germanic]] masculine given name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Dauzat]], ''Noms et prénoms de France'', Librairie Larousse 1980. p. 38, New completed edition by [[:fr:Marie-Thérèse Morlet|Marie-Thérèse Morlet]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is attested from at least the 9th century. West Germanic ''Bernhard'' is composed from the two elements ''bern'' "bear" and ''hard'' "brave, hardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=bernhard|title=Name Meaning and Origin|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=2013-06-16}}.
T. F. Hoad, ''English Etymology'', Oxford University Press 1993. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Its native Old English reflex was ''Beornheard'', which was replaced by the Old French form ''Bernard'' after the Norman conquest.
The name ''Bernhard'' was notably popular among [[Old Frisian]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/diekosenamender00stargoog#page/n189/mode/2up Die Kosenamen der Germanen: Eine Studie], [[:de:Franz Stark (Philologe)|Franz Stark]], 1868 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
Its wider use was popularized due to Saint [[Bernhard of Clairvaux]] (canonized 1174).

'''Maarten Stekelenburg''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmaːrtə(n) ˈsteːkələ(n)ˌbɵrx}}; born 22 September 1982) is a Dutch [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Stekelenburg began his career at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], playing 282 matches over nine seasons and winning nine honours, including two [[Eredivisie]] titles. He went on to play for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and Everton.

Stekelenburg made his debut for the Netherlands in 2004, and has earned 58 caps in total as of July 2018. He was understudy to [[Edwin van der Sar]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]], then was first choice as he helped his nation to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] and played at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Stekelenburg began his career at Zandvoort '75 before joining VV Schoten, which he left for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] when he was 15 years old. He made his official debut for Ajax on 24 February 2002, in a match against [[NAC Breda]]. At the start of the 2002–03 season, he won his first prize when Ajax won the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]]. In 2004, he and Ajax won the [[Eredivisie]] championship, having played ten matches that season.

Stekelenburg became the first choice goalkeeper at Ajax in the 2005–06 season. In 2006, he won his first [[KNVB Cup]]. At the start of the 2006–07 season, he won his second Johan Cruyff Shield, which he helped his team defend the next season, and later on in 2006–07, he won his second KNVB Cup.

[[File:Ebecilio Stekelenburg Van der Wiel.jpg|thumb|Stekelenburg with his Ajax teammates]]

Stekelenburg was named Ajax "Player of the Year" for the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]], succeeding [[Wesley Sneijder]].
During the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]], he lost his place in the goal to [[Kenneth Vermeer]] due to injuries. He re-established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper under new manager [[Martin Jol]] and subsequently had a very strong season for both Ajax and the Dutch national side. During the 2009–10 season, Stekelenburg went on to have a consistent season, playing in all of Ajax's Eredivisie and Europa League matches, the latter after they were eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the group stage. However, Stekelenburg sustained a finger injury which kept him out for the remainder of the season. He made a total of 51 appearances in the 2010–11 season in all competitions.

After winning the [[2010–11 Eredivisie]] on 15 May 2011, Stekelenburg dropped the trophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqrrzWN8WKQ|title=Ajax kampioen: Maarten Stekelenburg laat de schaal vallen!!|publisher=YouTube|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; while standing on top of the Ajax team coach with [[Jan Vertonghen]]. He won Ajax Player of the Year for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11854_7055164,00.html |title= Roma told to up Stekelenburg bid |publisher= Sky Sports |date= 22 July 2011 |accessdate= 21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roma===
On 1 August 2011, it was announced Stekelenburg had officially transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for €6.325&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee plus bonuses, making him the first Dutch footballer to ever play for the Italian club.&lt;ref name="Stekelenburg naar AS Roma"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitief: Stekelenburg naar AS Roma &amp;#124; Ajax1.nl &amp;#124; De site met het laatste Ajax nieuws, foto's, Video's, Columns, Twitter, Hyve|url=http://ajax1.nl/archief/definitief-stekelenburg-naar-roma/|publisher=Ajax1.nl|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://res.cloudinary.com/as-roma-turbine-sandbox/image/upload/v1447693974/asroma-uat/hvnwyxqo1gdbhnj1mw2w.pdf|title=Acquisizione A Titolo Definitivo Dei Diritti Alle Prestazioni Sportive Del Calciatore Maarten Stekelenburg|date=1 August 2011|access-date=2 July 2017|publisher=A.S.

===Fulham===
On 3 June 2013, Roma [[director of football|sporting director]] [[Franco Baldini]] confirmed he had finalised a deal with [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for the sale of Stekelenburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11681/8755642/Transfer-news-Roma-confirm-Fulham-deal-for-Maarten-Stekelenburg |title=Transfer news: Roma confirm Fulham deal for Maarten Stekelenburg | publisher=Sky Sports|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on 5 June, Fulham announced Stekelenburg had signed on a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/june/05/stekelenburg|title=Stekelenburg Signs|publisher=Fulham FC|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma later disclosed the fee was €5.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://res.cloudinary.com/as-roma-turbine-sandbox/image/upload/v1445281943/asroma-uat/lugmjrzb0usuepz0d0ew.pdf|title=Relazione Finanziaria Annuale Al 30 Giugno 2014|date=6 October 2014|access-date=28 July 2017|publisher=A.S. Roma|language=Italian|page=122|quote=Valore di Cessione}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 17 August in a 1–0 win away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]; however, he came off injured in the second half and was replaced by [[David Stockdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644878|title=Sunderland 0–1 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on 21 October at a win against Crystal Palace, but went on to lose the next four starts in a row.

Following the sacking of [[René Meulensteen]] as Fulham manager, Stekelenburg was dropped to the bench in favour of Stockdale by [[Felix Magath]], and following Fulham's relegation and Stockdale's departure, lost his place in the squad altogether, as Magath favoured [[Jesse Joronen]] and [[Marcus Bettinelli]].

===Monaco===
On 9 August 2014, Stekelenburg joined French club [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=@simonremoussin |url=http://www.asm-fc.com/en/article/maarten-stekelenburg-joins-as-monaco-on-loan-65465.html |title=Maarten Stekelenburg joins AS Monaco on loan &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; AS Monaco FC |website=Asm-fc.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030161059/http://www.asm-fc.com/en/article/maarten-stekelenburg-joins-as-monaco-on-loan-65465.html |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Danijel Subašić]] as Monaco's starting goalkeeper, Stekelenburg was preferred for cup matches, making his debut in the round of 16 of the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] away to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on 17 December. After a 1–1 draw at the [[Stade de Gerland]], he helped Monaco win 5–4 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] by saving from [[Jordan Ferri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitzus|first1=Alessandro|title=OL – ASM (1–1, 5 t.a.b. 4) : Au bout du suspense, Monaco a sorti Lyon|trans-title= OL – ASM (1–1, 5–4 on penalties): After suspense, Monaco put Lyon out on penalties|url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/coupe-de-la-ligue/2014-2015/ol-asm-1-1-5-t.a.b.-4-au-bout-du-suspense-monaco-a-sorti-lyon_sto4516963/story.shtml|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Eurosport|date=17 December 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-finals on 4 February 2015 against [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] at the [[Stade Louis II]], it again went to penalties after a goalless draw.

==International career==
===Netherlands national football team===
Stekelenburg was a member of the Dutch squad at the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. He made his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 3 September 2004 against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]], whom they beat 3–0.

====2006 World Cup and Euro 2008====
Stekelenburg was called up by manager [[Marco van Basten]] for the squad of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, but he did not play any match during this tournament as [[Edwin van der Sar]] was first choice.

Despite his international debut in 2004, Stekelenburg was called-up to Van Basten's [[UEFA Euro 2008]] squad to play as understudy to Van der Sar. He participated in the Group C match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 17 June—with the Netherlands already having qualified for the quarter-finals, the coach fielded a second-string side to give players like Stekelenburg an appearance. He kept a clean sheet in the 2–0 win at the [[Stade de Suisse]] in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=France 0–2 Italy &amp; Netherlands 2–0 Romania|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7363393.stm|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2008 friendly match against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], Stekelenburg was sent-off after 44 minutes of the first half for fouling [[Joshua Kennedy]], becoming the first goalkeeper of the Dutch national side to receive a red card.

====2010 World Cup and after====

After Van der Sar's retirement from the national team, Stekelenburg became the Netherlands' first-choice goalkeeper under manager [[Bert van Marwijk]]. Stekelenburg was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 | publisher=AFP|date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Van Marwijk announced he would be part of the final 23-man squad participating in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stekelenburg helped the Netherlands reach [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|the final of the competition]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by making key saves throughout the tournament, from [[Kaká]] in the Netherlands' 2–1 victory against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; He conceded six goals in the whole tournament, two of them being [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s. Despite making a number of saves in the final, he ended up on the losing side, conceding the match's only goal to [[Andrés Iniesta]] in the 116th minute.

Stekelenburg played all three matches during the group stages of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] as the Netherlands finished bottom of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group B|their group]].

On 7 October 2016, four years after his last international appearance, Stekelenburg started in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group A|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]], a 4–1 Dutch victory.

===Charlton Athletic===
Lookman joined [[Charlton Athletic]]'s academy in 2014 after signing from Waterloo, a youth football club based in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=114672&amp;headline=Charlton%20keen%20to%20secure%20teenage%20prospect%20Ademola%20Lookman%20to%20new%20contract&amp;sectionIs=sport&amp;searchyear=2015 |title=Charlton keen to secure teenage prospect Ademola Lookman to new contract |first=Richard |last=Cawley |newspaper=South London Press |date=27 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208170257/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=114672&amp;headline=Charlton%20keen%20to%20secure%20teenage%20prospect%20Ademola%20Lookman%20to%20new%20contract&amp;sectionIs=sport&amp;searchyear=2015 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goalscoring record for Charlton's U18 and U21 teams led to him making a rapid ascent through the Charlton academy ranks and he made his first-team debut for the Addicks on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref name=CAFCdebut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3833373 |title=Match report: MK Dons 1–0 Charlton |first=George |last=Jones |publisher=Charlton Athletic F.C. |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015323/https://www.cafc.co.uk/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3833373 |archivedate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 defeat at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 5 December 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34951482|title=Brighton 3-2 Charlton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 December 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then followed that up with both Charlton's goals in a 2–2 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers]] ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35036029|title=Charlton 2-2 Bolton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Lookman signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 5 January 2017 for an undisclosed fee, reported as an initial £7.5m potentially rising to £11m with add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/10718733/everton-sign-ademola-lookman-from-charlton-for-7-5m |title=Everton sign Ademola Lookman from Charlton for £7.5m |first=Paul |last=Vinnell |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38520520 |title=Ademola Lookman: Everton sign Charlton forward for £11m |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 January 2017|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club ten days later in a 4–0 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], replacing [[Ross Barkley]] in the 90th minute and scoring the team's fourth goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38545988|title=Everton 4-0 Manchester City |first=Luke |last=Reddy |publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 January 2017|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lookman made his first Euro appearance for Everton in a 1–0 win over [[MFK Ružomberok]] in the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] third qualifying round first leg.&lt;ref name=EuroDebut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40724022 |title=Baines gives Everton Europa lead on Rooney return |date=27 July 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Tom |last=Rostance |accessdate=27 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although manager [[Sam Allardyce]] stated that Lookman would not be leaving on loan in the January 2018 transfer window, he changed his mind, and the club arranged a move to Championship club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], where they hoped he would play regular first-team football. However, the player insisted on an alternative move, and joined [[Bundesliga]] club [[RB Leipzig]] until the end of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-wanted-ademola-lookman-stay-14232472 |title=Everton wanted Ademola Lookman to stay in England with Championship club |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=1 February 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/02/01/everton-boss-sam-allardyce-claims-ademola-lookmans-stubbornness-took-him-rb-leipzig-over-derby |title=Everton boss Sam Allardyce claims Ademola Lookman's 'stubbornness' took him to RB Leipzig over Derby |website=Sports Illustrated |date=1 February 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11231037/ademola-lookman-joins-rb-leipzig-on-loan-from-everton |title=Ademola Lookman joins RB Leipzig on loan from Everton |first=Rory |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 January 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first game with Leipzig, Lookman scored the winning goal in the away game against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] after coming on as a late substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/05/ademola-lookman-slips-slides-from-everton-into-leipzig-affections |title=Ademola Lookman slips and slides from Everton into Leipzig’s affections |first=Andy|last= Brassell |date= 5 February 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Las Palmas]], Canary Islands, Sandro joined [[FC Barcelona]]'s youth setup in 2009, aged 14, after starting out at local [[UD Las Palmas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol-base/sandro-ramirez-con-licencia-para-marcar-1197242|title=Sandro Ramírez, con licencia para marcar|trans-title=Sandro Ramírez, licence to score|newspaper=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|location=Barcelona|language=es|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2013, he was promoted to [[FC Barcelona B|the former's B-team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.es/futbol/barca-b/detalle/noticia/siete-juveniles-suben-al-barca-b-para-la-temporada-2013-14|title=Siete juveniles suben al Barça B para la temporada 2013/14|trans-title=Seven youth players promoted to Barça B for 2013/14 season|publisher=FC Barcelona|language=es|date=10 June 2013|accessdate=13 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011949/http://www.fcbarcelona.es/futbol/barca-b/detalle/noticia/siete-juveniles-suben-al-barca-b-para-la-temporada-2013-14|archivedate=5 March 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his professional debut on 17 August in a 1–2 away loss against [[CD Mirandés]] for the [[Segunda División]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/08/17/futbol/equipos/mirandes/1376767969.html|title=Prieto sostiene al Mirandés|trans-title=Prieto sustains Mirandés|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|location=Madrid|language=es|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandro scored his first goal as a professional on 15 September 2013, netting the first of a 2–0 home win against [[Real Madrid Castilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/09/15/futbol/2adivision/1379246488.html|title=El filial azulgrana se lleva con claridad el 'mini' Clásico |trans-title=Azulgrana reserves clear winners of 'mini' Clásico|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=es|date=15 September 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished [[2013–14 Segunda División|the campaign]] with 31 appearances, netting seven times to help his team finish third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.es/futbol/barca-b/detalle/noticia/temporada/2013-2014/todos-los-goles-del-barca-b-2013-14|title=Todos los goles del Barça B 2013–14|trans-title=All 2013–14 Barça B goals|publisher=FC Barcelona|language=es|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2014, Sandro scored the last of a 6–0 triumph over [[Club León]] for that year's [[Joan Gamper Trophy]], after [[Assist (football)|assisting]] fellow youth graduate [[Munir El Haddadi]] in the fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/match-archive/2014-2015/joan-gamper-trophy/fc-barcelona_leon-f-c|title=FC Barcelona-León F.C|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also called up to the main squad for the match against [[Elche CF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2014/08/24/futbol/equipos/barcelona/1408873771.html|title=Neymar, baja contra el Elche |trans-title=Neymar, out against Elche|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=es|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually remained unused in the 3–0 [[La Liga]] win on 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-divisi%C3%A3%C2%B3n/match/402623/barcelona-elche/report|title=Enrique off to a winning start|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandro made his debut in the [[Spanish football league system|Spanish top level]] on 31 August 2014, coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Pedro (footballer, born July 1987)|Pedro]] midway through the second half of the fixture at [[Villarreal CF]] and scoring the game's only goal 12 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-divisi%C3%A3%C2%B3n/match/402610/villarreal-barcelona/report|title=Sandro Ramirez strikes to give Barcelona victory over Villarreal|publisher=ESPN FC|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He netted for the first time in the [[UEFA Champions League]] on 21 October, contributing to a [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|3–1 group stage home win]] against [[AFC Ajax]] with an injury-time strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/match/405730/barcelona-ajax-amsterdam/report |title=Lionel Messi draws level with Ronaldo as Barcelona cruise past Ajax|publisher=ESPN FC|date=21 October 2014|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December, he scored his first goal in the [[Copa del Rey]], in a [[2014–15 Copa del Rey|8–1 home routing]] of [[SD Huesca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2014_15/copa/dieciseisavos/vuelta/bar_hue/|title=Los suplentes culés también cuentan|trans-title=The culé backups also count|newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid|language=es|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Málaga===
On 2 July 2016, [[Málaga CF]] leaked news of the potential signing of Sandro, and their official website temporarily featured a player profile, shortly after his release from Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuevofutbol.com/2016/07/el-malaga-filtra-el-fichaje-de-sandro-ramirez.html|title=El Málaga filtra el fichaje de Sandro Ramírez|trans-title=Málaga filter signing of Sandro Ramírez|publisher=Nuevo Fútbol|language=es|date=2 July 2016|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, they officially announced his signing on a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malagacf.com/noticia/el-malaga-cf-incorpora-a-sandro-ramirez|title=El Málaga CF incorpora a Sandro Ramírez|trans-title=Málaga CF add Sandro Ramírez|publisher=Málaga CF|language=es|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 19 August, starting as they began [[2016–17 La Liga|the season]] with a 1–1 draw against [[CA Osasuna]], and scored his first goal four weeks later to equalise in a 2–1 win over [[SD Eibar]] also at [[La Rosaleda Stadium|La Rosaleda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deia.com/2016/09/21/deportes/futbol/el-malaga-gana-al-eibar-y-elude-la-crisis|title=El Málaga gana al Eibar y elude la crisis|trans-title=Málaga defeat Eibar and avoid crisis|newspaper=[[Deia (newspaper)|Deia]]|location=Bilbao|language=es|date=21 September 2016|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2017, Sandro took his [[2016–17 Málaga CF season|season]] tally to 11 after helping defeat former club Barcelona 2–0 at home, netting the first through a solo effort that started in his own half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/04/09/neymar-sees-red-sandro-shocks-former-club-barca|title=Neymar sees red as Sandro shocks former club Barca|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=9 April 2017|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
On 3 July 2017, Sandro signed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on a four-year contract after the club triggered a £5.2&amp;nbsp;million release clause in his Málaga contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/03/everton-sign-sandro-ramirez-malaga-spain-under-21|title=Everton complete signing of Burnley defender Michael Keane for £25m|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=3 July 2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2715161-sandro-ramirez-completes-everton-transfer-from-malaga-on-4-year-contract|title=Sandro Ramirez completes Everton transfer from Malaga on 4-year contract|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=3 July 2017|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 12 August, starting in a 1–0 home win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40835425|title=Everton 1–0 Stoke City|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Alex|last=Bysouth|date=12 August 2017|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 January 2018, Sandro joined [[Sevilla FC]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] for the remainder of [[2017–18 La Liga|the campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42882208|title=Everton: Sandro Ramirez joins Sevilla as Napoli want Davy Klaassen|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=30 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly seven months later, in the same situation, he moved to [[Real Sociedad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realsociedad.eus/en/news/details/agreement-for-sandro-ramirez-to-play-on-loan|title=Agreement for Sandro Ramírez to play on loan|publisher=Real Sociedad|date=30 August 2018|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse''' (born 18 April 1990) is a Senegalese professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]]. 

Niasse has played top-flight football in Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Russia and England. He won the 2011 [[Senegal Premier League]] with [[US Ouakam|Ouakam]] and scored in [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]'s win in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final]]. He signed for Everton for a £13.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee in 2016. Niasse made his full international debut for Senegal in 2013.

==Club career==
===Ouakam===
Born in [[Ouakam]], [[Dakar Department]], Niasse began his football career with hometown club [[US Ouakam]] in the second tier. He signed his first professional contract with Ouakam in 2008 and in the 2008–09 season helped his team win the Second League title by scoring 21 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2014/01/09/gol-silahi-oumar-niasse-350690|title=Gol silahı Oumar Niasse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing as a winger, Niasse also played a key role in Ouakam winning the [[Senegal Premier League]] title in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oumar Niasse: Meet the hard-working Senegalese striker wanted in England|url = http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/oumar-niasse-meet-hard-working-senegalese-striker-wanted-england#:0solhCmynml5YA|website = FourFourTwo|accessdate = 2 February 2016|date = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niasse started a trial with Norwegian club [[SK Brann|Brann]] in February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ba.no/sport/fotball/brann/article5907691.ece Han kan være Branns nye kantspiller] ba.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after impressing signed for the club on a six-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece Doddo-bloggen: Signér Niasse!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212095503/http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece |date=12 February 2012 }} aftenposten.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ – Er her for å bli bedre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120223060545/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ |date=23 February 2012 }} brann.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Norway was hampered by poor form and injuries, and he returned to Senegal after playing just three [[Tippeligaen]] matches.

===Akhisar Belediyespor===
After a trial period with French club [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]], Niasse was offered a contract to join the club but refused the offer.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} He joined the summer camp of Turkish [[Süper Lig]] club [[Akhisar Belediyespor]] and signed permanently with them in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yazete.com/spor/akhisarda-oumar-niasse-de-tamam-660796.html|title=Akhisar'da Oumar Niasse de tamam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2013/08/08/akhisara-senegalli-328718|title=Akhisar'a Senegalli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse scored on his debut in Turkey and ultimately finished the season with 15 goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Lokomotiv Moscow===
[[File:Loco-Terec (4).jpg|thumb|Niasse in action for Lokomotiv against [[FC Akhmat Grozny|Terek Grozny]] in October 2014]]
Before the 2014–15 season, Niasse signed with Russian club [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] in July 2014 for a €5.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref name="sway" /&gt;  He scored Lokomotiv's equalising goal in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final|Russian Cup Final]] against [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] on 21 May 2015 as his side went on to win 3–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/05/21/russia/cup/fk-lokomotiv-moscow/fc-kuban-krasnodar/2031399/ |accessdate=12 January 2016 |title=Lokomotiv Moskva vs. Kuban' Krasnodar 3 – 1 |website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Niasse joined English [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 February 2016 for a transfer fee of approximately £13.5&amp;nbsp;million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Everton F.C.]]|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/02/01/niasse-completes-13-5-move|title=Niasse Completes £13.5m Move|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/oumar-niasse-everton-lokomotiv-moscow-premier-league|title=Everton poised to sign Lokomotiv Moscow's Oumar Niasse for £13.5m|first=David|last=Hytner|date=30 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] on 20 February 2016, entering as an 80th-minute substitute for striker [[Romelu Lukaku]]. 

After 152 minutes of football in his first season at the club, Niasse was not given a squad number for the following 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/03/premier-league-2016-17-preview-everton|title=Premier League 2016–17 Preview Everton|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was informed by then-Everton manager [[Ronald Koeman]] he would need to search for a new club during the summer 2016 transfer window, saying, "[I]f Niasse likes to play football he needs to leave Everton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bascombe|first1=Chris|title=Everton manager Ronald Koeman tells Oumar Niasse to find another club – just six months after his arrival|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/18/everton-manager-ronald-koeman-tells-oumar-niasse-to-find-another/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, following the close of the transfer deadline for loaning and signing players in England, he was listed as part of the 25-man Everton squad for the 2016–17 season submitted on 1 September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Ian|title=Oumar Niasse included in Everton's Premier League squad|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/oumar-niasse-included-evertons-premier-11831437|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually issued squad number 24. 

In October 2016, Niasse was demoted to the under-23 squad and had his personal locker revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez|title=Everton’s Oumar Niasse: ‘It’s really sad.

====Loan to Hull City====
On 13 January 2017, Niasse signed a loan contract with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until the end of the 2016–17 season with an option for a £10&amp;nbsp;million permanent transfer from Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =David|last=Anderson |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-flop-oumar-niasse-joins-9615346|title=Everton flop Oumar Niasse joins Hull on loan with view to permanent £10m switch |date=13 January 2017 |newspaper=The Mirror|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull City sign Oumar Niasse on loan and Evandro for undisclosed fee |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38611524 |newspaper=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut the next day as an 83rd-minute substitute for [[Abel Hernández]] in a 3–1 home win against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38539371  | title = Hull City 3–1 Bournemouth | date = 14 January 2017 | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for Hull and in English football came on 26 January in the [[EFL Cup]] semi-final second leg against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he made his first start for the club.

====Return to Everton====
After returning to Everton, Niasse made his first appearance since his return as a substitute in the [[2017–18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] third round match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 20 September 2017, scoring Everton's third goal of a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249724|title= Everton 3–0 Sunderland|accessdate = 21 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Ronald Koeman named Niasse in Everton's 25-man Premier League squad upon his return from loan and consequently issued him a squad number. However, Koeman omitted Niasse from Everton's [[UEFA Europa League]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/everton-ronald-koeman-europa-league|title=Everton’s Koeman has no regrets over Oumar Niasse’s Europa League snub|work=The Guardian|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September, Niasse scored two goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–1 Premier League win, helping Everton to come back from a goal down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41290322|title= Everton 2–1 Bournemouth|accessdate = 23 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November, Niasse scored Everton's first goal in a 3–2 home win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], having been losing 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41792811|title=Everton 3–2 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, he scored in a 2–2 draw away to bottom side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41951923|title=Crystal Palace 2–2 Everton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse sparked controversy in the match by appearing to dive to win Everton a penalty, which was converted by [[Leighton Baines]] to make the score 1–1 in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/oumar-niasse-facing-retrospective-diving-ban-after-winning-contentious-penalty-at-crystal-palace-a3695611.html|title=Oumar Niasse facing retrospective diving ban after winning contentious penalty at Crystal Palace|work=London Evening Standard|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became the first Premier League player to be charged with "successful deception of a match official" under [[The Football Association]]'s new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42066734|title=Oumar Niasse: Everton striker charged for dive against Crystal Palace|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton appealed the verdict, but the FA rejected the appeal and Niasse received a two-match suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11138846/evertons-oumar-niasse-has-appeal-to-simulation-ban-rejected-by-fa|title=Niasse given two-match ban for diving|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 November 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhamed Bešić''' ({{IPA-sh|muxǎmed běʃitɕ|bs}}; born 10 September 1992) is a Bosnian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C|Middlesbrough]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]].

Bešić started his professional career at [[Hamburger SV]], playing mainly in its [[Hamburger SV II|reserve team]], before moving to [[Ferencvárosi TC (football)|Ferencváros]] in 2012. Two years later he joined Everton. He was loaned to Middlesbrough in 2018.

A former youth international for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bešić made his senior international debut in 2010, and is the youngest player ever to represent the country. He made over 30 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] since and represented the nation at their first major tournament, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Berlin]] to Bosnian parents, Bešić joined local club [[Tennis Borussia Berlin|TB Berlin]] at the age of 14, where he remained until he was 16, when he signed for [[Hamburger SV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/middlesbrough-je-raskrsnica-za-karijeru-muhameda-besica/267125|title=Middlesbrough je raskrsnica za karijeru Muhameda Bešića|website=sportsport.ba|date=4 February 2018|accessdate=5 February 2018|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2010, Bešić signed his first professional contract with Hamburger SV until June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/besic-do-ljeta-2013-godine-u-hamburgu/46128|title=Bešić do ljeta 2013. godine u Hamburgu|website=sportsport.ba|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=3 July 2011|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut in [[Bundesliga]] game against [[Borussia Dortmund]] on 12 November 2010 at the age of 18. Bešić came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the 80th minute when Dortmund was already leading 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/besic-debitovao-za-hamburg/46548|title=Bešić debitovao za Hamburg|website=sportsport.ba|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, he started his first Bundesliga game away at [[Hannover 96]], and played full 90 minutes in a 3–2 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/ibisevic-postigao-dva-gola-u-dvije-minute-mujdza-zabio-autogol/101120062|title=Ibišević postigao dva gola u dvije minute, Mujdža zabio autogol|website=klix.ba|date=20 November 2010|accessdate=23 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Bešić was suspended from the first team, due to lack of discipline. Bosnian media also claimed that manager [[Thorsten Fink]] "strangled" Bešić and threw him out of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/fink-daveci-izbacio-besica-iz-svlacionice/77473|title=Fink daveći izbacio Bešića iz svlačionice|website=sportsport.ba|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferencváros===
In 2012 Bešić was signed by Hungarian club [[Ferencvárosi TC (football)|Ferencváros]] on [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scsport.ba/vijesti/jos-jedan-bh-internacionalac-u-madjarskoj-kiso-potpisao-za-debrecen/42936|title=Još jedan bh internacionalac u Mađarskoj, Kiso potpisao za Debrecen|website=scsport.ba|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=12 September 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first and only goal for the club in an away victory over [[Paksi FC|Paksi]], which was also his first professional goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://24.hu/sport/foci/2013/05/05/nem-adja-magat-konnyen-a-fradi/|title=Nem adja magát könnyen a Fradi|website=24.hu|date=5 May 2013|accessdate=21 July 2018|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season, he helped the team win [[Ligakupa]] by beating [[MOL Vidi FC|MOL Vidi]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/predstavljamo-zmajeve-muhamed-besic-je-zvijezda-u-usponu/140531097|title=Predstavljamo Zmajeve: Muhamed Bešić je zvijezda u usponu|website=klix.ba|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=6 March 2016|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Bešić prolonged his contract with Ferencváros until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/muhamed-besic-u-ferencvarosu-do-2016-godine/109020|title=Muhamed Bešić u Ferencvarošu do 2016. godine|website=sportsport.ba|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=3 November 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
On 28 July 2014 Bešić signed a five-year contract with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for an undisclosed fee, speculated to be in the region of £4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/everton-complete-4m-signing-muhamed-7522246|title=Everton complete £4m signing of Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been an unused substitute in the first two games of the season, he made his first [[Premier League]] appearance on 30 August against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], replacing [[Romelu Lukaku]] in the 89th minute; however he made a defensive error which allowed opponent [[Diego Costa]] to score the final goal in a 3–6 home defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2738380/Everton-3-6-Chelsea-Quickfire-Diego-Costa-sparks-goal-rush-Blues-maintain-perfect-start.html|title=Everton 3-6 Chelsea: Quickfire Diego Costa sparks goal rush as Blues maintain perfect start|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić made his first start for Everton in the [[Merseyside derby]] on 27 September, being substituted after 80 minutes for [[Samuel Eto'o]] as the game ended in a 1–1 away draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-1-1-everton-phil-jagielka-4332406|title=Liverpool 1-1 Everton: Phil Jagielka wonder strike secures late point for the Toffees|website=mirror.co.uk|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second season at Everton was plagued by [[hamstring]] injuries, which limited his appearances and playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.in/football/everton/story/2542958/muhamed-besic-to-miss-start-of-everton-season-for-hamstring|title=Everton's Muhamed to miss start of season with injured hamstring|website=espn.in|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/injury-news/news/besic-injury-absence-frustrating_258292.html|title=Muhamed Besic: Injury absence is frustrating|website=sportsmole.co.uk|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-blow-mo-besic-suffers-10781429|title=Everton blow as Mo Besic suffers recurrence of hamstring injury|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=24 January 2016|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016 he was voted Everton's Player of the Month for January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mo-besic-everton-player-month-10906801|title=Mo Besic is Everton Player of the Month for January|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=17 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also extended his contract until June 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skysports.com/football/news/11671/10186863/muhamed-besic-has-signed-a-deal-which-will-keep-him-at-everton-until-2021|title=Muhamed Besic signs new Everton deal until the summer of 2021|website=skysports.com|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Bešić was ruled out for about six month as he [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore anterior cruciate ligament]] in his right knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bbc.com/sport/football/36983793|title=Muhamed Besic: Everton midfielder out for six months with knee injury|website=bbc.com|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić was slowly making his way back to full fitness as he was involved with Everton Under-23s' in mid-April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://royalbluemersey.sbnation.com/2017/4/15/15310250/everton-burnley-injury-report-match-preview-besic-two-weeks-schneiderlin|title=Besic still a couple of weeks away for Everton|website=royalbluemersey.com|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed the whole [[2016–17 Everton F.C. season|2016–17]] campaign, not playing a single minute for Everton, before eventually returning to action coming on as a 77th-minute substitute for his national team on 9 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-midfielder-muhamed-besic-gets-13168238|title=Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic gets much-needed action in Bosnia draw|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=10 June 2017|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić returned to Premier League action on 21 August 2017, almost 16 months since his last game, in a 1–1 away draw at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/21/manchester-city-vs-everton-premier-league-live/|title=Wayne Rooney scores but Raheem Sterling levels it as both sides finish with ten|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After falling out of favor at Everton, in January 2018, Bešić joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42898285|title=Middlesbrough sign Everton's Muhamed Besic and Huddersfield's Martin Cranie|website=bbc.co.uk|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted on 17 February against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-energy-levels-scale-14304067|title=Cardiff City's energy levels are off the scale once again as Middlesbrough become the latest victims of a Neil Warnock masterclass|website=walesonline.co.uk|date=18 February 2018|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić scored his first goal for Middlesbrough, which was also his first goal in over four years, against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 21 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5641875/Derby-1-2-Middlesbrough-Muhamed-Besic-Britt-Assombalonga-dent-Rams-play-hopes-away-win.html|title=Derby 1-2 Middlesbrough: Muhamed Besic and Britt Assombalonga dent Rams play-off hopes in away win|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić returned to Middlesbrough on a season-long loan in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6090633/Middlesbrough-confirm-signing-Everton-midfielder-Mo-Besic-one-year-loan.html|title=Middlesbrough confirm the signing of Everton midfielder Mo Besic on one-year loan|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=23 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20150331 2213 AUT BIH 2666.jpg|thumb|Bešić playing for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 2015]]

Bešić claimed in an interview that he had declined an offer to play for [[Germany national football team|Germany]], because he only wished to play for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://faktor.ba/vijest/besic-imao-samo-poziv-njemacke-srce-je-odabralo-bih/7305|title=Bešić: Imao sam poziv Njemačke, srce je odabralo BiH|website=klix.ba|date=14 October 2018|accessdate=16 October 2018|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/muhamed-besic-spahicev-nasljednik-i-vodja-u-21-reprezentacije/130609013|title=Muhamed Bešić, Spahićev nasljednik i vođa U21 reprezentacije|website=klix.ba|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=12 June 2013|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2010, Bešić was called-up to the senior team by [[Safet Sušić]] for [[Exhibition game|friendly]] game against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiosarajevo.ba/sport/nogomet/debi-besica-povratak-salihovica-i-zeca/36734|title=Debi Bešića, povratak Salihovića i Zeca|website=radiosarajevo.ba|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=7 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in that match, thereby becoming the youngest player to ever play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at senior level. The record was previously held by [[Miralem Pjanić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/zmajevi-preokrenuli-protiv-slovaka-za-vaznu-pobjedu/101117098|title=Zmajevi preokrenuli protiv Slovaka za važnu pobjedu|website=klix.ba|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić was selected to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], country's first ever major competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/bosnia-and-herzegovina/10810419/Bosnia-Herzegovina-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 2014 World Cup squad|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his tournament debut in the opening group game, which ended in a narrow loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255931/match=300186477/match-report.html|title=Bosnia beaten by Messi marvel|website=fifa.com|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given a straight red card on 6 September 2015, in a 3–0 home win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifying game for throwing his chewing gum at [[Víctor Rodríguez (Andorran footballer)|Víctor Rodríguez]], who was also sent off for retaliating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/bih-u-nervoznoj-utakmici-lako-slavila-protiv-andore/170984|title=BiH u nervoznoj utakmici lako slavila protiv Andore|website=sportsport.ba|date=6 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2015|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
During his career, Bešić has been deployed as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] and as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre back]], although his natural position by his own words is [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/muhamed-besic-za-klix-ba-sada-igram-na-poziciji-desnog-beka-i-dobro-mi-ide/140405078|title=Muhamed Bešić: Sada igram na poziciji desnog beka i dobro mi ide|website=klix.ba|date=5 April 2014|accessdate=6 April 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was described in 2014 by Everton manager [[Roberto Martínez]] as a "very complete footballer", who "has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he's a technical player on the ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/martinez-besic-ima-predispozicije-za-nevjerovatnu-karijeru/137921|title=Martínez: Bešić ima predispozicije za nevjerovatnu karijeru|website=sportsport.ba|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Vlašić made list of the world's top 40 footballers born in 1997, compiled by ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/14/next-generation-2014-40-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football|title=Next Generation 2014: 40 of the best young talents in world football|date=14 October 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Hajduk Split===
Born in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] to the family of the athletics coach [[Joško Vlašić]], as the younger brother of the world champion [[high jump]]er [[Blanka Vlašić]], Nikola's future football career was viewed as a "project" by his father, who started training him personally ever since he was four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/ostali-sportovi/josko-vlasic-nije-nikola-projekt-za-zaradu-922719|title=Joško Vlašić: Nije Nikola projekt za zaradu|date=22 February 2014|publisher=Večernji list|language=Croatian|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vlašić went on to join the [[NK Omladinac Vranjic]] academy, before he was brought to [[HNK Hajduk Split]], aged 12. He made his debut for the Croatia U16 national football team at the age of 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hns-cff.hr/en/players/119418/nikola-vlasic/|title=Statistics - Caps: Nikola Vlašić|publisher=Croatian Football Federation|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing regularly with older teammates at U17 and U18 levels as well. He excelled at youth club level as well, and in the 2013–2014 season he formed a potent midfield partnership for the Hajduk U17 team with [[Andrija Balić]], which resulted in the team finishing the first half of the season in first place, without a single loss. The two then received and signed professional contracts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/potpisali-vlasic-hairlahovic-i-balic-ocekujemo-puno-od-njih-349501|title=Potpisali Vlašić, Hairlahović i Balić: Očekujemo puno od njih|date=16 January 2014|publisher=24sata|language=Croatian|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were moved to the U19 team, where he played regularly.

He made his first team debut in the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifying match on 17 July 2014, playing in the away match against [[Dundalk F.C.]]. Scoring on his debut, he became [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]'s youngest scorer in international competitions, aged 16 years and 9 months, 2 months less than the previous record holder [[Mario Tičinović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gol.dnevnik.hr/clanak/nogomet/rijeka-protiv-fradija-na-kantridi-hajduk-u-irskoj-split-na-parku-mladezi---344500.html|title=Hajduk slavio u Irskoj: Nikola Vlašić najmlađi strijelac 'bijelih' u povijesti!|date=17 July 2014|publisher=Gol.hr|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season, Vlašić went on to make 37 appearances in all competitions, scoring four goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/prva-momcad/nikola-vlasic/8|title=Prva momčad • HNK Hajduk Split|website=hajduk.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2016, Hajduk announced that Vlašić had been appointed vice-captain of the club, with [[Lovre Kalinić]] continuing to be the captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/vijest/kalinic-je-kapetan--a-nikola-vlasic-njegov-nasljednik/7423|title=Kalinić je kapetan, a Nikola Vlašić njegov nasljednik!|website=hajduk.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kalinić was on extended holidays as a result of being part of the Croatian squad at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Vlašić captained Hajduk for the first time on 14 July 2016, the season opening fixture; a 2–2 away draw against [[CS Municipal Studențesc Iași]] in the second round of the [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|2016–17 Europa League qualifying phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2017/matches/round=2000789/match=2020096/postmatch/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League 2016/17 - History - CSMS laşi-Hajduk Split – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|website=Uefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his tender age, Vlašić would captain the side four further times that season.

===Everton===
On 31 August 2017, Vlašić signed a five-year deal with [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a fee of around £10m, the highest fee [[Hajduk Split]] have ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Nikola Vlasic: Everton seal £10m deal for Hajduk Split forward|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41078149|accessdate=14 September 2017|work=BBC Sport|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2017/08/31/blues-sign-vlasic|title=Blues Sign Vlasic|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Everton FC|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlašić impressed Everton manager [[Ronald Koeman]] and director of football Steve Walsh when Everton and Hajduk faced each other in the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]] play-off round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Nikola Vlasic: Everton seal £10m deal for Hajduk Split forward|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41078149|website=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vlasic scored his first goal for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on his debut at Goodison Park to put Everton ahead against [[Apollon Limassol]] in the [[Europa League]], in the 66th minute on 28 September 2017.

===CSKA Moscow===
On 15 August 2018, Russian club [[PFC CSKA Moscow]] announced that Vlašić joined them on loan for the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[PFC CSKA Moscow]]|url=https://en.pfc-cska.com/news/team-news/nikola-vlai-joins-pfc-cska/|title=Nikola Vlašić joins PFC CSKA|date=15 August 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2018  Vlašić scored the winning goal against title holders Real Madrid on the 2nd minute in the 2018/19  UCL.

On 18 November 2018, he provided an assist to [[Andrej Kramarić]]  in a [[UEFA Nations League]] match against [[England national football team|England]] for a 0-1 lead, which Croatia eventually lost 2-1.

====Coventry (loan)====
On 27 November 2014, Pennington joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on loan until 4 January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2014/11/27/pennington-loaned-to-coventry|title=Pennington Loaned To Coventry|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was subsequently extended to 7 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30637098|title=Matty Pennington: Everton defender extends Coventry loan|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, he was voted as the club's Player of the Month in a poll conducted by the ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/everton-loan-star-matthew-pennington-8411797|title=Everton loan star Matthew Pennington is YOUR Coventry City Telegraph Player of the Month|author=Aidan McCartney|date=9 January 2015|newspaper=Coventry Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February 2015, his loan was extended to the end of the season, with Pennington from then on being played more consistently at his more natural centre back position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31312083|title=Matthew Pennington: Coventry City extend defender's loan deal|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennington was named as Coventry City Young Player of the Year 2014–15, voted for unanimously by Coventry City manager Tony Mowbray and his coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/article/matthew-pennington-young-player-coventry-city-2444127.aspx|title=Matthew Pennington voted as the Coventry City 2014/15 Young Player of the Year|author=Kieran Crowley|publisher=Coventry City F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/05/06/pennington-picks-up-sky-blues-award|title=Pennington picks up Sky Blues award|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Walsall (loan)====
On 23 March 2016, Pennington joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] on loan until the end of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/03/24/pennington-loaned-to-walsall|title=Pennington loaned to Walsall|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played 5 games at the club, before Everton activated a recall clause just 28 days into his loan spell.

====Everton return====
On 21 April 2016, his loan was terminated at the minimum 28-day point due to a defensive crisis at his home club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-recall-matthew-pennington-loan-11223814|title=Everton recall Matthew Pennington|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to be available for Everton's FA Cup semi-final against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. After picking up a hamstring injury in the final day of the [[Premier League]] 2015/16 season on 15 May 2016 in a 3–0 victory against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everton 3 Norwich 0|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240381|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=15 May 2016|accessdate=15 May 2016|first=Neil|last=Johnstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a recurrence of the injury in pre-season required surgery and ruled Pennington out until January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennington on comeback trail|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2017/01/09/pennington-on-comeback-trail|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=8 January 2017|accessdate=18 July 2017|first=Rob|last=Urbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Connolly began his career at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and has earned representation at [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17]] and [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkbride|first1=Phil|title=Everton youngster Callum Connolly cuts holiday short to prepare for new season|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-youngster-callum-connolly-cuts-9582572|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 2016, he joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on a one-month loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton defender Callum Connolly joins Barnsley on one-month loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35717908|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut two days later, in a 3–1 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the [[Bescot Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walsall 1 – 3 Barnsley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35675595|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connolly made his first Everton teamsheet on 16 April 2016, when he was named as a substitute for the 1–1 draw with Southampton, coming on as a second-half substitute for injured right-back [[Seamus Coleman]] to make his Premier League debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton debutants revel in 'dream come true' moment|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-debutants-revel-dream-come-11197134|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke Samuel Garbutt''' (born 21 May 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Harrogate]], [[North Yorkshire]],&lt;ref name=Hugman/&gt; Garbutt attended [[Harrogate Grammar School]] where he played in the Year 7 School Football team that reached the Harrogate and District Cup Final in 2005. His impressive performances for his junior club team, Pannal Ash Juniors, saw him signed by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] where he began his professional career. Shortly after leaving school, he was signed from their academy by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009, for an initial fee of £600,000 which was set by a tribunal as the two clubs could not agree a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton reveal Luke Garbutt compensation fee|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/6154979/Everton-reveal-Luke-Garbutt-compensation-fee.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=8 September 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was loaned to [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] during the 2011–12 season.

In the [[2012–13 Everton F.C. season|2012–13 season]] Garbutt made his Everton debut, coming on at half-time during a 5–0 [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] second-round win over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on 29 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2194845/Everton-v-Leyton-Orient-live.html | title=Capital One Cup Live: Everton 5 Leyton Orient 0 – as it happened from Goodison Park |newspaper=Daily Mail | accessdate=29 August 2012 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Ripley | date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Garbutt signed a new two-year contract with Everton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton left-back Luke Garbutt signs new two-year contract|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8803812/Everton-left-back-Luke-Garbutt-signs-new-two-year-contract|publisher=Sky Sports|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the season went to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on loan.

'''Kevin Antonio Joel Gislain Mirallas y Castillo''' (born 5 October 1987), more commonly known as '''Kevin Mirallas''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkeβin miˈɾaʎas}}), is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

Mirallas started his professional career in [[Ligue 1|France]] with [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] before moving to [[Superleague Greece|Greece]] with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in 2010. Mirallas enjoyed success during his time at Olympiacos scoring 34 goals in 52 league games, including being the league's [[Greek Superleague Top Goalscorer|top scorer]] in his second season with 20 goals in 25 games. His impressive performances attracted the attention of Everton who signed him in the summer of 2012 for £6 million.

Mirallas has over 50 caps for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] since his senior debut in 2007. He has represented Belgium at various youth levels and has featured for them at senior level at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]; the latter of which he helped his team reach the quarter-final.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mirallas spent his youth career playing for his hometown club [[Standard Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/08/19/blues-complete-mirallas-swoop | title=Blues Complete Mirallas Swoop | publisher=[[Everton F.C.]] | accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then left Belgium and began his first team career in France by signing for [[Lille OSC]] and played for them since the opening of the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref name="Mirallas"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/kevin-mirallas/2073/ | title=K.

Mirallas subsequently was transferred to [[AS Saint-Étienne]] for €4 million, and began to make a name for himself by scoring against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on his debut in the Rhone-Loire derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/22778/o-lyon-vs-as-saint-etienne/preview?ICID=OP|title=O.

===Everton===
In August 2012, Mirallas joined [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a reported fee of £6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19265336 | title=Everton sign Kevin Mirallas from Olympiakos for £6m | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut as a second-half substitute during a 3–1 [[Premier League|league]] win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park in which he had a headed goal disallowed due to it being ruled offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19304226 | title=Aston Villa 1–3 Everton | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first start four days later, Mirallas scored twice and provided two assists as Everton won 5–0 against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] in the second round of the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19340512 | title=Everton 5–0 Leyton Orient | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first league goal on 22 September 2012, in a 3–0 away win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] after heading in his initial effort which rebounded off the underside of the bar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19615118 "Swansea 0–3 Everton"] BBC Sport. 22 September 2012. Retrieved 22 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas suffered a number of injuries which limited his number of appearances during the middle part of the season. He made a number of brief cameos, notably against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December. Mirallas' next goal came against [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C|Oldham Athletic]] in a 3–1 win on 26 February 2013 in the fifth round of the [[2012–13 FA Cup|FA Cup]].

On 18 September 2014, Mirallas scored his first European goal for Everton, in a 4–1 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg|Wolfsburg]] in the first match of their [[2014-15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29240782 |title=Everton marked their Europa League return with a dominant victory over Germans Wolfsburg at Goodison Park. |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new three-year contract with the club in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirallas Pens New Deal|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/08/07/mirallas-pens-new-deal|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Olympiacos====
On 7 January 2018, Mirallas agreed to return to former club Olympiacos on loan until the end of the [[2017–18 Olympiacos F.C. season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everton forward Kevin Mirallas has rejoined Greek club Olympiakos on loan until the end of the season.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42593788|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 January 2018|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club did not have an option to purchase Mirallas as part of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11198607/kevin-mirallas-leaves-everton-for-olympiakos|publisher=Sky Sports|title=Kevin Mirallas leaves Everton for Olympiacos|date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, Mirallas scored a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty area on the stroke of half-time in a 5–1 home win against [[Kerkyra F.C.|Kerkyra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onsports.gr/podosfairo/superleague/story/594339/olympiakos-kerkyra-5-1-pentara-me-tin-ayra-toy-martins |title=Ολυμπιακός – Κέρκυρα 5–1: Πεντάρα με την… αύρα του Μαρτίνς |publisher=www.onsports.gr | language = Greek | date = 16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May, his loan spell was terminated by mutual consent due to Everton's high asking price to purchase Mirallas outright, as well as Mirallas' overall sub-par performances with Olympiacos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/Superleague/olympiacos/parelthon-apo-ton-olympiako-o-miralas.5184702.html|title=Παρελθόν από τον Ολυμπιακό ο Μιραλάς!|work=Contra.gr|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Kevin Mirallas vs DaMarcus Beasley USA vs. Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Mirallas in action against [[DaMarcus Beasley]] during an [[Exhibition match|international friendly]] against the [[United States national men's soccer team|United States]] on 29 May 2013]]
Mirallas has represented Belgium at [[Belgium national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Belgium national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21]] level, and was one of the leading figures in guiding the [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21s]] to the semi-finals of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]].

He scored twice in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] football tournament, once against China (2–0 victory) and once against Italy (3–2 victory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sports Reference|title=Kevin Mirallas Biography and Statistics|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mi/kevin-mirallas-1.html|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his full international debut for the [[Belgium national football team|senior team]] in 2007 and scored his first ever international goal against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in Brussels on 23 August of that year, as a [[Mousa Dembélé (footballer, born 1987)|Mousa Dembélé]] brace helped the Red Devils to a 3–2 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/matches/round=2241/match=83783/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Dembélé double downs Serbia |publisher=UEFA |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirallas was part of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], making his tournament debut in the second group match, a 1–0 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]], as a 75th-minute substitute for [[Dries Mertens]]. In a game of few opportunities, Mirallas hit the post with Belgium's first shot on target, with another substitute [[Divock Origi]] scoring the only goal two minutes from full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chase|first1=Graham|title=Belgium 1–0 Russia|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285242|accessdate=22 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was left out of Belgium’s preliminary [[Belgium national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: Belgium announce initial 28-man squad for Russia| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/belgium-world-cup-squad-confirmed-russia-2018-nainggolan-hazard-de-bruyne-lukaku-a8361241.html%3Famp 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2016}}
Mirallas was deployed as a centre forward for Olympiacos but since his move to Everton he has been deployed mainly as a winger or a free roaming forward. He is known for his pace, close ball control, passing ability and proficiency in one-on-one situations.

==Personal life==
Mirallas' father was born in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/en/learn-english/kevin-mirallas-player-profile|title=Premier Skills English|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521215542/http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/en/learn-english/kevin-mirallas-player-profile|archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(football)|Galatasaray]], on [[loan (sports)|loan]] from [[Premier League]] club [[Everton FC|Everton]], and the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria national team]].

==Club career==
===Eupen===
Onyekuru began his football career with the [[Aspire Academy]] in 2010, and graduated in 2015 joining their partner club, [[K.A.S. Eupen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pageone.ng/2017/01/05/henry-onyekuru-national-stardom/|title=Henry Onyekuru - From National Stadium to Stardom - PageOne.ng|first=|last=PageOne|date=5 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Eupen on 5 September 2015 in a 2–2 tie against [[K.F.C. Dessel Sport]] in the [[Belgian Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/09/05/belgium/second-division/kfc-dessel-sport/koninklijke-as-eupen/2062227/|title=Dessel Sport vs. AS Eupen - 5 september 2015 - Soccerway|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onyekuru helped the team get promoted to the [[Belgian First Division A]] in his debut season, and made his professional debut in a 3–0 loss on 30 July 2016 against [[S.V. Zulte Waregem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/07/30/belgium/pro-league/sv-zulte-waregem/koninklijke-as-eupen/2239201/|title=Zulte-Waregem vs. AS Eupen - 30 juli 2016 - Soccerway|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful season in the Belgium first division, Onyekuru finished as one of the top scorers in the league, catching the attention of various larger teams in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/3046335/celtic-and-rb-leipzig-eye-nigerian-henry-onyekuru-sources|title=Celtic, RB Leipzig eyeing KAS Eupen's Henry Onyekuru - Sources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 2016–17 season as joint top-scorer with 22 goals, but the trophy was handed to [[Łukasz Teodorczyk]] as he scored more away goals than Onyekuru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Łukasz Teodorczyk królem strzelców|url=http://www.90minut.pl/news/277/news2777126-Lukasz-Teodorczyk-krolem-strzelcow.html|website=www.90minut.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
On 30 June 2017, Onyekuru joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for £7 million and was immediately sent on loan to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Onyekuru: Everton sign Nigeria striker and loan him to Anderlecht|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40418808|website=BBC Sport|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onyekuru had been handed the number 9 jersey at Anderlecht for the 2017–18 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/incoming-everton-striker-onyekuru-handed-13250176|title=Incoming Everton striker Onyekuru handed new squad number|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=12 July 2017|publisher=LiverpoolEcho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having scored 10 goals in 28 matches for Anderlecht, Onyekuru suffered a knee ligament injury in December which would require surgery. Anderlecht announced surgery would be necessary and that he would be out of action "for several months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton Youngster Onyekuru Set for 8-Month Spell on Sidelines With Knee Injury|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2017/12/29/everton-youngster-onyekuru-set-8-month-spell-sidelines-knee-injury|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=Sports Illustrated|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, it was reported that Onyekuru would return to Anderlecht after rehabilitation and full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Onyekuru returns to Anderlecht after recovery from Injury|url=https://guardian.ng/sport/onyekuru-returns-to-anderlecht-after-recovery-from-injury/|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=The Guardian (Nigeria)|date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Onyekuru joined [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Henry Onyekuru: Everton striker joins Galatasaray on loan |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44805994 |accessdate=12 July 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan fee paid to Everton was reported as £700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everton's Henry Onyekuru joins Galatasaray on season-long loan |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11434839/evertons-henry-onyekuru-joins-galatasaray-on-season-long-loan |website=Sky Sports |accessdate=12 July 2018 |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
