Jordan Pickford

Jordan Lee Pickford ("né" Logan; born 7 March 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Everton and the England national team.

Pickford has previously played for Sunderland's academy, reserve, and senior teams in addition to loan spells at Darlington, Alfreton Town, Burton Albion, Carlisle United, Bradford City and Preston North End. He signed for Everton for a fee of £25 million in June 2017.

Pickford has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels. He received his first call-up from the full England national team for the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Slovenia in October 2016, making his debut in November 2017 in a friendly against Germany. He was the starting goalkeeper in England’s 2018 World Cup fourth-place finish, leading the squad to its first semi-final appearance since 1990 with a penalty shootout victory in the second round and a clean sheet in the quarter-final.

Pickford was born in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and attended St Robert of Newminster Catholic School.

Pickford joined Sunderland's Academy at the age of eight and progressed through the age groups before signing two-year scholarship terms in 2010. The following year, Pickford was promoted from the Academy to the reserve team.

In 2011, Pickford signed his first professional contract with the club. The following year, Pickford signed a contract extension with the club.

Pickford signed on loan for Conference Premier club Darlington in time to make his debut against Fleetwood Town on 21 January 2012, playing the whole of a 1–0 home loss. The initial month-long loan was subsequently extended until the end of April. Pickford went on to make seventeen appearances for Darlington, who were relegated.

On 25 February 2013, Pickford signed for Conference Premier club Alfreton Town, again on an initial month-long loan and was a cover for Phil Barnes, who was injured. He made his debut the next day in a 5–1 win over Hyde United. His loan spell at the club was subsequently extended until the end of the season. During this spell, Pickford kept five clean sheets in twelve matches.

On 2 August 2013, Pickford signed another loan deal, this time with League Two club Burton Albion, and made his debut the next day against Cheltenham Town. However, his loan ended on 17 August, after Sunderland recalled him with Pickford featuring just three times for Burton. On 13 September, Pickford re-joined Burton on loan. His handful of first-team appearances at Burton Albion led to an extension of his loan spell for another month. After making 12 appearances across his two loan spells, Pickford was recalled by his parent club once again. He subsequently spent 11 matches as an unused substitute on the bench as a cover for Vito Mannone between 23 November 2013 and 18 January 2014.

Although it was rumoured that he could return on loan to Burton for the third time, Pickford joined League One club Carlisle United on a one-month loan on 8 February 2014. He made his debut that same day in a 2–1 loss away to Gillingham. His form and handful of first-team appearances led the club to keep him on loan for the rest of the season. After extending his loan at the club, Pickford went on to make 18 appearances for Carlisle.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Pickford signed a four-year contract with Sunderland, keeping him at the club until 2018.

On 21 July 2014, Pickford joined League One club Bradford City on a season-long loan for the 2014–15 season. He made his debut on 9 August in a 3–2 win against Coventry City at Valley Parade, and kept his first clean sheet in the following match, a 0–0 draw away to Walsall. Pickford then received his first ever red card after he was sent off in the 11th minute of a 2–1 loss to Rochdale on 10 January 2015. He served a one-match suspension which his club did not appeal.

On 7 February, he was once again expelled from play as he was sent off in the last minute of a 2–2 away draw against Port Vale. After being given a two-match ban, the club successfully appealed and had it revoked.

Pickford established himself as a first-choice goalkeeper for most of the season until he was recalled by his parent club on 9 March 2015.

On 31 July 2015, Pickford joined Championship club Preston North End on a season-long loan for the 2015–16 season. He kept a clean sheet on his debut in a 0–0 draw against Middlesbrough at Deepdale.

Further clean sheets in a 1–0 win against Milton Keynes Dons in his second league appearance and a 0–0 draw with Rotherham United on 18 August made it three clean sheets from his first three league appearances for the club. On 25 August, Pickford kept another clean sheet as Preston defeated Premier League team Watford 1–0 in the League Cup. On 7 November, he recorded a 6th consecutive clean sheet in a 0–0 draw against QPR, equalling the club record. During his stint at Preston, Pickford impressed his veteran goalkeeping teammate Chris Kirkland, who said "Jordan comes out to take crosses and has an authority for someone still very young... As for his kicking, that is brilliant! I have never seen anyone kick a ball like he does." On 20 December 2015, Pickford was controversially sent off in a 1–0 defeat against Leeds United: he rushed out of his box to challenge striker Chris Wood, and was judged to have handled the ball. Preston successfully appealed the decision, using replay footage that showed the ball hitting his chest.

On 1 January 2016, Pickford was recalled by Sunderland, with the side struggling in 19th place in the Premier League. He made his first-team debut on 9 January 2016, in a 3–1 FA Cup loss to Arsenal. He made his Premier League debut against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 16 January 2016 losing 4–1, meaning he had played in the top five leagues of English football by the age of 21. On 26 January, Pickford signed a new contract committing his future to Sunderland until 2020.

Pickford began the 2016–17 season as understudy to Vito Mannone. However, after Mannone suffered a serious arm injury in training, Pickford started Sunderland's third league match of the season, away to Southampton. He produced several saves during the match, but in the 85th minute he made an error which allowed Jay Rodriguez to equalise for the hosts in a 1–1 draw. On 13 April 2017, Pickford was named as one of six players shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

On 15 June 2017, Pickford signed for Premier League club Everton on a five-year contract. The initial fee of £25 million, with the possibility of rising to £30 million in add-ons, made him the third most expensive goalkeeper in history, the most expensive British goalkeeper of all time and will make him Everton's second most expensive signing, pending add-on payments, as Gylfi Sigurðsson is currently the club's most expensive signing with £40 million plus add-on payments. Pickford made his league debut for Everton on 12 August 2017, when his club beat Stoke City 1–0 at Goodison Park. At the conclusion of his first season, he was named Everton's Player of the Season, along with numerous other club accolades.

On 2 December in the Merseyside Derby against local rivals Liverpool, Pickford made a last-minute mistake after he mishandled a volley from Virgil van Dijk, allowing Divock Origi to score the winning goal for Liverpool from a close-range header in the 96th minute.

Pickford has represented the England international team at every level from under-16s to under-21s. In October 2009, he made his England U16 debut against Wales U16. In 2011, Pickford represented England at the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup. In a game versus Canada, Pickford allowed an 86th-minute goal, from a downfield kick by Canadian goalkeeper Quillan Roberts which tied the game in a 2–2 draw, which remains as the only goal scored by a goalkeeper in a FIFA finals to date from open play.

On 25 August 2015, he was called up to the England under-21 squad for the first time. Pickford made his debut for the under-21s in a friendly against the United States under-23s at Deepdale on 3 September 2015.

On 14 October, Pickford assisted Nathan Redmond's goal in the England U21s' 3–0 victory over Kazakhstan at the Ricoh Arena with a long range pass from his own penalty area. His team won the 2016 Toulon Tournament, their first in 22 years.

On 9 October 2016, Pickford received his first call-up to the senior squad, replacing an injured Tom Heaton for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovenia.

Pickford led the England under-21 to the semi-final of the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in June 2017 with a string of strong performances.

On 24 August 2017, Pickford was called up to the England squad by manager Gareth Southgate for two 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. However, he later withdrew from the squad due to injury. Pickford made his debut in a friendly on 10 November 2017, starting as England drew 0–0 with Germany at Wembley Stadium.

Pickford was named in the 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He started the opening match against Tunisia, which England won 2–1. In their round of 16 match on 3 July, Pickford helped England beat Colombia 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, saving from Carlos Bacca, to claim his nation's first World Cup penalty shoot-out victory and a place in the quarter-final.

On 7 July 2018, Pickford kept his first clean sheet of the World Cup and was named man of the match, as England knocked out Sweden with a 2–0 win in the quarter-finals. The result earned England a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.

Leighton Baines

Leighton John Baines (born 11 December 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back for club Everton, where he is also vice-captain, and the England national team.

Baines started his career with Wigan Athletic, and was part of the team that won the Second Division in the 2002–03 season and was a runner-up in the 2004–05 Championship and the 2006 League Cup Final. He joined Everton in 2007, helping them reach the 2009 FA Cup Final. He has played for England at under-21 and senior levels. Baines was included in the England squads at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Baines made his debut for Wigan Athletic in 2002, and was a member of the team that won the Second Division in the 2002–03 season. He was a regular in the first team when Wigan earned promotion to the Premier League in 2004–05. That season saw Baines score his first goal for the club, a long-range shot against Ipswich Town.

When he secured promotion with Wigan, he doubted he was good enough to play in the Premier League: "We won promotion to the Premier League and, straight away, I was thinking, 'Where am I going to go now?' I should have been celebrating but I spent a large part of that summer worrying about what it would be like spending the next year on the bench and in the reserves."

Baines signed a new contract with Wigan in February 2005 despite being linked to a number of Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton, and extended his contract again after impressive displays in his first season in the Premier League. Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 League Cup Final defeat to Manchester United.

In July 2007, Baines rejected a move to Sunderland, after their bid of a reported £6 million was accepted by Wigan. In the following month he signed for Everton for an initial fee of £5 million, with another £1 million in add-ons, dependent on Baines's appearances for Everton.

Baines did not play regularly in his first season, making just 29 appearances in all competitions, due to an injury and the good form of Phil Jagielka and Joseph Yobo at centre back which kept Joleon Lescott at left back. His second season at Everton saw an increase in Baines's playing time. Due to an injury to Yobo, Lescott moved to the centre of defence and Baines played at left back. He was voted Player of the Month at Everton two months in a row in the 2008–09 season. Baines scored his first ever Everton goal against Portsmouth on 21 March, at Fratton Park, after 57 matches (in all competitions) without scoring. On 30 August 2009, he scored a last minute penalty in a 2–1 win over his former team Wigan. A month later, he captained Everton for the first time in a UEFA Europa League match against AEK Athens.

In the 2010–11 season, Baines played every minute of Everton's Premier League matches, as well as scoring seven goals in all competitions. His contribution was rewarded with the club's Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season, and Goal of the Season awards. His goal against Chelsea, scored from direct free kick, was voted Everton Goal of the Season. He also contributed 11 assists throughout the season, 5th overall in the league, and was the league's highest assisting defender.

Baines scored five times during 2011–12, four of which were penalties. He reached 99 consecutive league matches before ending his season early due to injury. His performance at left back was deemed impressive enough to be named in the PFA's Premier League Team of the Year in 2012, the first Everton player to do so for 22 years since Neville Southall in 1989–90.

During the 2012–13 season, Baines created 116 chances for his teammates, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. When 2013's PFA Premier League Team of the Year was announced, Baines was again included, and he also won Everton's Player of the Season and Players' Player of the Season awards. Baines was the only outfield player to have played in every minute of every Premier League match during the season. He was the subject of multiple bids during the 2013 summer transfer window from Manchester United but all were rejected by Everton.

Baines scored two free-kicks either side of goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen from the same position as Everton beat West Ham United 3–2 in September. He was only the fifth player since 2006–07 to score two direct free-kicks in one Premier League match (after Rooney, Ronaldo, Drogba and Larsson). Baines suffered a toe injury in November which saw him miss a top flight fixture for the first time in 52 matches. On 27 January 2014, Baines signed a four-year deal to extend his contract at Everton. He scored three penalties during the season to take his career tally to 13, becoming the first player in Premier League history to have taken more than 10 and never missed one. The 13th came on his 300th appearance in the competition in a 2–0 win over Manchester United. Baines scored five goals and assisted four others during 2013–14, the most of any defender in the league.

He scored his first ever goal in European football for Everton on 18 September 2014, netting from the penalty spot in a 4–1 win over Wolfsburg in the first match of their UEFA Europa League campaign. On 5 October 2014, his penalty against Manchester United was saved by David de Gea. This was the first time he did not score from a penalty in the Premier League. In January 2015, Baines made his 45th assist in the Premier League to overtake Graeme Le Saux as the defender with the most in the division's history. Baines missed the beginning of 2015–16 after injuring his ankle in training just before the Premier League started. Baines became the third defender to score 30 Premier League goals after John Terry (40) and David Unsworth (38) when he scored for Everton in a 3–0 win against Southampton on 2 January 2017. Baines became the first defender to reach 50 Premier League assists on 15 April 2017. Everton manager Ronald Koeman had reiterated Baines is Everton's first-choice penalty taker after he equalled the club's spot-kick record.

Baines scored the winner for Everton in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round first leg against Slovakian side Ružomberok on 27 July 2017. By scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win over Watford on 5 November 2017, Baines became Everton's leading Premier League penalty scorer.

Baines made his debut for the England under-21s in a 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification away to Austria in September 2004 under Peter Taylor.

In the following campaign Baines scored a vital goal for the England under-21 team against Germany on 6 October 2006, securing a 1–0 win in the first leg of a UEFA European U21 Championship play-off. He played all four of England's matches in the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship finals. In total he played 16 times for the under-21 team and scored one goal.

With Wayne Bridge retiring from international duties, Baines was called up to the senior England squad for the first time in March 2009, and made his full international debut in a friendly against Egypt at Wembley Stadium on 3 March 2010, playing the full 90 minutes of a 3–1 win for England. He was selected in a provisional squad of 30 players for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final squad of 23 players to be taken to South Africa, with Aston Villa left back Stephen Warnock, who had not played in the warm-up matches, taken in his place. Baines made his competitive international debut on 4 June 2011, replacing the injured Ashley Cole in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland, assisting Ashley Young for England's equalising goal.

Baines was named in Roy Hodgson's squad for Euro 2012 in May, but did not feature in the tournament with Hodgson using Ashley Cole for all four of England's matches.

In September 2012, he scored his first international goal against Moldova in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match, a deflected free kick which was the last of England's goals in a 5–0 win.

On 30 May 2014, Baines' corners in a Wembley friendly against Peru led to two of England's goals in a 3–0 win.

He played full in England's first two matches in the 2014 FIFA World Cup (against Italy and Uruguay), both ended in 1–2 defeats as the team was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup for the first time since 1958.

Baines is described in his UEFA.com profile as a "dependable left back" who is "best known for his set-piece expertise and penalties". But in his early years, Baines played in midfield and attack; it was only when he started at Wigan that he began to play in the left back position. Roberto Martínez had planned to redeploy Baines as a midfielder, in a similar change to Philipp Lahm. Baines has stated that he would be "excited to give it a go".

Baines is the current record holder of the most assists as a defender in the Premier League.

Baines was born and raised in Kirkby, Merseyside and was educated at St Joseph The Worker Catholic Primary School and All Saints' RC High School in Kirkby. He began playing football at a local Liverpool primary school but, age 10, had trouble playing for a Sunday League team because he was shy. He has three children with his wife, Rachel. Baines is a close friend of musician Miles Kane, and is himself a keen guitarist.

Kurt Zouma

Kurt Happy Zouma (born 27 October 1994) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Everton, on loan from fellow Premier League club Chelsea, and the France national team.

Zouma began his career at Saint-Étienne, making his professional debut aged 16. Zouma won the Coupe de la Ligue with the club in 2013, and joined Chelsea for £12 million in January 2014. Chelsea loaned him back to his first club for the remainder of the season, and in his first full campaign in England, Zouma helped Chelsea win the League Cup and the Premier League. In July 2017 Zouma joined Stoke City on loan for the 2017–18 season.

Zouma represented France at youth levels, up to under-21. He made his senior international debut against Denmark on 29 March 2015.

Born in Lyon, Zouma began his career at age nine with Vaulx-en-Velin until he was 15. He played as a right winger and also as a striker before switching to his current position of a defender.

Zouma joined Saint-Étienne in 2009. On 2 April 2011, he signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal. He was subsequently promoted to the senior team by manager Christophe Galtier ahead of the 2011–12 season, and initially played without a name on his shirt in order to protect him from media attention.

Zouma made his professional debut at 16 years old, on 31 August 2011 in a Coupe de la Ligue match against Bordeaux, playing the entire match in a 3–1 win. On 17 September, he made his Ligue 1 debut in a 3–0 loss at Lorient; his first professional goal came on 19 November, replacing Paulão after nine minutes and finishing a corner kick to confirm a 2–0 win before half time at OGC Nice. He totalled 21 league games in his first season – 13 starts – and his other goal came on 14 January 2012, heading Banel Nicolita's corner for the only goal against lowly Sochaux at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

On 20 April 2013, Zouma played in Saint-Étienne's 1–0 win over Rennes in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue. Eight days later in the Derby du Rhone away to Lyon, he opened a 1–1 draw by heading Yohan Mollo's corner after half an hour of play. On 7 November 2013, Zouma was banned for ten games following a challenge that left Sochaux's Thomas Guerbert with a broken right leg and a dislocated ankle.

On 31 January 2014, Zouma joined Chelsea on a five-and-a-half-year contract for a fee believed to be around £12 million (€14.6 million). He remained at Saint-Étienne on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season.

Zouma first appeared as a first-half substitute for Chelsea in a pre-season friendly against Wycombe Wanderers. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 friendly win against Slovene club Olimpija, on 27 July 2014. He was given the number 5 shirt, previously worn by Michael Essien.

On 24 September, Zouma made his first competitive appearance for Chelsea, scoring the opener in a 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers in the third round of the League Cup. He made his second Chelsea start and first UEFA Champions League appearance on 21 October against Maribor, helping his side keep a clean sheet in a 6–0 win. He made his Premier League debut as an added-time substitute for Willian in the 1–1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford on 26 October 2014.

On 4 January 2015, Zouma scored the third goal for Chelsea in the 3–0 victory over Watford in the FA Cup. Six days later, he started in the Premier League for the first time, partnering John Terry in place of Gary Cahill and keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 home win over Newcastle United, which put Chelsea back into first place in the league table. With Nemanja Matić suspended and John Obi Mikel injured, Zouma played in defensive midfield as Chelsea won the League Cup Final on 1 March after a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. On 3 May, he featured as a substitute for the final five minutes in place of Willian as Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace 1–0 to win the league title.

On 2 August 2015, Zouma was a 69th-minute substitute for César Azpilicueta as Chelsea lost 1–0 to rivals Arsenal in the Community Shield. Starting ahead of John Terry, he scored his first Premier League goal on 19 September, heading in Cesc Fàbregas' cross to open a 2–0 home win over the same opposition. On 24 November, as a late substitute for the injured Terry, he scored his first European goal to conclude a 4–0 win at Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League group stage.

Under interim manager Guus Hiddink, Zouma regularly started alongside Terry as Chelsea's form improved. On 7 February 2016, Zouma ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee after landing awkwardly from a jump in a match against Manchester United. He required surgery and was ruled out for six months.

In the summer of 2016, Zouma traveled and trained with the first-team during preseason. Chelsea also rejected a loan offer from Schalke 04. On 24 October, Zouma made his first competitive appearance after being out of action for nine months, playing 45 minutes for the Chelsea under-23 side in a 2–2 draw against Derby County. On 8 January 2017, Zouma made his first team comeback in Chelsea's 4–1 FA Cup third-round win over Peterborough United. On 4 February, he made his first appearance of the 2016–17 Premier League season as a substitute in a 3–1 win against rivals Arsenal.

Following agreeing to a new six-year deal with Chelsea, on 21 July 2017, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side Stoke City on loan for the 2017–18 season. On 12 August, he made his debut in a 1–0 loss at Everton.

In November 2017, Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross expressed his surprise that Chelsea had loaned out Zouma, who had only missed one match, against his parent club. On 20 November he headed his first goal for the Potters, in a 2–2 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion. Zouma played 37 matches for Stoke in 2017–18 as the club suffered relegation to the EFL Championship.

On 10 August 2018, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side Everton on loan for the 2018–19 season. He made his debut on 25 August as a last-minute substitute for the injured Michael Keane in a 2–2 draw at Bournemouth.

Zouma scored his first goal for Everton on 13 January 2019, a header to open a 2–0 home win also against Bournemouth. He was sent off for dissent after the final whistle in a 1–0 loss at Watford on 9 February.

Zouma is a France youth international having represented his nation at under-16 and under-17 level. He played with the under-17 team at the 2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Zouma has been the captain for the French under-21 side. He was part of the under-20 team that won the 2013 World Cup in Turkey. In the quarter-finals against Uzbekistan in Rize, he headed the last goal of a 4–0 victory.

Senior France manager Didier Deschamps wanted to build a defence around Zouma and fellow youngster Raphaël Varane, and on 19 March 2015, he was called him up for the first time for friendlies against Brazil and Denmark. He made his debut in the latter match ten days later, a 2–0 win at his former club ground with Saint-Étienne, the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, replacing Morgan Schneiderlin for the last eight minutes of the game. After his injury for Chelsea in February, Zouma missed France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016.

He returned to the squad in August 2017, replacing the injured Raphaël Varane for a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands. He was put on standby for France's squad at the final tournament in Russia. Zouma earned his first France cap in over three years on 11 October 2018 as a substitute in a 2–2 friendly draw with Iceland, coming on as a substitute and winning the equalising penalty.

A November 2013 report by "FourFourTwo" noted Zouma's strength, reading of the game, and aerial presence, while mentioning his occasional lapses in concentration. In January 2014, Zouma was named by British newspaper "The Observer" as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. The newspaper wrote, "Blessed with exceptional power and technique, Zouma is also coveted by many for his leadership qualities."

"Match of the Day" pundit, Danny Murphy linked Zouma to Marcel Desailly, another Frenchman who played in defence for Chelsea. Writing after a draw with Manchester City, which included a strong run and perfectly-executed sliding tackle on Sergio Agüero, Murphy noted Zouma's reliability and confidence against the strong opponent, in addition to his pace. He predicted that Zouma could be a Chelsea mainstay for years to come, and would be an ideal replacement for captain John Terry, then aged 34.

Shawcross called Zouma the "ultimate defender" for his speed, jump, passing, shooting and tackling, and said that Tottenham Hotspur's Toby Alderweireld was the only central defender on his level.

Zouma's parents emigrated to France from the Central African Republic. His older brother Lionel plays in the same position for French club Bourg-en Bresse. Zouma is named after Kurt Sloane, Jean-Claude Van Damme's character in the 1989 film "Kickboxer", while his middle name Happy reflects an African tradition of using positive words as middle names. Zouma is married to Sandra, with whom he has two children.

Phil Jagielka

Philip Nikodem Jagielka ( or ; born 17 August 1982) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for club Everton and the English national team. Jagielka is also the captain of Everton.

Jagielka started his career with Sheffield United in 2000, where he played mainly as a central midfielder. He helped them achieve top-flight status for the 2006–07 season, after which he joined Everton for a £4 million fee.

He has received 40 England caps since his debut in 2008 and was included in the England squads at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Jagielka was born in Manchester and attended Knutsford Academy. He played for Holy Family Football Club, a Sunday team affiliated with, although not directly linked to, the school of the same name, from the ages of eight to 11. He played as a right winger, as he possessed great pace, and even played in matches against boys of the school year older than him. However, he first impressed youth scouts whilst playing for his local team Hale Barns United in Altrincham. He predominantly played midfield during his time with the club. He also played for his school team, Moorlands Junior School, playing any position including in goal and with boys 2 school years above him. He was at the academy of Everton as a youngster and spent time training with clubs such as Stoke City, and Manchester City, before joining Sheffield United in 1998 at 15 years of age.

Jagielka made his way through the youth ranks at Sheffield United before making his first-team debut on 5 May 2000 against Swindon Town in the final First Division match of the 1999–2000 season, whilst still a trainee. He was rewarded with a professional contract the following day and having progressed well at the start of the following season, he signed a three-year deal with the club in January 2001.

He established himself in the Sheffield United first-team in the 2002–03 season and started to attract the attention of other clubs, including Leeds United, who were linked with a £6 million joint bid for Jagielka and United teammate Michael Brown, but Sheffield United said they would resist any attempts to sign the players.

Jagielka stated in April 2005 he was happy to stay at United, despite several Premier League clubs being interested in signing him. United manager Neil Warnock told West Ham United in June 2005 that Jagielka would not be sold, and in July Wigan Athletic made a £4 million bid for Jagielka, after which United upped their valuation of him. By November, Jagielka had been linked with a £4 million move to Bolton Wanderers, but United manager Neil Warnock said there had been no contact from Bolton.

Jagielka signed a new three-year deal with United in August 2006. He played as team captain in Chris Morgan's absence. Jagielka gave United their first Premier League victory since April 1994 when he hit a 91st minute half-volley against Middlesbrough for a 2–1 win in September 2006. Despite being recognised as one of United's key players, chairman Kevin McCabe admitted that Jagielka could be sold if the price was high enough. In a home match against Arsenal on 30 December 2006, due to a thigh injury to starting goalkeeper Paddy Kenny and with his team 1–0 up, Jagielka was forced to play in goal for the remainder of the match. Arsenal were kept at bay for the remaining 34 minutes and Jagielka's late save from Robin van Persie secured the 1–0 victory. His ability to deputise in goal meant that Neil Warnock was able to – and usually did – do without a substitute goalkeeper on the bench in order to give himself more tactical options (League rules then limited the number of substitutes to 5).

By the end of the 2006–07 season, he had made 133 consecutive league appearances for United, including every league match in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons and every minute of the 2006–07 season. When Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2006–07 season, Jagielka was linked with moves away from United and goalkeeper Paddy Kenny said he believed it was time Jagielka moved on. New United boss Bryan Robson urged Jagielka to wait for the outcome of the club's relegation arbitration hearing before deciding to leave the club.

Jagielka eventually signed for Everton on 4 July 2007, in a deal worth £4 million on a five-year contract, the highest amount ever paid for a Sheffield United player. He made his home debut at Goodison Park on 31 July 2007 as a second-half substitute in a pre-season friendly against Werder Bremen, replacing Joseph Yobo in central defence. After a slow start to his Everton career, Jagielka developed into an important member of the first team. He scored his first Everton goal in the UEFA Cup against AZ Alkmaar. He scored an own goal against Wigan Athletic, although Everton won 2–1. He put in a succession of man of the match performances in the following matches, against Tottenham Hotspur, Brann and Manchester City. He scored his first league goal for Everton against Reading on 9 February 2008.

Jagielka started the 2008–09 season as first-choice centre back, playing every minute of every league match until being injured in a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester City. He was named the Premier League Player of the Month for February and won Everton's fans and club player of the season. Jagielka scored the winning penalty for Everton in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final of the FA Cup against Manchester United, but he was claimed to have fouled Danny Welbeck after 68 minutes, with many claiming it to be a penalty, which the referee did not award. Soon afterwards he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament playing against Manchester City, and as a consequence missed the 2009 FA Cup Final, which Everton lost to Chelsea.

After missing the end of the 2008–09 season and more than half of 2009–10, Jagielka played his first senior fixture since the cruciate ligament injury in an away match against Sporting CP in the UEFA Europa League in February 2010, coming on as a substitute for an injured Philippe Senderos.

On 3 January 2013, Jagielka signed a new contract at Everton, keeping him at Goodison Park until 2017. In April 2013, manager David Moyes announced that Jagielka would be appointed as the club captain for the 2013–14 season after the retirement of Phil Neville.

When Moyes left for Manchester United, new manager Roberto Martínez stated that Jagielka would make a "phenomenal captain". In Jagielka's first season as captain, Everton amassed a Premier League club record 72 points to finish fifth with him being awarded three accolades at the club: Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season and Goal of the Season.

On 27 September 2014, Jagielka scored his first goal in two seasons with a 30-yard half volley against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby to level the match in the 91st minute. On 6 November 2014, Jagielka scored his first European goal in seven years in Everton's 3–0 UEFA Europa League group stage win against Lille.

Jagielka reclaimed his place as Everton's starting centre back in March 2017 after Ramiro Funes Mori suffered a knee injury on international duty. In April 2017, Jagielka scored in three successive league matches for Everton: first, in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 4 April – his first league goal in two years – then in a 4–2 victory against Leicester City at Goodison Park on 9 April, and finally, in a 3–1 home victory over Burnley on 15 April.

Jagielka extended his contract with Everton for another year until the summer of 2019 on 2 August 2017.

Jagielka is a former member of the England under-21 team, and scored in a 2–0 victory over Slovakia at the Stadium of Light in June 2003.

On 10 May 2007, Jagielka was named in the England B team for the first time, for their match against Albania. Starting on the bench, he replaced Phil Neville at right back at the beginning of the second half. On 11 May 2008, Jagielka was named in the senior England squad for the first time for the friendlies with United States and Trinidad and Tobago. He subsequently expressed his delight at the call up and publicly thanked everyone at Everton for their help. On 1 June 2008, Jagielka got his first international cap for the senior team against Trinidad and Tobago, playing the second half of a match in which England used two different sides for each half.

Jagielka was once again named in the England squad for the friendly match against European champions Spain, 11 February 2009, and subsequently played for the first 45 minutes, after an impressive string of performances at club level publicly praised by manager David Moyes after the FA Cup fourth round replay tie between Everton and Liverpool. Jagielka received his fourth cap when he played in England's first post 2010 FIFA World Cup friendly against Hungary on 11 August 2010 at Wembley Stadium where he scored an own goal to put the visitors ahead in a 2–1 England win.

On 3 September 2010, Jagielka made his first competitive start, and played for the entirety of the match in a 4–0 win over Bulgaria. He was said to have "read the game brilliantly on a night when he proved his credentials". He was called up to the England squad once again for the Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley Stadium on 12 October. He was called up again for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier and friendly against Wales and Ghana on 26 March and came on in the 88th minute for Scott Parker. On 12 November, he started as centre-half in a friendly against Spain and gave an exceptional performance as England ground their way to a 1–0 win.

Jagielka was originally placed on the standby list for England's UEFA Euro 2012 squad, and played the full match in a pre-tournament warm-up match against Norway, which England won 1–0. However, on 28 May 2012, Jagielka was added to the main squad after Gareth Barry was ruled out of the tournament with an abdominal injury. Jagielka did not feature in any of England's four matches during the tournament.

In August 2012, Jagielka scored his first goal for England, a diving header during a 2–1 friendly victory over Italy in Bern, Switzerland.

On 12 May 2014, Jagielka was named in England's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He scored his second England goal on 30 May 2014 to wrap up a 3–0 friendly win over Peru at Wembley, reacting after goalkeeper Raúl Fernández dropped a corner from Jagielka's Everton teammate Leighton Baines. England were unbeaten in 11 competitive matches in which Jagielka has played in (won eight and drawn three), until they lost 2–1 to Italy in their opening match of the World Cup.

Jagielka scored his third England goal, and first in a competitive fixture, on 9 October 2014; his header opened a 5–0 Wembley win over San Marino in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. Jagielka became the first Everton player to captain England when they played against Lithuania on 12 October 2015 in a UEFA Euro qualifying match.

On 15 November 2016, he became the most capped Everton player by England when he came on as a second-half substitute against Spain in a 2–2 draw.

Jagielka is of Polish and Scottish descent. His older brother Stephen Jagielka was also a professional midfielder, mainly for Shrewsbury Town. Although he was loaned to Sheffield United for one season, the pair never featured together in a competitive fixture. He also has two sisters, Barbara and Nicola.

André Gomes

André Filipe Tavares Gomes (; born 30 July 1993) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for English club Everton, on loan from Barcelona, and the Portugal national team.

He played three years at Benfica, where he won the domestic treble in the 2013–14 season. In July 2014 he joined Valencia and, two years later, signed with Barcelona also in the Spanish La Liga.

Gomes earned 37 caps for Portugal all youth levels accounted for, including six for the under-21s. He represented the nation at Euro 2016 – winning the tournament – and the 2017 Confederations Cup.

Born in Grijó, Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto District, Gomes joined S.L. Benfica's youth system at the age of 18, playing his last year as a junior with the Lisbon club. On 28 July 2012 he appeared in his first game with the first team, in a friendly with Gil Vicente, and spent his first season as a senior with the reserve side, competing in the second division.

Gomes scored his first goals with Benfica B in league matches against Braga B (2–2 home draw) and Belenenses (6–0, also at home). On 18 October 2012, he made his official debut with the main squad, playing 25 minutes after coming on as a substitute for Eduardo Salvio and netting in a 4–0 win at Freamunde, for the Taça de Portugal.

Gomes' momentum in Benfica's first team continued on 27 October 2012, as he started and scored in a 3–0 away win over Gil Vicente in his first Primeira Liga appearance. He continued, however, to be mainly associated with the B-team.

On 31 January 2014, Benfica (and Benfica Stars Fund) sold 100% of Gomes' economic rights to a private company, Meriton Capital Limited, for €15 million, plus 25% of a future transfer fee. He remained at the Estádio da Luz until the end of the campaign.

On 16 April 2014, Gomes played the full 90 minutes in the second leg of the semi-finals of the Portuguese Cup, scoring the final 3–1 after a brilliant individual effort to help his team – who played with one man less for 60 minutes against Porto – win the tie 3–2 on aggregate. He ended the season with 23 games all competitions comprised, helping the club win the first treble in its history (league, cup and Taça da Liga).

On 17 July 2014, Gomes agreed to a one-season loan deal with Valencia, joining a host of compatriots including manager Nuno Espírito Santo. Although his economic rights were owned by Peter Lim, a loan deal was arranged to take him and Rodrigo to the Spanish club due to Lim's purchase of the latter.

Gomes made his La Liga debut on 23 August 2014, starting in a 1–1 away draw against Sevilla. He scored his first goal in the competition on 22 September, netting the second of a 3–0 away win over Getafe.

On 12 June 2015, Benfica and Valencia announced they had reached an agreement on Gomes' federative rights. Subsequently, he signed a contract with the Spaniards until 30 June 2020.

On 21 July 2016, Barcelona announced they had reached an agreement with Valencia for the transfer of Gomes, for a fee of €35 million, plus €20 million in add-ons. He made his competitive debut on 17 August, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 home win against Sevilla for the Supercopa de España and being directly involved in two of the goals.

Gomes scored his first goal for the team on 19 March 2017, closing a 4–2 home win against his former club Valencia. He was voted the worst signing of the season by readers of "Marca". In the final of the Copa del Rey, however, he replaced injured Javier Mascherano early into the first half of the match against Alavés, playing mostly as a right back and providing the assist for Neymar who netted the second in an eventual 3–1 triumph.

On 9 August 2018, and even though he was nursing a leg injury sustained during pre-season, Gomes moved to English club Everton on a season-long loan for a fee of €2.25 million. He made his Premier League debut on 21 October, playing 82 minutes in a 2–0 home win over Crystal Palace.

Gomes represented Portugal at the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. At the age of 19 he received his first call-up to the senior team, for a friendly against Ecuador on 6 February 2013, but remained unused in the 2–3 home loss.

Gomes made his full debut on 7 September 2014, starting and playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–1 loss to Albania at the Estádio Municipal de Aveiro for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. He was selected for the squad that appeared in the finals in France, starting in their first game, a 1–1 draw to Iceland in Saint-Étienne where he provided the assist to Nani's goal before being replaced by Eder late into the second half.

Gomes also represented Portugal at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia, playing four times as they finished in third place. He was included in a preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final cut.

Gylfi Sigurðsson

Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson (; alternatively Gylfi Thor Sigurdsson; born 8 September 1989) is an Icelandic professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for club Everton and the Iceland national team.

Gylfi began his professional career with Reading in the Championship and in 2010, was sold to 1899 Hoffenheim, which was Reading's biggest sale. He was voted Player of the Season for two consecutive seasons – for Reading in 2009–10 and for Hoffenheim in 2010–11. After a season back in English football with Swansea City, he joined Tottenham Hotspur for a reported £8 million transfer fee. In 2014, he moved back to Swansea as part of an exchange for Ben Davies.

Gylfi made his senior international debut for Iceland in 2010 and has since earned over 60 caps. He represented Iceland at their first major tournament, UEFA Euro 2016, where his country reached the quarter-finals. He also played at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Born in Reykjavík, Gylfi played for hometown side FH before joining Breiðablik and was an Icelandic under-17 international. He had spent time on trial with Preston North End before signing for Reading on an Academy scholarship on 1 October 2005. He spent three years playing for the youth and reserve teams. Prior to the 2007–08 season, he and five other youngsters were given professional contracts.

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Gylfi was assigned the number 34 shirt for Reading. He was an unused substitute in the club's 2–1 away win at Dagenham & Redbridge in the first round of the League Cup on 12 August. Two weeks later, he made his debut in the next round against Luton Town, entering the match as a 59th-minute substitute for James Harper in a 5–1 win at the Madejski Stadium. He scored in Reading's penalty shoot-out loss away to Stoke City in the third round after entering as a substitute.

To gain first-team experience, Gylfi signed for Shrewsbury Town on a one-month loan spell on 16 October. Two days later, he scored on his league debut against AFC Bournemouth in a 4–1 win at the New Meadow. He made a total of six appearances during his time at Shrewsbury, scoring one goal. He returned to his parent club and featured in Reading's 2–0 loss to Cardiff City in the FA Cup third round on 3 January 2009. On 27 February, he joined Crewe Alexandra on an emergency loan move. Two days later, he made his debut against Brighton away, scoring in the 89th minute in a 4–0 win. On 24 March, his loan was extended until the end of the season. He scored two further goals for Crewe, against Milton Keynes Dons and Cheltenham Town respectively, but could not prevent the club's relegation to League Two.

Gylfi scored his first Reading goal against Burton Albion from 35 yards out in a League Cup first round tie at home on 11 August 2009. He scored his first league goal for Reading in a 3–2 defeat at Peterborough United on 19 September 2009. Gylfi was a major contributor in Reading's extraordinary 2009–10 FA Cup run which included wins over Premier League sides Liverpool, Burnley and West Bromwich Albion. On 13 January 2010, in the third round of the FA Cup against Liverpool, he scored a penalty in injury time to make the score 1–1 and force extra time. Reading went on to win the match 2–1. He scored the winning goal in the 87th minute against Burnley in the fourth round. In the fifth round, he scored the winning goal against West Brom for a 3–2 victory in extra time. In April 2010, Gylfi won the Championship Player of the Month Award for March, edging Peter Løvenkrands of Newcastle United, Graham Dorrans of West Brom and Adel Taarabt of Queens Park Rangers, scoring five goals in six matches that month. On 2 May, Gylfi scored against Preston North End in the final match of the season. Before the match, Gylfi was named as the 2009–10 Reading Player of the Season, surpassing Jimmy Kébé and Ryan Bertrand, who finished second and third respectively.

Gylfi finished the season with 20 goals in 44 matches in all competitions. His performances and his young age prompted several Premier League clubs to enquire over his availability, but he committed his future to Reading when he signed a three-year contract in May 2010.

Gylfi scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the first match of the season when he "skipped past two players before smashing in a 25-yard equaliser" against Scunthorpe United in a 2–1 home loss. He followed this on 28 August with a short-range chip in the 22nd minute away at Leicester City. The evening after the match, the Icelandic media reported Gylfi was to travel to Germany the following Monday to undergo a medical at 1899 Hoffenheim ahead of a transfer. On 31 August, he completed a transfer to 1899 Hoffenheim, with Reading reporting the fee received exceeded their previous club record sale of £6.5 million from the sale of Kevin Doyle.

Gylfi made his debut for 1899 Hoffenheim on 10 September 2010, entering as a substitute with 13 minutes to go in a 2–0 win over Schalke 04. One week later, he scored his first goal for Hoffenheim in a 2–2 draw with 1. FC Kaiserslautern after coming on as a 77th-minute substitute. He scored with his first touch, a 20-yard free-kick that levelled the match. His second goal for the club was another free-kick, from 25 yards out against Mainz 05 in a 4–2 away defeat. He added another two goals to his tally in Hoffenheim's home win against Hannover 96, one of which was from the penalty spot. On 25 May 2011, Gylfi was voted as 1899 Hoffenheim's fans' Player of the Season, despite only starting 13 matches. He finished the season with ten goals and two assists.

During the first half of the 2011–12 season, Gylfi fell out of favour with the club's new manager, making just seven league appearances and was linked with a move away from the club.

On 1 January 2012, it was announced Gylfi would join Premier League club Swansea City on loan for the rest of the season. He made his Premier League debut for Swansea on 15 January, coming on at half-time and setting up the winning goal in a 3–2 win over Arsenal. On 4 February, Gylfi scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against West Bromwich Albion. He also created Swansea's other goal for Danny Graham, taking his tally to three assists in four matches. On 3 March, he scored two goals in a 2–0 victory away at Wigan Athletic, his from a free-kick. Two weeks later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 away win against Fulham. He scored his next goal at White Hart Lane in his team's 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 1 April.

As a result of his fine form, Gylfi was named the Premier League Player of the Month for March, the first Icelander to win the award. His next goal came in a 3–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers that put the club on 42 points for the season.

On 28 May, Swansea agreed a £6.8 million fee with 1899 Hoffenheim for the permanent transfer of Gylfi, subject to him passing a medical. However, following Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers' move to Liverpool, the deal collapsed, despite Huw Jenkins keeping hope in the deal alight. In 18 Premier League matches during his loan spell for Swansea, Gylfi scored seven goals and added four assists.

On 4 July 2012, Gylfi joined Tottenham Hotspur from 1899 Hoffenheim for a reported £8 million transfer fee. He was the first signing for newly appointed Spurs manager André Villas-Boas. On 18 July, he scored his first goal for the club in a friendly against Stevenage after coming on as a second-half substitute. On 26 September, he scored his first competitive goal for the club in a League Cup third round tie away against Carlisle United, closing the scoring in a 3–0 win.

Brian McDermott confirmed Reading made three unsuccessful bids to bring Gylfi back to his former club during the January 2013 transfer window, including a club record offer on deadline day thought by BBC Sport to be around £10 million. On 25 February, Gylfi scored his first Premier League goal for Tottenham, the second goal in a 3–2 win against West Ham United. In the following match, a 2–1 North London derby win against Arsenal, he provided the assist for Gareth Bale.

In the 2013–14 season, Gylfi scored a brace in 2–0 win against Norwich City on 14 September 2013. This win took Spurs up to second in the Premier League table. Gylfi's momentum in the Tottenham team continued on 28 September 2013, as he scored in a 1–1 home draw against Chelsea.

In July 2014, Tottenham announced a deal had been reached with Swansea City for Gylfi to re-join his former club, with Swansea left-back Ben Davies joining Spurs. On the move, Gylfi said, "I really enjoyed my time here last time. I know the club, I know the manager, I know the players and I obviously know the fans and the city as well, so that wasn't that difficult for me." In the opening match of the 2014–15 season, he set up the opener and scored the winning goal as Swansea defeated Manchester United 2–1 at Old Trafford, making this the first time the "Red Devils" have lost their opening home game since 1972. Gylfi continued his good start to his Swansea return with another three assists in his next two matches. In a home match against Arsenal on 9 November 2014, Gylfi curled a free-kick over the wall and into the corner of the net from 25 yards to equalise in an eventual 2–1 win. Gylfi scored in a 4–1 away defeat against Liverpool at Anfield on 29 December.

On 17 January 2015, a wayward pass by Gylfi allowed Chelsea's Oscar to score after 50 seconds in an eventual 5–0 home defeat for Swansea. A week later, he scored and was sent-off in added time at the end of a 3–1 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers in an FA Cup fourth round tie, with Swansea already having been down to ten men after the earlier dismissal of Kyle Bartley.

Amidst rumours of a £25 million move to Everton, Gylfi signed a new four-year contract with Swansea on 2 August 2016. He scored his first goal of the 2016–17 season on 11 September against Chelsea with a second-half penalty in a game which finished 2–2. He ended the season with 9 goals and 13 assists which helped the Swans avoid relegation. In summer 2017, Gylfi refused to participate in Swansea's pre-season tour of the United States, proclaiming he was not in right frame of mind to go with the club because of uncertainty over his future.

On 16 August 2017, Gylfi signed for fellow Premier league side Everton for a reported £40 million transfer fee (with £5 million in potential add-ons), a club-record deal. On 24 August 2017, he scored his first goal for Everton while making his full debut, with a shot from 50 yards in the UEFA Europa League play-off round second leg against Hajduk Split. On 26 November 2017, he scored his first Premier league goal in an Everton shirt against Southampton, but lost the match 1-4. On 2 December 2017, he went on the scoresheet again in a 2-0 defeat to Huddersfield Town. He ended off the 2017-18 season with 6 goals and 5 assists in 31 appearances.

Gylfi started the 2018-19 season with Everton with an assist to Michael Keane in a friendly match against Valencia, while losing the match 2-3. On 29 September 2018, he scored his first brace with the club, a 3-0 victory against Fulham. On 26 December 2018, he assisted and scored a penalty in a 5-1 victory against Burnley.

Gylfi took part in the 2008 U19 European Championship qualifying, scoring twice in qualification and twice in the elite round, but Iceland lost out to group winners Bulgaria by three points and missed out on the finals. In November 2007, Gylfi made his under-21 debut for Iceland, playing 30 minutes against Germany in a 3–0 loss. He made his first appearance in the 2009 European Under-21 Championship qualifying four days later, coming as an extra-time substitute, and played in the remaining matches. In Iceland's last match, he scored the opener against Slovakia, but Slovakia's Miroslav Stoch equalised to make it 1–1. Iceland failed to qualify for the play-offs but made a bright start to the 2011 campaign. He made his campaign debut in October against San Marino, scoring a brace within 16 minutes in a 6–0 thrashing.

In May 2010, Gylfi made his full Iceland debut in a convincing 4–0 win over Andorra and provided the assist for the second goal from a free-kick. Gylfi also helped Iceland's U21 side reach the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, playing in both play-off legs against Scotland as Iceland won 4–2 on aggregate. In the second leg, Gylfi scored two second-half goals to ensure Iceland won the match 2–1.

On 13 October 2014, Gylfi scored both goals (one of which was a penalty) as Iceland defeated the Netherlands in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match. In the reverse fixture the following 3 September at the Amsterdam Arena, he converted another spot-kick for the only goal of the match, after Gregory van der Wiel fouled Birkir Bjarnason.

Gylfi was selected for UEFA Euro 2016. On 18 June, he scored Iceland's goal in their second group stage match against Hungary, a 1–1 draw at the Stade Vélodrome.

In May 2018, Gylfi was named in Iceland's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. During the group stage match against Croatia, he scored a penalty in the 76th minute, although lost the match 1-2, and was knocked out of the tournament.

Theo Walcott

Theo James Walcott (born 16 March 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for club Everton and the English national team.

Walcott is a product of the Southampton Academy and started his career with Southampton before joining Arsenal for £5 million in 2006. His speedy pace and ball crossing led his manager Arsène Wenger to deploy him on the wing for most of his career. Walcott has been played as a striker since the 2012–13 season when he was Arsenal's top scorer, and he has scored more than 100 goals for the club.

On 30 May 2006, Walcott became England's youngest ever senior football player aged 17 years and 75 days. In December, he received the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award. On 6 September 2008, he made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against Andorra, and in the following match against Croatia on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England. He has represented England at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2012 and has 47 caps, scoring eight goals.

Walcott was born to a black British Jamaican father and a white English mother. He grew up as a Liverpool fan due to his father's support of Liverpool. When Chelsea asked him to be a ball boy, he used the opportunity to meet his Liverpool idols:"I was playing in a tournament for Swindon when Southampton and Chelsea showed an interest. Chelsea invited me to be a ball-boy for a match against Liverpool and it was fantastic to meet my heroes Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them. Unfortunately I wasn't born when the team had their golden era, but I enjoyed watching the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman when I was growing up. When Liverpool won the Champions League last year, I went mad. I was shouting so loud I think I woke up the entire village where I live!"

Walcott was born in Stanmore, London, but grew up in Compton, Berkshire. He attended Compton Church of England Primary School and The Downs School, playing football for the local village team and later for Newbury. Walcott scored more than 100 goals in his one and only season for Newbury, before leaving there for Swindon Town. He spent only six months there before leaving for Southampton after he rejected a chance to join Chelsea. Nike agreed to a sponsorship deal with Walcott when he was fourteen years old.

In the 2004–05 season, Walcott starred in the Southampton youth team that reached the final of the against Ipswich Town. In addition, he became the youngest person to play in the Southampton reserve team, at 15 years and 175 days, when he came off the bench against Watford in September 2004. However, he did not play in the Premier League, and Southampton were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2004–05 season.

Before the start of the 2005–06 season, Walcott linked up with the first-team's tour of Scotland, just two weeks after leaving school. He became the youngest-ever player with the Southampton first team, at 16 years and 143 days, after coming on as a substitute in Southampton's 0–0 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Championship.

Walcott made his full first-team debut away to Leeds United on 18 October 2005, and became Southampton's youngest senior goalscorer after 25 minutes of the 2–1 defeat. He scored again away at Millwall four days later, and yet again in his full home debut against Stoke City the following Saturday. His rapid rise to fame also led him to be named amongst the top three finalists for the prestigious BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award on 11 December 2005.

Walcott transferred to Arsenal on 20 January 2006, for a fee of £5 million, rising to £12 million depending on appearances for club and country. The original fee, payable by instalments reported in "The Times" as £5 million down, five increments of £1 million to be paid after each set of ten Premier League appearances, and £2 million in "bonus payments", was revised down to £9.1 million in a compromise settlement agreed in March 2008. Walcott initially joined as a scholar, having agreed to sign a professional contract on his 17th birthday on 16 March 2006. In September 2008, manager Arsène Wenger confirmed that Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Liverpool had all been interested in signing him.

Walcott made his Premier League debut on 19 August 2006, the first day of the 2006–07 season, coming on as a substitute against Aston Villa and setting up a goal for Gilberto Silva. His next appearance was four days later in the Champions League, in the second leg of Arsenal's third qualifying round match against Dinamo Zagreb; he became the youngest ever Arsenal player to appear in European competition, a record since beaten by Jack Wilshere. Within minutes of coming on, Walcott received his first yellow card in Arsenal colours for taking a shot several seconds after the referee had already blown for offside. During stoppage time, his cross beat the Dinamo defence and Mathieu Flamini scored, giving Arsenal a 2–1 win, their first in the new Emirates Stadium, and giving Walcott his second assist in two substitute appearances. His first start came in a home league match against Watford on 14 October 2006. Walcott's exploits with Arsenal and England earned him the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award at the end of 2006.

Walcott's first goal for Arsenal came in the 2007 League Cup Final against Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on 25 February 2007. His 12th-minute strike was overshadowed by events later on in the match: John Terry was knocked unconscious, Didier Drogba scored twice to give Chelsea a 2–1 victory and three players were sent off following a mass brawl. A persistent shoulder injury limited his performance, and Arsène Wenger said that after the injury, he was "he was 50 per cent of what he was before."

Walcott's first home goals of the 2007–08 season were scored in a Champions League match against Slavia Prague, which Arsenal won 7–0; he also set up a goal for Cesc Fàbregas. Walcott scored his first two Premier League goals in a 2–2 draw with Birmingham City at St Andrew's on 23 February 2008. In the Champions League quarter-final on 8 April, Walcott "beat six Liverpool defenders during a magical run from inside his own half before squaring for [Emmanuel] Adebayor to sidefoot home" for a late equaliser, but Liverpool scored twice more to take the match 4–2 and the tie 5–3 on aggregate. A couple of weeks later, Wenger claimed that Walcott had made the shift from boy to man, but was not yet a monster. He finished the season with seven goals in all competitions and four in the league.

For the 2008–09 season, Walcott changed his shirt number from 32 to 14, as previously worn by his idol, Thierry Henry. He had wanted number 8, but that had already been taken by Samir Nasri. He established himself as a first-team regular, starting many matches on the right of midfield or on the wing. On 18 October, Walcott scored his first Premier League goal of the season, Arsenal's third as they came back from 1–0 down to beat Everton 3–1. Three days later, he scored Arsenal's second in a 5–2 win away to Fenerbahçe in the 2008–09 Champions League, rounding the goalkeeper before finishing from a tight angle.

Walcott dislocated his right shoulder in November while training with England for a friendly against Germany. He underwent surgery to correct a hereditary weakness, and returned to action in March, but at the end of the season he still felt that it was hampering his performance. In April 2009, he scored against Wigan Athletic, before, four days later in the Champions League quarter-final second leg, he gave his team a 10th-minute lead against Villarreal after receiving a pass from Fàbregas and flicking the ball over the goalkeeper. Arsenal won 4–1 on aggregate.

In the next match, an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea, Walcott put Arsenal ahead in the first half, although they eventually lost 2–1. Three days later, Walcott came off to the bench to run half the length of the field before squaring for Andrey Arshavin to put Arsenal 4–3 up against Liverpool in the 90th minute; the match finished 4–4. In May 2009 he signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.

Walcott's 2009–10 season was marred by injury: he made only 15 starts in all competitions. Problems with lower back, knee and hamstring meant he did not play a full 90 minutes until 9 December, against Olympiacos in the Champions League, as Arsenal, already qualified for the knockout stages, fielded the youngest team ever to start a match in that competition. On 6 March 2010, Walcott scored his second goal of the season against Burnley in a 3–1 victory to give Arsenal a decisive lead, with a left-footed effort from the edge of the box, after cutting inside from the right flank.

For the first hour of the Champions League quarter-final first leg, Arsenal were outclassed by Barcelona, although only two goals behind. Walcott's appearance off the bench was the turning point. He scored within three minutes of entering the match, "brought speed and fearlessness to the hosts' attacks", and was involved in the move that led to Fàbregas' equaliser from the penalty spot. After much debate, Wenger reacted to Walcott's performance by starting him in the second leg. According to BBC Sport's match report, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola "anticipated his inclusion by bringing in the pacy Eric Abidal" to mark him, and Walcott's main contribution was to set up Nicklas Bendtner's opening goal in a 4–1 defeat.

Walcott's start to the 2010–11 season was particularly successful, winning Arsenal's Player of the Month vote in August by a landslide. In the second match of the new Premier League season, Walcott scored the first hat-trick of his club career as Arsenal beat newly promoted Blackpool 6–0. On 27 December 2010, he scored a goal and made an assist to help beat Chelsea 3–1 in what Arsène Wenger dubbed a "must-win" match.

Interviewed after Arsenal's FA Cup third-round tie against Leeds United in January 2011, Walcott admitted diving in the last minute of the match in an unsuccessful attempt to win a penalty kick. He was fouled soon afterwards, legitimately winning a penalty which was converted by Fàbregas to secure a draw and a replay of the fixturewhich Arsenal won. On 21 February, during the 1–0 victory against Stoke City, Walcott caught his studs in the turf, sustaining an ankle injury that ruled him out of the League Cup final and the Champions League last-16 second leg against Barcelona. On the last day of the season, he came off the bench to score the equaliser in a 2–2 draw away to Fulham, and ended up with a then career high of 9 goals in the Premier League and 13 in all competitions.

On 16 August, Walcott scored his first goal of the season in the first leg of a Champions League qualifying match against Udinese, giving a vital 1–0 win to Arsenal to carry on into the second leg of the tie. Walcott scored again in the second leg as Arsenal came from behind to win 2–1 and 3–1 on aggregate which helped Arsenal secure qualification for the lucrative group stage of the competition for the 14th straight season. Walcott scored Arsenal's first goal in the 2011–12 Premier League campaign against Manchester United though this was a mere consolation as Arsenal lost 8–2. He netted his fourth goal on 29 October in a 5–3 win at Chelsea where he picked up the ball on the wing, slipped, then got up and jinked past two Chelsea players before scoring.

Walcott scored his first goal of 2012 in the 3–2 defeat at Swansea City, chipping the ball over Swans goalkeeper Michel Vorm. On 4 February 2012, he was involved in the build-up for three goals in the 7–1 home victory against Blackburn Rovers, setting up two goals for Robin van Persie and one for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. On 26 February, Walcott scored two second-half goals against Tottenham Hotspur to help them win 5–2 after being 0–2 down in the North London derby. On 24 March, Walcott scored Arsenal's second goal in a 3–0 home win over Aston Villa before being substituted by Oxlade-Chamberlain on the 78th minute. An injury in a 0–0 draw with Chelsea on 21 April looked set to rule Walcott out for the rest of the season but he was able to return in a substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 3–2 win for Arsenal over West Bromwich Albion.

On 15 September 2012, Walcott came on as a substitute for Gervinho and scored his first goal of the season in a 6–1 win over his former club Southampton. On 26 September, he scored twice in a 6–1 win against Coventry City in the League Cup. On 7 October 2012 Walcott once again found the back of the net in a 3–1 away victory against West Ham United to take his number of goals already up to four. On 30 October 2012, Walcott scored Arsenal's first goal in first half stoppage time and their fourth goal in second half stoppage time in a League Cup tie at Reading to help the club complete a comeback from 4–0 down to 4–4. Arsenal won 7–5 in extra time, in which Walcott completed his hat-trick and backed up his argument that he should be played as a striker. Former Gunner Niall Quinn praised Walcott's performance as incredible, in what he described as "the most extraordinary game that I've seen." This took him to five League Cup goals for the season, a total which would make him the top scorer in the 2012–13 competition.

On 6 November, Walcott opened the scoring in the 2–2 draw at Schalke 04 in the Champions League. On 17 November, Walcott scored the fifth goal in a repeat of the previous season's 5–2 win over Tottenham. On 29 December, Walcott was deployed as a lone striker and scored his first Premier League hat-trick of the season and provided two assists in an emphatic 7–3 win over Newcastle United. One of Walcott's strikes against Newcastle was voted as the Goal of the Month for November on the BBC's Match of the Day.

On 18 January 2013, Walcott ended speculation about his future when he signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Arsenal. Two days later Walcott scored Arsenal's only goal in a 2–1 defeat to Chelsea. This started a run of four successive matches in which he scored, with Walcott also scoring in a 5–1 win against West Ham United on 23 January, a 3–2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup and a 2–2 draw at home to Liverpool. He scored the opening goal after just 2 minutes in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United. He then scored his 20th goal of the season against Queens Park Rangers after just 20 seconds. The match ended 1–0 and Walcott's goal became the fastest goal of the Premier League that season. Walcott scored another goal in a 4–1 victory over Wigan Athletic which resulted in Wigan's relegation. Walcott finished the season with 14 goals and 12 assists from 32 Premier League matches and scoring 21 times with 16 assists in all competitions to be Arsenal's top scorer.

Walcott started the 2013–14 campaign in good form, registering assists against Fenerbahçe in the Champions League play-off round as well as against Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, and scoring against Olympique de Marseille in the Champions League group stage. He suffered an abdominal injury in late September that required surgery, and was out of action for two months, returning against his former club Southampton in late November.

He appeared as a substitute in Arsenal's next four fixtures, assisting goals against Cardiff City and Everton, and started his first match since returning from injury, against Manchester City on 14 December. He scored twice against City, but could not prevent Arsenal from losing the match 6–3. On 26 December, his two goals against West Ham United included the first headed goal of his club career.

Walcott injured a knee late in the FA Cup third-round tie against Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates Stadium in January 2014. In response to abuse from the area holding the visiting fans while he was being stretchered off, Walcott made a hand gesture that reflected the 2–0 scoreline, and he and the stretcher-bearers were pelted with coins and other missiles thrown from that area. The Football Association "reminded him of his responsibilities", but took no further action. The injury, a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee, meant he was ruled out for at least six months, so would miss the rest of the season and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 1 November 2014, Walcott came off the bench in the 81st minute during a 3–0 Premier League home victory against Burnley for his first Gunners appearance in ten months. He made his first start of the season against Hull City in the third round of the FA Cup on 4 January 2015, exactly a year after sustaining his injury at the same stage of the competition. On 25 January, Walcott scored his first goal of 2014–15 campaign in the second minute of Arsenal's 3–2 FA Cup fourth-round win at Brighton & Hove Albion.

In February 2015, Walcott scored in successive home league victories. On 1 February 2015, Walcott netted in a 5–0 defeat of Aston Villa, before scoring what proved to be the winner in a 2–1 win against Leicester City nine days later.

On 17 May 2015, Walcott's deflected shot, which was registered as a Tyler Blackett own goal, rescued a point in a 1–1 draw at Manchester United. One week later, in Arsenal's final match of the Premier League season, Walcott scored a 34-minute hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion at the Emirates Stadium.

On 30 May, Walcott was selected to start at centre forward for Arsenal in the 2015 FA Cup Final, scoring the opening goal in the team's 4–0 victory against Aston Villa.

Ahead of the new season, it was announced that Walcott had extended his contract with Arsenal after prolonged negotiations. Walcott netted twice in pre-season in wins against Everton and Wolfsburg, as Arsenal won the Premier League Asia Trophy and the Emirates Cup. He began the 2015–16 season starting at centre forward and assisting Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's winning goal in the 1–0 defeat of Chelsea in the 2015 FA Community Shield on 2 August 2015.

On 12 September, Walcott scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 home victory against Stoke City in the 2015–16 Premier League. He netted three more times in September, including the opener in a 5–2 league win at Leicester City and in back-to-back UEFA Champions League defeats to Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiacos, the latter of which he picked up an assist for an Alexis Sánchez header. His performances saw him voted Arsenal Supporters' Player of the Month for September. He registered another two assists in a 3–0 home league win over Manchester United on 4 October. On 21 December, Walcott opened the scoring in a 2–1 league defeat of Manchester City at The Emirates.

On 8 March, Walcott scored a brace in a 4–0 away victory over Hull City in a FA Cup replay

Walcott started Arsenal's opening match against Liverpool, in which he missed a penalty after being brought down by Alberto Moreno, however, he made-up for his earlier miss by scoring Arsenal's opener, however Arsenal still lost the match 3–4. Walcott scored his second goal of the season and his 100th career goal after linking up with Alex Iwobi to chip the ball over Hull City goalkeeper Eldin Jakupović to score Arsenal's second goal in a 4–1 win. He then netted his first Champions League goals of the season with a brace in a 2–0 win over Basel on 30 September.

On 17 December 2016, Walcott scored the opening goal of a 2–1 loss at Manchester City before being substituted with a calf injury. He returned on 28 January 2017, scoring a hat-trick against former club Southampton in the fourth round of the FA Cup at St. Mary's Stadium. He scored his 100th goal for Arsenal on 20 February in the next round of the FA Cup in a 2–0 victory over Sutton United. On 5 April, Walcott captained Arsenal to a 3–0 win in their league match at The Emirates against London rivals West Ham United; he scored the second goal, which was his 19th and last of the season and took his total to 104. He was an unused substitute as Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–1 in the 2017 FA Cup Final.

With the scores tied at 1–1 after normal time, Walcott converted his kick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 4–1 on penalties to win the 2017 Community Shield, but throughout his last season at Arsenal, he was mainly used in the Europa League and in the EFL Cup, and he only made 6 substitute appearances in the Premier League. By October, he was increasingly on the fringes at Arsenal, and was criticised following a poor performance when made captain in a 2–1 League Cup victory at home to Championship side Norwich City. with Arsenal's second highest goalscorer Ian Wright suggesting that for Walcott's own good, he needed to leave the club, a view with which Wenger disagreed. Walcott did score 4 goals during his last season at the club, against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup , and 3 in the Europa League group stage, all coming against BATE Borisov, with 2 away, and 1 at home.

On 17 January 2018, Walcott signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Everton in what the BBC reported as "a deal worth more than £20m". He made his debut for the club three days later, providing the assist for Oumar Niasse's equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home to West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. He then recorded a brace in his next match, a 2–1 win over Leicester.

On 8 May 2006, Walcott was surprisingly named in Sven-Göran Eriksson's squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, despite having only made 13 appearances in senior football and making none since joining Arsenal. Even with first-choice strikers Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen both recovering from injury, Walcott was selected over established Premier League strikers Darren Bent (the highest-scoring English forward in the Premier League in the 2005–06 season), Andrew Johnson (the top English goalscorer in the Premier League in the 2004–05 season), Dean Ashton (like Bent, already an established player at England Under-21 level) and Jermain Defoe.

On 25 May 2006, Walcott came on as a second-half substitute for the England B team against Belarus. On 30 May 2006, he became England's youngest ever senior player by appearing in a 3–1 friendly win over Hungary at Old Trafford aged 17 years and 75 days. Despite being one of only two fully fit strikers in the England squad (the other being Peter Crouch), he did not play during the tournament. Eriksson defended his decision, claiming that the experience would serve Walcott well for future tournaments.

After the World Cup, Eriksson stepped down as England manager. New appointment Steve McClaren put Walcott into the England Under-21s, claiming he was "toughening up" on his squad selections.

On 15 August 2006, Walcott became the youngest player ever to score for the England under-21 team when he scored the opener after three minutes in England's 2–2 draw with Moldova at Ipswich Town's ground Portman Road. The match against Moldova was his first cap for the England under-21s.

Walcott scored two goals against Germany to seal qualification for England to the Under-21 European Championship, in the playoff second leg in October 2006, with his second drawing comparisons with Thierry Henry. Over the summer of 2009, Walcott participated in England under-21 team's 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship campaign despite protestations from his club manager, Arsène Wenger. Wenger complained that Walcott's participation in the tournament as well as matches with the senior squad would lead to burn out and injury.

England reached the final of the U21 Euros, where they lost 4–0 to Germany, with Walcott thus earning a silver medal as a runner-up.

On 6 September 2008, Walcott made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against Andorra, and in the following match against Croatia on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England. In doing so, Walcott also became the first England player to score a hat-trick in a competitive match since Michael Owen in 2001.

Walcott returned to the international fold on 3 March 2010 in a friendly against Egypt. It was his first international start for nine months. He faded after a bright start and was replaced by Shaun Wright-Phillips after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at Wembley Stadium. His performance came under heavy criticism from Chris Waddle who said of Walcott, "I've never seen him develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. It's all off the cuff. I just don't think he's got a football brain and he's going to have problems. Let's be honest, good defenders would catch him offside every time."

Walcott started England's friendly victories against Mexico and Japan in May 2010. However, on 1 June 2010, it was announced that Walcott had been left out of England's 23-man World Cup squad by Fabio Capello. On 4 July, a few days after England's exit from the World Cup, Lionel Messi said that he was shocked by Walcott's exclusion as he believed that Walcott could have made the difference against Germany and Algeria. In January 2011, Capello admitted that he had made a mistake in not selecting Walcott for the 2010 World Cup.

In the Euro 2012 qualifying match against Switzerland on 7 September 2010, Walcott was stretchered off after he was clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes putting him out of action for several weeks.

At UEFA Euro 2012, Walcott appeared for England as a second-half substitute in the group match against Sweden. Shortly after coming on, Walcott scored to bring the match level at 2–2. Less than 15 minutes later, he provided the cross for Danny Welbeck's 74th-minute winner in England's 3–2 victory. Afterwards, England manager Roy Hodgson praised Walcott's "enormous" impact on the match, while Lee Dixon on the BBC said Walcott had "changed the game". Walcott also played in the final group match against Ukraine which England won 1–0.

Walcott started in England's 5–0 win against San Marino, but was injured in an early clash with the goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini. After treatment on the touchline, he was substituted for Aaron Lennon, and then taken to hospital as a precaution, where he underwent "scans and tests" according to England manager Roy Hodgson, Walcott was later ruled out of England's next match against Poland, he did not start a match in the qualifiers until almost a year later on 6 September, when he played the full 90 minutes in the 4–0 win against Moldova, he also played 87 minutes in the following match against Ukraine, which ended in a 0–0 draw, but he was injured before England's match against Montenegro and he was still out against Poland, which England won 2–0 to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil.

Having missed out on the 2014 World Cup through injury, Walcott was not selected by Roy Hodgson for the 26-man provisional Euro 2016 squad announced in May 2016. Hodgson commented, "Theo unfortunately has not got such a regular match over the last few months and has had a few problems with injury. It's a tough decision but it's one you have to take."

Walcott was informed by England manager Gareth Southgate on 16 March 2017, his 28th birthday, that he was being dropped from the squad to play a friendly against Germany and a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Lithuania, despite scoring 17 goals in 29 appearances in all club competitions during the 2016–17 season. Southgate said that Walcott had not transferred his early season form into the England matches against Malta and Slovenia in October 2016 and Spain in November 2016.

Walcott is well known for his rapid pace, with former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola declaring that "you would need a pistol to stop him." He has been likened by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger to the club's all-time leading scorer, Thierry Henry. FIFA World Player of the Year winner Lionel Messi has described Walcott as "one of the most dangerous players I have ever played against." In addition to his speed, Walcott also possesses good balance, movement and technique.

His family made a cameo appearance in the 2007 film "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", directed by David Yates, the partner of Walcott's aunt. Walcott himself was due to appear as well, but his commitments to Arsenal forced him to drop out. His cousin Jacob Walcott was a trainee at Reading and a member of the England national under-17 football team appearing in the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. His older sister, Hollie, is a bodybuilder who came second in the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation Central Championships in July 2010.

Walcott has been in a long-term relationship with Melanie Slade, after meeting in 2004 at the WestQuay shopping centre in Southampton. The couple married at the Castello di Vincigliata in Tuscany, Italy, in June 2013. Their first son Finley James Walcott was born on 10 April 2014, with their second son, Arlo, being born on 26 November 2016.

Walcott has been involved with the UK charities Build a School and Best Beginnings. He also has a pie named in his honour at the Arsenal pie shop in Holloway, which won a gold award at the British Pie Awards of 2015.

On 6 April 2008, Walcott was a torchbearer for the Olympic Flame for Beijing 2008 as it was paraded around London. He was the penultimate torchbearer just before Dame Kelly Holmes.

When Walcott was 14 years old, he signed an endorsement deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. In November 2012 he appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside Eden Hazard and Raheem Sterling.

In February 2015, Walcott announced a new sponsorship deal with Adidas. Walcott appeared in an advert for Adidas in August 2016, showing off his skills in dribbling and flicking a ball into the open top of a wheelie bin.

Walcott features in EA Sports' "FIFA" video game series. One of his goal celebrations – ‘pat-a-cake’ dance with Mesut Özil – appears in "FIFA 14".

Walcott currently has four published books – ""T.J. and the Hat-Trick", "T.J. and the Penalty", "T.J. and the Winning Goal" and "T.J. and the Cup Run"". The first two were published in April 2010, with the latter two being published in August 2010. All four were published by Corgi Children's.

In August 2011, Walcott's autobiography "Theo: Growing Up Fast" was published by Bantam Press. The book caused controversy because of his criticism of England manager Fabio Capello, whom he describes as "cold and clinical".

Lucas Digne

Lucas Digne (; born 20 July 1993) is a French professional footballer who plays as a left-back for English club Everton and the France national team.

Digne began his career at Lille before joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2013. After spending a season on loan at Roma, he moved to Barcelona in July 2016. Despite not playing regularly at either club, he won 12 honours at Paris and Barcelona combined. He joined Everton in August 2018.

He won the 2013 World Cup with France under-20, and made his senior international debut in March 2014. He represented France at 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, where his nation reached the final.

Born in Meaux, Seine-et-Marne, Digne finished his development at Lille, signing his first professional contract on 27 July 2010 for three years. Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Digne was promoted to the senior team permanently and assigned the number 3 shirt. He made his professional debut on 26 October 2011 in a 6–1 victory over Sedan in the last 16 of the Coupe de la Ligue.

In January 2012, Digne extended his contract until 2016. On 28 January, he made his Ligue 1 debut at the Stadium Nord Lille Metropole, playing the final two minutes of a 3–0 win over Saint-Étienne. He totalled 16 league appearances as the defending champions came third.

Digne was a regular in the 2012–13 season. On 23 February 2013, having given Lille the lead in a 3–1 win at Ajaccio when his cross was deflected in by Yoann Poulard, he was sent off after an hour for a foul on Matthieu Chalmé. He scored his first goal on 7 April, a penalty in a 5–0 home win over Lorient, and two weeks later he added another to equalise in a 2–1 comeback victory at Bastia.

On 17 July 2013, Digne signed a five-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain, on a fee believed to be around €15 million. On 3 August, he was an unused substitute as they won the 2013 Trophée des Champions with a 2–1 victory over Bordeaux in Gabon. He did not make his debut until 13 September in a 2–0 win at the same opponents, as manager Laurent Blanc rotated his squad ahead of the UEFA Champions League. PSG ended the season with both the league and league cup titles, though Digne was back-up to Brazilian veteran Maxwell.

Digne played the full 90 minutes in the 2014 Trophée des Champions, which PSG won 2–0 against Guingamp in Beijing. The Parisians won all four domestic honours in 2014–15, with Digne an unused substitute in their Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue final victories.

On 26 August 2015, Italian Serie A club Roma signed Digne from PSG on a season-long loan deal for €2.5 million, with the option to make the move permanent at the end of the season. He made his debut five days later, playing the entire match in a 2–1 victory against title holders Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico. He blew a sarcastic kiss at opponent Roberto Pereyra and advised him to check the scoreboard, a gesture likened to one by Roma captain Francesco Totti to Igor Tudor of the same rival in a 4–0 win in February 2004.

Digne scored his first goal for the "Giallorossi" on 26 September with a close-range header in a 5–1 home win over Carpi, having earlier assisted Kostas Manolas in opening his account for the club. Against the same opponents on 12 February, he returned from injury to score from 30 metres in a 3–1 win, and on 17 April he opened a 3–3 draw at Atalanta. The team from Italy's capital came third in Serie A, and Digne declared that he wanted the move to be made permanent.

On 13 July 2016, Digne joined Spanish La Liga side Barcelona on a five-year deal. The fee was €16.5 million (£13.8 million), with the possibility to increase to €20.5 million (£17.1 million), according to individual and team results. On 14 August 2016, Digne made his first appearance for Barcelona in a 0–2 victory against Sevilla in the 2016 Supercopa de España first leg, as a 27th-minute substitute for compatriot Jérémy Mathieu.

He played 26 total games in his first season at the Camp Nou, scoring once in a 7–0 (8–1 aggregate) win over Segunda División B club Hércules in the last 32 of the Copa del Rey on 21 December 2016. Barcelona won that cup, with Digne unused in the final on 27 May 2017, a 3–1 win over Alavés.

Digne played 20 times in 2017–18 as Barcelona won the league and cup double under new manager Ernesto Valverde. On 18 October 2017, he scored from Lionel Messi's assist in a 3–1 home win over Olympiacos in the Champions League group stage.

Digne joined English club Everton on 1 August 2018, for a five-year deal on an initial fee of £18 million. He made his debut ten days later, replacing double goalscorer and fellow debutant Richarlison for the last four minutes of a 2–2 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers. On his first start on 29 August in a 3–1 EFL Cup win against Rotherham United, he assisted a goal from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Digne made his first Premier League start for Everton four days later in a home game against Huddersfield Town, and assisted Dominic Calvert-Lewin's headed equaliser in a 1–1 draw.

By the start of October, Digne had become Everton's first-choice left back, ahead of veteran Leighton Baines. He scored his first goal for the club on 10 December, in the sixth minute of stoppage time at the end of a match against Watford, curling in a free kick for a 2–2 draw. Sixteen days later he scored twice in a 5–1 win at Burnley, with a free kick and a 30-yard shot. On 29 January 2019 he was sent off in a 1–0 win at Huddersfield for denying Adama Diakhaby a goalscoring opportunity with a foul.

Digne was a French youth international and represented his nation at the U16, U17, and U18 levels. At the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, he played every match as France won the title.

He was first called up for the senior side in February 2014, ahead of a friendly match against the Netherlands on 5 March. He debuted in that match, as a half-time substitute for Patrice Evra in a 2–0 win at the Stade de France.

In June, manager Didier Deschamps named Digne as one of 23 members of the French squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, wearing the number 17 shirt. His one appearance for the eventual quarter-finalists was the third group game against Ecuador, in which he suffered a foul that earned the Ecuadorian captain Antonio Valencia a straight red card.

Digne was chosen for the French squad that came runners-up on home soil at UEFA Euro 2016, but did not play. He was put on standby for the squad at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Digne was in Barcelona when it was hit by a terror attack on 17 August 2017, and gave first aid to the victims.

Yerry Mina

Yerry Fernando Mina González (; born 23 September 1994) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for English club Everton and the Colombia national team. He shares the record for most goals in a single World Cup by a defender, with three goals at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Born in Guachené, Mina was a Deportivo Pasto youth graduate, joining the side only at the age of 18. Promoted to the main squad during the 2013 season, he made his senior debut on 20 March of that year by starting in a 0–1 away loss against Dépor in the year's Copa Colombia.

Mina made his Categoría Primera A debut on 15 September 2013, starting in a 0–0 draw at Deportivo Cali. His first professional goal occurred on 18 October, as he scored his team's first in a 2–2 home draw against Atlético Huila.

On 14 December 2013, Mina moved to fellow top tier club Independiente Santa Fe, initially on a one-year loan deal. He made his debut for the club the following 25 January, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 home win against Rionegro.

Mina immediately became a regular starter for the side, winning the 2015 Superliga Colombiana by netting the first goal in the 2–0 win against Atlético Nacional in the second leg of the Finals.

On 1 May 2016, Mina was confirmed as the new player of Palmeiras, but only joined the club in the following month. He signed a five-year contract with the club eleven days later.

Mina made his debut for the club on 4 July 2016, playing a full game in a 3–1 away defeat of Sport Recife. His first goal for the "Verdão" arrived in the following fixture, a 1–1 draw against Santos. He was however substituted off just before the end of the first half due to an apparent injury which had left the defender in tears as he exited the field on a stretcher. On 13 July it was confirmed that Mina would not recover in time for the 2016 Summer Olympics, with the expectancy of the injury estimated to be 6–8 weeks.

Mina fully recovered from injury in late August 2016, being an undisputed starter during the latter stages of the season. In September, he scored goals against rivals São Paulo and Corinthians, and finished the year with four league goals as his team lifted the trophy after a 22-year absence.

On 11 January 2018, FC Barcelona and Palmeiras reached an agreement for the transfer of Yerry Mina for the remainder of the season and five more until 30 June 2023. This made him the first ever Colombian to play for the club. The cost of the transfer was €11.8 million and his release clause was set at €100 million.
Mina made his debut replacing Gerard Piqué in the 83rd minute of the Copa del Rey semi-final against Valencia. Barcelona would go on to win the match 2–0 and advance to the final. He would make his home and league debut against Getafe, starting and playing the full game to a 0–0 draw. He made his first official contribution at the club as he assisted Ousmane Dembélé in a 5–1 defeat of Villarreal.

On 8 August 2018, Mina signed with Premier League team Everton in a deal worth €30 million.

His first appearance came during a 3–1 home victory against Brighton and Hove Albion, as a last minute substitute for Gylfi Sigurdsson.

He scored his first goal for Everton in a 5–1 away win against Burnley, a header inside the opening 2 minutes of the match following a great cross from Bernard.

In 2016, Mina was named to Colombia's Copa América Centenario squad, starting one game against Costa Rica. He played in five of Colombia's 2018 World Cup Qualifying matches from October 2016 to March 2017, and in May 2018 he was named in Colombia’s final 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

At the 2018 World Cup, Mina scored three goals for Colombia, all coming from headers off corner kicks. Mina did not play in Colombia's opening 2–1 loss with Japan, but started at centre back in each of Colombia's remaining matches. In the group stage, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win over Poland, then scored the lone goal in a 1–0 win over Senegal which propelled Colombia to the top of their group and into the knockout stage. Against England in the round of sixteen, Mina tied the scoring 1–1 in the 93rd minute to send the game into extra time. Colombia went on to lose the game on penalty kicks, ending their tournament. With his three goals, he tied the record number of goals scored by a defender in a single World Cup tournament, sharing the record with Germans Paul Breitner in 1974 and Andreas Brehme in 1990.

Yerry Mina's father and uncle were both professional football goalkeepers. His father advised him to play another position and his uncle took him to Deportivo Pasto's trial.

His uncle, Jair Mina, is also his agent.

Mina is a devout Christian and is a member of the neo-Pentecostal Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International. Mina has spoken publically at many events sponsered by the church to talk about his life and faith.

Cenk Tosun

Cenk Tosun (; born 7 June 1991) is a Turkish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Everton and the Turkey national team.

After making one Bundesliga appearance for Eintracht Frankfurt, he transferred to Gaziantepspor in January 2011, where he won the Spor Toto Cup in 2012. In 2014, he was signed by Beşiktaş and won two Süper Lig titles before transferring to Everton in January 2018 for a reported £27 million transfer fee.

Tosun was born in Germany and represented the country from under-16 to under-21 level. He then changed his allegiance to Turkey, for whom he made his senior international debut with in 2013, and played at UEFA Euro 2016.

Born in Wetzlar in the German state of Hesse, Tosun began his career with Eintracht Frankfurt. He played mainly for the reserves in the Regionalliga. His sole first team appearance was on 8 May 2010 in the final match of the 2009–10 Bundesliga season as a 75th-minute substitute for Martin Fenin in a 3–1 loss at VfL Wolfsburg.

On 29 January 2011, Tosun joined Gaziantepspor for a €400,000 transfer fee. He scored 10 goals in 14 league matches in his debut season. After a less successful second season, he scored double digits in the following two campaigns and helped the club win the Spor Toto Cup in 2012. He scored twice in the final, a 3–1 win over Orduspor on 17 May 2012.

On 4 February 2014, Beşiktaş signed Tosun on a five-year contract worth nearly €500,000, effective from the 2014–15 season. He chose the number 23 shirt after basketball player Michael Jordan. In his first two campaigns at the Istanbul club, he was mainly a substitute, behind Demba Ba and Mario Gómez in the pecking order. After Ba and Gómez left, he was a regular in the 2016–17 season, scoring 24 goals as his club won the Süper Lig title. He then turned down a move to Premier League club Crystal Palace.

In 2017–18, Tosun scored four goals in six match as Beşiktaş won a UEFA Champions League group containing RB Leipzig, Porto and Monaco, including both of a 2–1 win at Monaco on 17 October.

On 5 January 2018, Tosun joined Premier League club Everton for a reported £27 million transfer fee, signing a four-and-a-half-year contract with the Merseyside club. He made his debut eight days later, playing 61 minutes of a 4–0 loss away to Tottenham Hotspur. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 away loss against Burnley on 3 March. Manager Sam Allardyce praised Tosun when he received criticism for the start of his Everton career. Tosun and fellow new signing Theo Walcott helped an Everton side that had struggled for goals in the first half of the season as the club finished in eighth place in the 2017–18 Premier League.

Tosun played for Germany under-19 in qualification for the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. In the qualifying group in Luxembourg, he scored twice in a 5–0 win over Moldova and a consolation goal in a 2–1 loss to Turkey. He scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Poland in the Elite Round, but Germany did not advance to the finals in France.

On 16 November 2010, Tosun made his under-21 debut in a 2–0 friendly win over England in Wiesbaden, scoring a penalty for the second goal.

Tosun made his senior international debut for Turkey on 15 October 2013, replacing Selçuk İnan for the final 16 minutes of a 2–0 loss to the Netherlands in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul; the result ended the Turks' hope of qualification. On 13 November 2015, he scored his first international goal, the winner in a 2–1 friendly triumph away to Qatar. He added another two goals on 24 March 2016 in a 2–1 friendly win over Sweden in Antalya.

Tosun was part of the 23-man squad chosen by head coach Fatih Terim for UEFA Euro 2016 in France. He started in the opening match, a 1–0 loss to Croatia, but was dropped in favour of Burak Yılmaz for the following match against Spain. Tosun then returned as an added-time substitute in the 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in Lens that was not enough to take Turkey to the round of 16.

In Turkey's failed qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup, Tosun scored five goals. These were braces in both matches against Finland, and the only goal of a home win over eventual qualifiers Croatia on 5 September 2017. On 1 June 2018, Tosun scored a penalty to open a 2–2 friendly draw with Tunisia in Geneva, then was sent-off for the first time in his career for a confrontation with the Turkish fans; he said he intervened because he thought his father was being attacked in the crowd.

Tosun has said his ability is equal with his left and right foot, as his father Senol forbade him from using his right foot in an attempt to strengthen his left. As a boy, he idolised Argentine forward Gabriel Batistuta. While Tosun likens himself to Mario Gómez and Zlatan Ibrahimović, "The Times" writer Gary Jacob instead found him more similar to the English strikers Kevin Davies and Andy Carroll for his physicality.

Idrissa Gana Gueye (born 26 September 1989) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for club Everton and the Senegal national team.

Born in Dakar, Gueye spent his early career in Senegal for Diambars before joining French club Lille in 2008. He broke through into the first team in the 2010–11 season, in which Lille won Ligue 1, and became a regular starter in the league and the UEFA Champions League over the following four seasons.

On 10 July 2015, Gueye joined English Premier League club Aston Villa for a £9 million transfer fee. On 8 August, he made his debut in a 1–0 away victory over AFC Bournemouth. On 19 January 2016, Gueye scored his first and only goal for Villa in a 2–0 over Wycombe Wanderers in the third round replay of the FA Cup. In total, Gueye made 35 league appearances for Villa as the club was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.

On 2 August 2016 and with Aston Villa relegated from the Premier League, Everton triggered a release clause in Gueye's contract, reported to be £7.1 million, and signed him to a four-year contract. He made the highest number of successful tackles and interceptions per match across Europe's top five leagues over the 2016 calendar year. Gueye scored his first league goal for Everton in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland at Goodison Park on 25 February 2017. He became the first player in Europe's top five leagues to win 100 tackles in the 2016–17 season.

Gueye scored his first goal for Everton in European competition on 17 August 2017 in the UEFA Europa League play-off round first leg against Hajduk Split. In February 2018, he extended his contract with Everton until 2022.

In January 2019, Everton rejected an offer from French club PSG for Gueye.

Gueye made his international debut for Senegal in 2011, and has appeared in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches for them. He also represented them at the 2012 Olympics, at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations and at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.

In May 2018, he was named in Senegal's 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

An energetic midfielder, known for his ball-winning skills, as well as his ability to press opponents and intercept passes, Gueye completed the most tackles during the 2016–17 Premier League season.

Morgan Schneiderlin

Morgan Fernand Gérard Schneiderlin (; born 8 November 1989) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for English club Everton and the France national team.

Schneiderlin began his career with Strasbourg, before moving to England to join Southampton in June 2008. He made 260 appearances across all competitions in seven seasons at the club, and was in the teams which earned consecutive promotions to reach the Premier League. He joined Manchester United for a potential £27 million fee in July 2015, but left for Everton in January 2017 for a fee of up to £24 million.

After representing France at all levels from under-16 onwards, Schneiderlin made his senior international debut in 2014. He was included in their squads for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.

Born in Obernai, Alsace, Schneiderlin started playing football with his friends at the SR Zellwiller football ground, but began his career later with the major regional club Strasbourg's youth ranks in 1995, after members of his family brought him to one of the club's scouting sessions when he was five years old. After 10 years moving through the youth ranks, he signed his first professional contract with the club in 2005 and debuted for the B-team later that year. In 2006, he made his professional debut with the senior side and would go on to make four more appearances for the club, before being sold following the club's relegation during the 2007–08 Ligue 1 season.

Schneiderlin moved from Strasbourg to Championship club Southampton on 27 June 2008, having signed a four-year contract in a deal that could rise to €1.5 million (£1.2 million). He joined Southampton despite receiving an offer from local rivals Portsmouth, then a Premier League team. Schneiderlin made his debut in a 2–1 defeat away to Cardiff City on 9 August 2008.
The Frenchman scored his first goal for Southampton away against Bristol Rovers on 13 April 2010, with the match finishing in a 5–1 victory. Schneiderlin signed a new deal with Saints on 19 August 2011, to keep him at the club until the summer of 2014. On 24 September, he came off the bench to score his second goal for the club in a 1–1 draw at Burnley. He scored a 35-yard effort in a 3–0 victory at Nottingham Forest, meaning he had scored more than one goal in a season for the first time at Southampton.

After promotion to the Premier League, he kept his place in the side, playing the full 90 minutes of the opening game against Manchester City. On 2 September 2012, he scored a goal against Manchester United, giving his side a 2–1 lead but the club eventually fell 3–2 as Robin van Persie netted a hat-trick. Schneiderlin followed this up with another home goal in a 1–1 draw with Swansea City on 10 November, trapping a Rickie Lambert header with his chest and then placing the ball past onrushing goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel.

On 16 January 2013, he captained Southampton in a comeback which saw them draw 2–2 with European champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He went on to score his third Premier League goal in a 2–2 draw with Wigan Athletic on 2 February, helping Southampton fight back from a goal down.

On 25 February 2013, Schneiderlin signed a new contract extension to keep him at Southampton until the summer of 2017. At the end of the season, Schneiderlin was credited for the most tackles, interceptions and highest work rate in the Premier League, establishing himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in England. He picked up both the Players' Player and Fans' Player of the Year awards at Southampton's end of season awards.

Schneiderlin scored twice in a 3–1 win at West Ham United on 30 August 2014, equalling his goal tally from the previous season's Premier League campaign. He scored his third goal of the season against Newcastle United on 13 September, curling in a late strike past goalkeeper Tim Krul, as the Saints won 4–0. On 28 December, he was sent off two minutes from the end of a 1–1 home draw against Chelsea. He suffered a knee injury against Tottenham on 25 April 2015, ruling him out for the remainder of the season.

After much speculation during the summer, Schneiderlin signed for Manchester United on 13 July 2015 for a fee in the region of £25 million. Upon signing for United, he said: "I am delighted to be a Manchester United player. Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make. I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it’s a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss."

On 17 July 2015, he made his debut four days after signing, scoring the only goal – a header – as United beat Club América at CenturyLink Field in Seattle on their pre-season tour. He made his Premier League debut on 8 August as the season opened with a 1–0 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, being chosen by BBC Sport as the best of United's five debutants that day. He scored what would be his only competitive goal for the club on 17 October, opening the scoring in a 3–0 Premier League win away to Everton at Goodison Park. On 21 May, Schneiderlin was an unused substitute in the 2016 FA Cup Final as United beat Crystal Palace 2–1 at Wembley Stadium. He ended his first season with 38 appearances in all competitions, scoring once.

Schneiderlin was in the United squad that faced Leicester City in the 2016 FA Community Shield at Wembley Stadium on 7 August, winning 2–1. United won 2–1 with goals from Jesse Lingard and new United teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović. Due to competition in midfield, he then played less frequently, with a total playing time of 147 minutes in three starts and five substitute appearances during the 2016–17 season. He was later sold to Everton in the January transfer window due to a lack of playing time.

On 12 January 2017, Schneiderlin signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Everton, re-uniting with his former manager Ronald Koeman. The transfer fee was reported as £20 million, rising to £24 million. Schneiderlin made his debut for Everton three days later as a 65th-minute substitute for Kevin Mirallas against Manchester City in a 4–0 win at Goodison Park. He scored his first goal in a 3–0 home victory over West Bromwich Albion on 11 March. Schneiderlin's transfer to Everton represented a real turnaround of fortunes for the player, becoming a starter in the defensive midfield role at the club.

Schneiderlin was sent off on 2 November 2017 as Everton lost 3–0 at Lyon, eliminating them from the UEFA Europa League group stage with two games to spare. In January 2018, West Ham wanted to sign him on loan. Schneiderlin struggled in the 2017–18 season under managers Ronald Koeman and Sam Allardyce, but was told by new boss Marco Silva in June 2018 that he had a future at Goodison Park.

Schneiderlin represented France at under-16, under-17, under-18 whom he captained, and under-19 levels.

In March 2006, he was selected by France to play in the 2007 UEFA European Under-17 Championship elite round qualification campaign, his debut came against the Czech Republic. He played in two further games.

On 25 May 2009, he was selected in the under-20 squad to participate in the 2009 Mediterranean Games. Schneiderlin featured in three of the four matches contested as France finished in fifth place. The following year, he appeared with the under-20 team at the 2010 Toulon Tournament. In the opening game of the tournament against Colombia U20, Schneiderlin scored the first goal in the 34th minute, helping his side win the game 2–0.

In July 2010, he was part of France's team that attempted to qualify for the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played against Malta U21s in a 2–0 victory under coach Erick Mombaerts.

In November 2013, various British media outlets reported that Schneiderlin was eligible to represent England. Under Article 8.1, Regulations Governing The Application of the Statutes, FIFA Statutes, Schneiderlin is only eligible to represent France at international level as he has played at various age-levels in UEFA competitions prior to gaining British citizenship.

On 13 May 2014, France coach Didier Deschamps named Schneiderlin on the team's standby list for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. He was later called into the full squad following the withdrawal of the injured Clément Grenier. On 8 June Schneiderlin made his international debut, replacing Karim Benzema for the final three minutes of an 8–0 friendly win against Jamaica in Lille.

His debut in the World Cup came 17 days later, when he played the full 90 minutes of a 0–0 draw with Ecuador at the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in Brasília; Deschamps made six changes for this final group match due to France's previous good form. This was his only appearance at the tournament, in which France reached the quarter-finals.

Schneiderlin was not initially selected to France's squad for their hosting of UEFA Euro 2016, with Leicester City's N'Golo Kanté chosen at his expense, but he was added following an injury to Lassana Diarra. Schneiderlin did not play in any of France's seven matches as they reached the final.

In March 2016, Schneiderlin became engaged to Camille Sold. They married in June 2017.

Bernard

Bernard ("Bernhard") is a West Germanic masculine given name.

The name is attested from at least the 9th century. West Germanic "Bernhard" is composed from the two elements "bern" "bear" and "hard" "brave, hardy". Its native Old English reflex was "Beornheard", which was replaced by the Old French form "Bernard" after the Norman conquest.

Maarten Stekelenburg

Maarten Stekelenburg (; born 22 September 1982) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Everton and the Netherlands national team.

Stekelenburg began his career at Ajax, playing 282 matches over nine seasons and winning nine honours, including two Eredivisie titles. He went on to play for Roma, Fulham, Monaco, Southampton and Everton.

Stekelenburg made his debut for the Netherlands in 2004, and has earned 58 caps in total as of July 2018. He was understudy to Edwin van der Sar at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008, then was first choice as he helped his nation to the 2010 World Cup final and played at Euro 2012.

Stekelenburg began his career at Zandvoort '75 before joining VV Schoten, which he left for Ajax when he was 15 years old. He made his official debut for Ajax on 24 February 2002, in a match against NAC Breda. At the start of the 2002–03 season, he won his first prize when Ajax won the Johan Cruyff Shield. In 2004, he and Ajax won the Eredivisie championship, having played ten matches that season.

Stekelenburg became the first choice goalkeeper at Ajax in the 2005–06 season. In 2006, he won his first KNVB Cup. At the start of the 2006–07 season, he won his second Johan Cruyff Shield, which he helped his team defend the next season, and later on in 2006–07, he won his second KNVB Cup.

Stekelenburg was named Ajax "Player of the Year" for the 2007–08 season, succeeding Wesley Sneijder.
During the 2008–09 season, he lost his place in the goal to Kenneth Vermeer due to injuries. He re-established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper under new manager Martin Jol and subsequently had a very strong season for both Ajax and the Dutch national side. During the 2009–10 season, Stekelenburg went on to have a consistent season, playing in all of Ajax's Eredivisie and Europa League matches, the latter after they were eliminated from the UEFA Champions League in the group stage. However, Stekelenburg sustained a finger injury which kept him out for the remainder of the season. He made a total of 51 appearances in the 2010–11 season in all competitions.

After winning the 2010–11 Eredivisie on 15 May 2011, Stekelenburg dropped the trophy while standing on top of the Ajax team coach with Jan Vertonghen. He won Ajax Player of the Year for the second time.

On 1 August 2011, it was announced Stekelenburg had officially transferred to Roma for €6.325 million transfer fee plus bonuses, making him the first Dutch footballer to ever play for the Italian club. He picked the number 24 shirt, which is the day his son was born. He made his debut on 11 September 2011, against Cagliari.

On 3 June 2013, Roma sporting director Franco Baldini confirmed he had finalised a deal with Premier League club Fulham for the sale of Stekelenburg. Two days later, on 5 June, Fulham announced Stekelenburg had signed on a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee; Roma later disclosed the fee was €5.6 million. He made his debut on 17 August in a 1–0 win away to Sunderland; however, he came off injured in the second half and was replaced by David Stockdale. He returned on 21 October at a win against Crystal Palace, but went on to lose the next four starts in a row.

Following the sacking of René Meulensteen as Fulham manager, Stekelenburg was dropped to the bench in favour of Stockdale by Felix Magath, and following Fulham's relegation and Stockdale's departure, lost his place in the squad altogether, as Magath favoured Jesse Joronen and Marcus Bettinelli.

On 9 August 2014, Stekelenburg joined French club Monaco on a season-long loan. With Danijel Subašić as Monaco's starting goalkeeper, Stekelenburg was preferred for cup matches, making his debut in the round of 16 of the Coupe de la Ligue away to Lyon on 17 December. After a 1–1 draw at the Stade de Gerland, he helped Monaco win 5–4 in a penalty shootout by saving from Jordan Ferri. In the semi-finals on 4 February 2015 against Bastia at the Stade Louis II, it again went to penalties after a goalless draw. He saved from Guillaume Gillet and Giovanni Sio, but Monaco were eliminated nonetheless. His sole Ligue 1 appearance came on 22 March away to Reims, a 3–1 victory. On 1 June, the club announced Stekelenburg would return to Fulham after his season-long loan expired.

On 22 June 2015, Southampton signed Stekelenburg on a season-long loan from Fulham. He made his debut for the club on 30 July in the third qualifying round of the season's Europa League, a 3–0 win over Vitesse at St Mary's Stadium. He made his Premier League debut for "the Saints" in a 2–2 draw away to Newcastle United on the opening day of the 2015–16 Premier League season.

On 1 July 2016, Everton, managed by compatriot Ronald Koeman, announced they had signed Stekelenburg from Fulham for an undisclosed transfer fee. He made his debut on 13 August as "the Toffees" began their campaign with a 1–1 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, and on 15 October, he saved penalties from Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero to ensure the same result away to Manchester City. Stekelenburg was limped off the field after suffering from a leg injury in the 63rd minute of the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park against Liverpool on 19 December 2016. Stekelenburg returned to action in April 2017, when Ronald Koeman dropped Joel Robles after 17-straight starts by the Spanish goalkeeper.

Stekelenburg was a member of the Dutch squad at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his international debut for the Netherlands on 3 September 2004 against Liechtenstein, whom they beat 3–0.

Stekelenburg was called up by manager Marco van Basten for the squad of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but he did not play any match during this tournament as Edwin van der Sar was first choice.

Despite his international debut in 2004, Stekelenburg was called-up to Van Basten's UEFA Euro 2008 squad to play as understudy to Van der Sar. He participated in the Group C match against Romania on 17 June—with the Netherlands already having qualified for the quarter-finals, the coach fielded a second-string side to give players like Stekelenburg an appearance. He kept a clean sheet in the 2–0 win at the Stade de Suisse in Bern.

In a September 2008 friendly match against Australia, Stekelenburg was sent-off after 44 minutes of the first half for fouling Joshua Kennedy, becoming the first goalkeeper of the Dutch national side to receive a red card.

After Van der Sar's retirement from the national team, Stekelenburg became the Netherlands' first-choice goalkeeper under manager Bert van Marwijk. Stekelenburg was included in the preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 27 May 2010, Van Marwijk announced he would be part of the final 23-man squad participating in the competition. Stekelenburg helped the Netherlands reach the final of the competition against Spain by making key saves throughout the tournament, from Kaká in the Netherlands' 2–1 victory against Brazil in the quarter-finals. He conceded six goals in the whole tournament, two of them being penalty kicks. Despite making a number of saves in the final, he ended up on the losing side, conceding the match's only goal to Andrés Iniesta in the 116th minute.

Stekelenburg played all three matches during the group stages of Euro 2012 as the Netherlands finished bottom of their group.

On 7 October 2016, four years after his last international appearance, Stekelenburg started in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Belarus, a 4–1 Dutch victory.

Séamus Coleman

Séamus Coleman (born 11 October 1988) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Everton and is captain of the Republic of Ireland national team.

Originally a Gaelic footballer, Coleman started his association football career with amateur club St Catherine's in Killybegs. He joined League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers in 2006 after impressing in a friendly against them. He then made the move to England to sign for Everton in January 2009 for a £60,000 fee. In 2010, he spent half a season on loan with Blackpool, helping them win promotion via the Championship play-offs, before returning to Everton where he has made over 200 appearances, and has been regarded as one of the league's top full-backs.

Coleman has been a senior international for the Republic of Ireland since 2011, acquiring over 40 caps. He won the 2011 Nations Cup and was awarded the FAI Under-21 International Player of the Year in both 2009 and 2010. He was selected for the Ireland squad at UEFA Euro 2016, captaining Ireland against both Italy and France. He was named the new Ireland captain in September 2016 following Robbie Keane's international retirement.

Coleman was born in the fishing port of Killybegs,<ref name="http://www.thescore.ie"></ref> in the Irish county of Donegal. Originally a Gaelic footballer who, aged 16, played as a back on his local GAA team Na Cealla Beaga, Coleman was spotted by Sligo Rovers when he lined up against them in a friendly for his hometown club, St Catherine's. He made his League of Ireland debut against Derry City at the Brandywell in October 2006 as a substitute for Adam Hughes.

Sligo Rovers coach Rob McDonald did not rate Coleman very highly as a player, telling him that he should join League of Ireland First Division club Finn Harps. McDonald departed Sligo Rovers in March 2007, and was replaced by Paul Cook, of whom Coleman later said: "He made me feel like I was the best player in the League. It just makes such a difference when you have a manager who believes in you".

Coleman was sent off on 28 September 2007 in a 3–0 loss at Bohemians, for a two-footed challenge on their substitute John-Paul Kelly. He scored his only goal for Rovers against Bray Wanderers on 17 May 2008, concluding a 3–0 win.

Following a recommendation by Willie McStay to former teammate and Everton manager David Moyes, Coleman was signed by the Merseyside club for £60,000 in January 2009, ahead of other interest from Ipswich Town, Birmingham City and Celtic. Before playing a game for Everton, Coleman had to undergo surgery on a career-threatening infected blister. He made his debut on 22 October 2009 in the Europa League group stage in a 5–0 loss to Benfica at the Estádio da Luz, being beaten to the ball by Javier Saviola for the first goal. Three days later in his Goodison Park debut, a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur, Coleman was named Man of the Match after coming on as a first-half substitute for the injured Joseph Yobo, and played an instrumental part for both of Everton's goals in a 2–2 draw. He made his FA Cup debut against Carlisle United in the third round on 2 January 2010, replacing Tony Hibbert in the 80th minute and creating a goal for Tim Cahill two minutes later, in a 3–1 home win.

On 19 March 2010, Coleman joined Championship club Blackpool on loan, initially for one month as a replacement for the injured Neal Eardley. He made his debut the next day, in a 2–2 draw at home to Crystal Palace. He scored his first goal for the "Tangerines" in a 4–2 win away to Scunthorpe United on 2 April. Later that month, Coleman's loan was extended until the end of the season, while on 19 May he agreed a new four-year contract with Everton. He played in Blackpool's play–off final at Wembley Stadium, which they won 3–2 against Cardiff City.

Coleman returned to Everton for the following season, breaking into the first team on the right of midfield. He scored his first goal for Everton against Brentford in the League Cup third round on 21 September 2010. He opened the scoring at Griffin Park in the sixth minute, but also gave away a penalty with a foul on Myles Weston, which Ján Mucha saved from Charlie MacDonald, although Brentford eventually won in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. He scored his first Premier League goal against his former team Blackpool on 6 November to secure a 2–2 draw at Bloomfield Road, signed a new four-and-a-half-year deal two months later, and was nominated for the 2011 PFA Young Player of the Year Award. He finished the season having scored four league goals, though was sent off in the final game of the season, a 1–0 win against Chelsea.

On 31 December 2012, Coleman signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract with Everton.

The 2013–14 season proved to be Coleman's best to date as he scored six league goals, more than his previous seasons at the club combined. In April, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year. He was also named Everton's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year. Manager Roberto Martínez hailed Coleman as one of the best full-backs in world football as he was part of a defence which conceded just 39 goals to help Everton finish fifth with a club record of 72 Premier League points. He created 45 chances during the season, the third highest amongst Everton players and had the second highest pass completion at 88%.

On 26 June 2014, Coleman signed a new five-year contract with Everton. He scored his first ever goal in European football for Everton on 18 September 2014, netting their second in a 4–1 win over Wolfsburg in the first match of their Europa League campaign. On 19 February 2015, he was again on target in Europe, in a 4–1 win over BSC Young Boys in the last 32. On 22 March, Coleman scored the first goal in an eventual 2–1 away success against Queens Park Rangers with "Toffees" boss Roberto Martínez praising the full-back for his performance, describing him as "magnificent in his defensive duties" and labelling his opener as "a striker's goal".

Coleman scored his only goal of the 2015–16 season in a 3–0 away victory against Stoke City on 6 February 2016.

On 17 September, he opened his 2016–17 goalscoring account in a 3–1 home win against Middlesbrough with a great solo run and finish on his weaker foot. He scored his second goal of the season on 19 November with an 89th-minute header to equalise in a 1–1 home draw against Swansea City. His first goal of 2017 came on 21 January as he secured all three points with an 87th-minute winner in a 1–0 triumph over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

Coleman suffered a fractured tibia and fibula in his right leg following a dangerous challenge from Neil Taylor whilst on international duty with Ireland in March 2017 and was unlikely to return to action until 2018. It was announced a few days after his injury that FIFA would pay his basic salary for the duration of his rehabilitation.

Coleman made his Everton return on 31 January 2018, in a 2–1 win over Leicester City.

Coleman has represented Ireland U18 schools, helping them retain the Centenary Shield in 2006. He is an Ireland under-21 and under-23 international, having made his debut for the former against Sweden in 2007. On 10 August 2010, Coleman scored his first international goal in a 5–0 win against Estonia. In the same month he won the 2009 FAI Under 21 Player of the Year Award. He retained the award in 2010. He captained Ireland in a 1–0 defeat against Turkey in November 2010.

Coleman received his first call-up to the senior squad in October 2010, and made his full international debut in the Republic of Ireland's inaugural Nations Cup match against Wales on 8 February 2011, which Ireland won 3–0.

On 29 May 2013, Coleman was named Man of the Match for his performance against England at Wembley Stadium. He crossed the ball for Shane Long's opening goal of the game, a header past Joe Hart.
Coleman captained Ireland for the first time in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Germany on 11 October 2013, his 25th birthday, which Ireland lost 3–0 in Cologne.

On 31 May 2016, Coleman was selected in Martin O'Neill's 23-man squad for Euro 2016. At the tournament, he captained Ireland in their final group game victory over Italy. The 1–0 win ensured that the team advanced past the group stages at a UEFA European Championship for the first time. He was also captain for Ireland's Round of 16 match against France in Lyon where the hosts prevailed 2–1 winners.

Coleman was named the permanent Ireland captain in September 2016 following the international retirement of Robbie Keane. The following month, he scored his first senior international goal for Ireland in a 1–0 win over Georgia at the Aviva Stadium in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.

On 24 March 2017, Coleman suffered a broken leg in the 69th minute of a goalless draw in a World Cup qualifier against Wales following a dangerous tackle by Neil Taylor for which the Welshman was given a straight red card. Coleman received treatment on the pitch and was given oxygen as he was comforted by teammate Shane Long before being carried off on a stretcher. He was brought directly to Dublin's St. Vincent's Hospital where he underwent surgery on a fractured tibia and fibula of his right leg. Ireland manager Martin O'Neill stated that Coleman's injury was a "huge blow" to both Ireland and Everton but backed the player to return to his "brilliant" best. Taylor's challenge was widely condemned across the football world with the Aston Villa defender himself said to be "devastated" about causing a serious injury. Wales manager Chris Coleman later revealed that Taylor went into the Ireland team's changing room to apologise for the incident. Many fellow footballers, sports personalities and celebrities took to Twitter to send messages of support to Coleman including Wayne Rooney, Shay Given, Héctor Bellerín, Paul McGrath, Tony Bellew and Niall Horan. On 26 March, O'Neill confirmed the surgery on the right-back's fractured leg had been a success.

Coleman's first call-up since the injury came for the squad to face Turkey on 23 March 2018.

Coleman is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's best full-backs. A quick, skilful and hard-working player with immense stamina, he is renowned for his eagerness to get forward on attacking runs which has established his goalscoring prowess. Coleman has shown a proficiency for having great composure when in possession of the ball and his Everton teammate Ashley Williams has hailed him as one of the best players he has ever played with. 

Despite being very quiet by nature, Coleman has shown great leadership qualities which has propelled him to the role of captain of the Irish national team. He led the Ireland team out for their final two matches at Euro 2016, earning much praise from teammates, fans and media alike. He has since taken on the role of Ireland captain on a permanent basis. In 2018, it was suggested by "ESPN FC" journalist Luke O'Farrell that Coleman should also be the next club captain at Everton, highlighting that the full-back "leads by example and, more importantly, demands more from his teammates. Coleman has never been afraid to let another player know when something is not working or needs improvement. [...] Coleman sets the mark for the rest of the team to follow".

Coleman has two brothers: Francis and Stephen (known as Stevie). His parents are Máire and Henry Coleman. Stevie has cerebral palsy and participated in the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games football event where the Irish team won bronze medals. As a boy, Coleman attended St. Catherine's Vocational School. He supports the Donegal senior football team. He also still follows his local GAA team, Na Cealla Beaga, and attended the final of the 2013 Donegal Senior Football Championship when they lost to Gleann tSuilí.

In June 2015, he married Rachel Cunningham in St. Mary of the Visitation Church in Killybegs, and their daughter, Lilly, was born in February the following year.

Ademola Lookman

Ademola Lookman Olajade Alade Aylola Lookman (born 20 October 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays for Everton of the Premier League, and for the England national under-21 team.

Lookman made his senior debut in 2015, playing as a forward for Charlton Athletic of the Championship, and in January 2017 signed for Everton, who have used him mainly as a winger. He has represented England from under-19 to under-21 levels.

Lookman was born in Wandsworth, London. He attended St Thomas the Apostle College in Peckham where he achieved three A*s and five As at GCSE.

Lookman joined Charlton Athletic's academy in 2014 after signing from Waterloo, a youth football club based in the London Borough of Lambeth. His goalscoring record for Charlton's U18 and U21 teams led to him making a rapid ascent through the Charlton academy ranks and he made his first-team debut for the Addicks on 3 November 2015. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion on 5 December 2015, and then followed that up with both Charlton's goals in a 2–2 draw with Bolton Wanderers ten days later.

Lookman signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Everton on 5 January 2017 for an undisclosed fee, reported as an initial £7.5m potentially rising to £11m with add-ons. He made his debut for the club ten days later in a 4–0 victory over Manchester City, replacing Ross Barkley in the 90th minute and scoring the team's fourth goal. Lookman made his first Euro appearance for Everton in a 1–0 win over MFK Ružomberok in the Europa League third qualifying round first leg.

Although manager Sam Allardyce stated that Lookman would not be leaving on loan in the January 2018 transfer window, he changed his mind, and the club arranged a move to Championship club Derby County, where they hoped he would play regular first-team football. However, the player insisted on an alternative move, and joined Bundesliga club RB Leipzig until the end of the 2017–18 season. In his first game with Leipzig, Lookman scored the winning goal in the away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach after coming on as a late substitute.

Lookman was born in England to parents from Nigeria, and is eligible for the national teams of both countries. He received his first international call-up when he was named in the England U19 squad for two matches against Mexico. He was subsequently named in the squad for the European U19 Championships that summer. In early 2017, Lookman turned down the opportunity to switch allegiance to Nigeria after an approach from the national coach, Gernot Rohr.

Lookman was selected in the England under-20 team for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He scored three goals in the tournament, two against Costa Rica in the last 16. England beat Venezuela 1–0 in the final, to achieve the country's first victory in the final of a global tournament since the 1966 World Cup.

He received his first call-up for the England under-21s for European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands under-21s and Latvia under-21s in September 2017. He made his debut in the first match, and set up Everton teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin for England's goal in a 1–1 draw.

Yannick Bolasie

Yannick Bolasie (born 24 May 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a winger for Anderlecht on loan from Premier League club Everton. Born in Lyon, he has played in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle, Barnet, Bristol City, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. Bolasie has been capped at international level by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Bolasie began his career with Rushden & Diamonds at age 16. He spent four months as a member of their youth team and then had a spell with Hillingdon Borough in the Southern Football League before moving across Europe to play for Floriana in the Maltese Premier League. He returned to England in 2008 after being offered a trial with Plymouth Argyle and impressed enough to be offered a two-year contract. He joined Dagenham & Redbridge on trial with a view to a loan move before returning to Rushden & Diamonds on loan near the end of the year. He made his debut against Eastbourne Borough on 29 November, and made seven appearances in the Conference before returning to Argyle in January 2009. Bolasie then joined Barnet on loan, making his Football League debut against Accrington Stanley on 24 January 2009. He scored his first goal two weeks later, opening the scoring in a 3–3 draw against Grimsby Town.

Bolasie returned to Argyle at the end of the 2008–09 season having made 20 league appearances for Barnet, scoring three goals. The club's manager, Ian Hendon, was keen to bring Bolasie back, but dismissed the chances of signing him permanently. Hendon said, "Yannick is still under contract at Plymouth, so it is likely that he will return there at the end of the season." He rejoined the Barnet squad in July 2009 ahead of the new season on a six-month loan, and hoped it would act as a springboard to winning a place in the Argyle first team. Bolasie scored against Grimsby again in October 2009, capping a fine display with a fierce shot from 30 yards Bolasie scored his second goal of the season three weeks later against Darlington, as Hendon's side maintained a place in the top half of the League Two table.

Bolasie returned to Plymouth Argyle in January 2010, having made a further 22 league appearances for Barnet, scoring twice. He was given a chance to impress by Paul Mariner, who had succeeded Sturrock a month earlier, and included him in the squad to take on Barnsley on 13 February 2010. He made his debut for the club in that game, coming off the substitute bench to provide the momentum to turn a one nil deficit into a 3–1 win for the visitors. He scored his first goal for the club two weeks later at Sheffield United. The pacy winger, ended the season with 16 Championship appearances to his name, but could not prevent the club from being relegated to League One. Bolasie was offered a new contract by the club in April 2010, and Bolasie signed it in July after the arrival of Peter Reid as the club's new manager.

Bolasie was transferred to Bristol City on 6 June 2011 for an undisclosed fee and signed a two-year contract. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against Coventry City on 9 April 2012. Prior to the match against Barnsley later that month, Bolasie was named Young Player of the Year by the Supporters Club and Trust after a fans vote. He submitted a written transfer request in August 2012 because he wanted to move back to London.

In August 2012, Bolasie signed a three-year contract with Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat at Middlesbrough, and scored his first goal for Palace in a 5–0 home win against Ipswich Town.

He signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal for Crystal Palace early in the 2015–16 season.

He made his debut as a substitute in a 2–1 win away against West Bromwich Albion five days later, and three days after that made his first start for Everton, in a 4–0 EFL Cup win at home to Yeovil Town. Bolasie sustained an injury to his right anterior cruciate ligament in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United on 4 December 2016, and was out injured until 26 December 2017.

On 25 August 2018, Bolasie signed for Aston Villa on a season-long loan from Everton. He returned to Everton from his loan early on 21 January 2019.

Bolasie signed for Belgian side Anderlecht on loan for the remainder of the 2018–19 season.

Bolasie was eligible to represent France, England and DR Congo internationally through birth, upbringing and heritage respectively. In January 2013 while playing in the Championship for Crystal Palace, Bolasie rejected the chance to represent the DR Congo in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations claiming that he did not want to disrupt making progress in his club career. In March 2013, Bolasie was again called up to the Democratic Republic of Congo squad, and made his international debut in a 2014 World Cup qualification 0–0 draw with Libya.

Bolasie was selected in the Congolese squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. He scored the equaliser in their first group game, a 1–1 draw against Zambia at the Nuevo Estadio de Ebebiyín on 18 January. The team finished in third place.

His parents were born in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bolasie was born in the French city of Lyon, but moved to England when he was seven months old and grew up in the London borough of Brent. Lomana LuaLua, Kazenga LuaLua and Trésor Kandol are his cousins. His younger brother Ruddock Yala is a footballer, who played for Harrow Borough F.C., Grays Athletic F.C., Borehamwood F.C. and Maldon & Tiptree F.C..

Bolasie holds an active interest in grime music. In 2014, he filmed a rap battle with fellow professional footballer Bradley Wright-Phillips for the long running grime DVD series Lord of the Mics.

Sandro Ramírez

Sandro Ramírez Castillo (; born 9 July 1995), known simply as Sandro, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward for Real Sociedad on loan from Everton. 

He began his professional career at Barcelona playing mainly in their reserves, and won seven domestic and international honours with the first team.

Born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Sandro joined FC Barcelona's youth setup in 2009, aged 14, after starting out at local UD Las Palmas. On 10 June 2013, he was promoted to the former's B-team, and made his professional debut on 17 August in a 1–2 away loss against CD Mirandés for the Segunda División championship.

Sandro scored his first goal as a professional on 15 September 2013, netting the first of a 2–0 home win against Real Madrid Castilla. He finished the campaign with 31 appearances, netting seven times to help his team finish third.

On 18 August 2014, Sandro scored the last of a 6–0 triumph over Club León for that year's Joan Gamper Trophy, after assisting fellow youth graduate Munir El Haddadi in the fifth. He was also called up to the main squad for the match against Elche CF, but eventually remained unused in the 3–0 La Liga win on 24 August.

Sandro made his debut in the Spanish top level on 31 August 2014, coming on as a substitute for Pedro midway through the second half of the fixture at Villarreal CF and scoring the game's only goal 12 minutes later. He netted for the first time in the UEFA Champions League on 21 October, contributing to a 3–1 group stage home win against AFC Ajax with an injury-time strike. On 16 December, he scored his first goal in the Copa del Rey, in a 8–1 home routing of SD Huesca.

On 2 December 2015, in the midst of a lengthy scoring drought for both players, Sandro scored a hat-trick and assisted once whilst Munir contributed with a brace in the 6–1 home win against CF Villanovense for the domestic cup, to send Barcelona into the round of 16. As the former appeared in just ten league games throughout the season, technical director Robert Fernández announced in May 2016 that the player would leave the club the following month, adding he was only kept in the squad due to a transfer embargo that was to end shortly after.

On 2 July 2016, Málaga CF leaked news of the potential signing of Sandro, and their official website temporarily featured a player profile, shortly after his release from Barcelona. Five days later, they officially announced his signing on a three-year contract. He made his debut on 19 August, starting as they began the season with a 1–1 draw against CA Osasuna, and scored his first goal four weeks later to equalise in a 2–1 win over SD Eibar also at La Rosaleda.

On 8 April 2017, Sandro took his season tally to 11 after helping defeat former club Barcelona 2–0 at home, netting the first through a solo effort that started in his own half.

On 3 July 2017, Sandro signed for Everton on a four-year contract after the club triggered a £5.2 million release clause in his Málaga contract. He made his debut on 12 August, starting in a 1–0 home win against Stoke City in the Premier League. 

On 30 January 2018, Sandro joined Sevilla FC on loan for the remainder of the campaign. Exactly seven months later, in the same situation, he moved to Real Sociedad.

Sandro was a member of the Spain under-21 squad during the 2017 UEFA European Championship. He scored once for the eventual runners-up, in the 3–1 group stage win against Portugal.

Cuco Martina

Rhu-endly Aurelio Jean-Carlo "Cuco" Martina (born 25 September 1989) is a professional footballer who plays for Feyenoord on loan from Premier League club Everton. He plays primarily as a right back, but can also play as a centre back or defensive midfielder.

A youth player at Feyenoord, he began his senior career with RBC Roosendaal in the Eerste Divisie, followed by two seasons each at Eredivisie clubs RKC Waalwijk and FC Twente. In 2015, he joined Premier League club Southampton, and two years later Everton.

Born and raised in the Netherlands, he represents Curaçao at international level, for whom he is captain. First capped in 2011, he has won the 2017 Caribbean Cup, and he represented the team at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Martina was born in Rotterdam. He grew up in the south of the city with his mother, brothers and sister. Martina did not know his father, and states his elder brother was instead like a father to him. His brother Javier is also a footballer. Derwin is not related to him, despite media reports to the contrary.

Martina played youth football with Feyenoord. He spent his early senior career with RBC Roosendaal in the Eerste Divisie. In 2011, he joined RKC Waalwijk of the Eredivisie. He played 59 official matches in two seasons in North Brabant, scoring to open a 2–0 home win over N.E.C. on 8 December 2012.

On 30 July 2013, he joined FC Twente on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Martina played 59 games across all competitions for the Enschede club, scoring once: an added-time equaliser in a 2–2 home draw with Feyenoord on 23 February 2014.

He signed a two-year contract with English club Southampton on 7 July 2015. An unused substitute in the first leg, Martina made his Southampton debut in their UEFA Europa League third qualifying round second leg away to Vitesse Arnhem, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–0 win on 6 August. Three days later, he made his league debut as a half-time substitute for fellow new signing Cédric Soares in a 2–2 draw against Newcastle United. Martina became the first-ever Curaçao international to play for Southampton and the second to play in the Premier League after West Bromwich Albion's Shelton Martis in 2009.

On 26 December 2015, on his first start, Martina scored his only goal for the Saints, a long-range strike to open a 4–0 win over Arsenal. He became the first Curaçaoan to score in the Premier League. He was released by Southampton at the end of the 2016–17 season.

On 17 July 2017, following his release from Southampton, Martina joined fellow Premier League side Everton on a three-year deal, reuniting with his former Saints manager Ronald Koeman. Martina made his league debut for Everton on 12 August, when his club beat Stoke City 1–0 at Goodison Park.

Martina joined Stoke, newly relegated to the EFL Championship, on a loan for the 2018–19 season. He made his debut on 25 August, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 home win over Hull City.

Martina's loan with Stoke was cancelled on 31 January 2019, and he re-joined Feyenoord on loan for the remainder of the 2018–19 season.

Martina made his international debut for Curaçao on 9 August 2011, in their first match since the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. He played the first half of the 1–0 friendly loss to the Dominican Republic at the Estadio Panamericano in San Cristóbal, before being substituted for Kenny Kunst.

Oumar Niasse

El Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse (born 18 April 1990) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Cardiff City, on loan from Everton and the Senegal national team. 

Niasse has played top-flight football in Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Russia and England. He won the 2011 Senegal Premier League with Ouakam and scored in Lokomotiv Moscow's win in the 2015 Russian Cup Final. He signed for Everton for a £13.5 million transfer fee in 2016. Niasse made his full international debut for Senegal in 2013.

Born in Ouakam, Dakar Department, Niasse began his football career with hometown club US Ouakam in the second tier. He signed his first professional contract with Ouakam in 2008 and in the 2008–09 season helped his team win the Second League title by scoring 21 goals. Playing as a winger, Niasse also played a key role in Ouakam winning the Senegal Premier League title in 2011.

Niasse started a trial with Norwegian club Brann in February 2012, and after impressing signed for the club on a six-month loan. His time in Norway was hampered by poor form and injuries, and he returned to Senegal after playing just three Tippeligaen matches.

After a trial period with French club Saint-Étienne, Niasse was offered a contract to join the club but refused the offer. He joined the summer camp of Turkish Süper Lig club Akhisar Belediyespor and signed permanently with them in August 2013. Niasse scored on his debut in Turkey and ultimately finished the season with 15 goals.

Before the 2014–15 season, Niasse signed with Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow in July 2014 for a €5.5 million transfer fee. He scored Lokomotiv's equalising goal in the Russian Cup Final against Kuban Krasnodar on 21 May 2015 as his side went on to win 3–1 after extra time.

Niasse joined English Premier League club Everton on 1 February 2016 for a transfer fee of approximately £13.5 million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. He made his debut for the club against AFC Bournemouth on 20 February 2016, entering as an 80th-minute substitute for striker Romelu Lukaku. 

After 152 minutes of football in his first season at the club, Niasse was not given a squad number for the following 2016–17 season. He was informed by then-Everton manager Ronald Koeman he would need to search for a new club during the summer 2016 transfer window, saying, "[I]f Niasse likes to play football he needs to leave Everton." 

However, following the close of the transfer deadline for loaning and signing players in England, he was listed as part of the 25-man Everton squad for the 2016–17 season submitted on 1 September 2016 and eventually issued squad number 24. 

In October 2016, Niasse was demoted to the under-23 squad and had his personal locker revoked.

On 13 January 2017, Niasse signed a loan contract with Hull City until the end of the 2016–17 season with an option for a £10 million permanent transfer from Everton. He made his debut the next day as an 83rd-minute substitute for Abel Hernández in a 3–1 home win against AFC Bournemouth. His first goal for Hull and in English football came on 26 January in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester United, where he made his first start for the club. Hull won the second leg 2–1 but ultimately lost the tie 3–2 on aggregate. 

Niasse scored his first Premier League goal in a 2–0 victory against Liverpool on 4 February. On 11 March, he came on as a substitute against Swansea City and scored both goals in a 2–1 victory. Hull were relegated to the Championship at the end of the season and opted not to exercise its option to outright purchase Niasse.

After returning to Everton, Niasse made his first appearance since his return as a substitute in the EFL Cup third round match against Sunderland at Goodison Park on 20 September 2017, scoring Everton's third goal of a 3–0 win. Manager Ronald Koeman named Niasse in Everton's 25-man Premier League squad upon his return from loan and consequently issued him a squad number. However, Koeman omitted Niasse from Everton's UEFA Europa League squad. On 23 September, Niasse scored two goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–1 Premier League win, helping Everton to come back from a goal down. On 5 November, Niasse scored Everton's first goal in a 3–2 home win against Watford, having been losing 2–0. Thirteen days later, he scored in a 2–2 draw away to bottom side Crystal Palace. Niasse sparked controversy in the match by appearing to dive to win Everton a penalty, which was converted by Leighton Baines to make the score 1–1 in the first half. He subsequently became the first Premier League player to be charged with "successful deception of a match official" under The Football Association's new regulations. Everton appealed the verdict, but the FA rejected the appeal and Niasse received a two-match suspension.

On 18 January 2019, Niasse joined fellow Premier League team Cardiff City on loan for the remainder of the season.

Niasse was first selected for the Senegal national team in January 2013 as part of an all domestic-based squad. He made his debut on 15 January, starting in a 2–1 friendly loss to Chile in La Serena.

On 25 May 2015, Niasse scored his first international goals, a brace in a 3–1 win over Kosovo at the Stade de Genève.

His brother Ibrahima Niasse is also a professional footballer.

Muhamed Bešić

Muhamed Bešić (; born 10 September 1992) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Championship club Middlesbrough, on loan from Everton, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.

Bešić started his professional career at Hamburger SV, playing mainly in its reserve team, before moving to Ferencváros in 2012. Two years later he joined Everton. He was loaned to Middlesbrough in 2018.

A former youth international for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bešić made his senior international debut in 2010, and is the youngest player ever to represent the country. He made over 30 caps since and represented the nation at their first major tournament, the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Born in Berlin to Bosnian parents, Bešić joined local club TB Berlin at the age of 14, where he remained until he was 16, when he signed for Hamburger SV. On 4 November 2010, Bešić signed his first professional contract with Hamburger SV until June 2013. He made his professional debut in Bundesliga game against Borussia Dortmund on 12 November 2010 at the age of 18. Bešić came on as a substitute in the 80th minute when Dortmund was already leading 2–0. A week later, he started his first Bundesliga game away at Hannover 96, and played full 90 minutes in a 3–2 loss.

In March 2012, Bešić was suspended from the first team, due to lack of discipline. Bosnian media also claimed that manager Thorsten Fink "strangled" Bešić and threw him out of the dressing room.

In 2012 Bešić was signed by Hungarian club Ferencváros on free transfer. He scored his first and only goal for the club in an away victory over Paksi, which was also his first professional goal. In his first season, he helped the team win Ligakupa by beating MOL Vidi in the final.

In July 2013, Bešić prolonged his contract with Ferencváros until 2016.

On 28 July 2014 Bešić signed a five-year contract with Everton for an undisclosed fee, speculated to be in the region of £4 million. Having been an unused substitute in the first two games of the season, he made his first Premier League appearance on 30 August against Chelsea, replacing Romelu Lukaku in the 89th minute; however he made a defensive error which allowed opponent Diego Costa to score the final goal in a 3–6 home defeat. Bešić made his first start for Everton in the Merseyside derby on 27 September, being substituted after 80 minutes for Samuel Eto'o as the game ended in a 1–1 away draw.

His second season at Everton was plagued by hamstring injuries, which limited his appearances and playing time. In February 2016 he was voted Everton's Player of the Month for January. He also extended his contract until June 2021.

In August 2016, Bešić was ruled out for about six month as he tore anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Bešić was slowly making his way back to full fitness as he was involved with Everton Under-23s' in mid-April 2017. He missed the whole 2016–17 campaign, not playing a single minute for Everton, before eventually returning to action coming on as a 77th-minute substitute for his national team on 9 June 2017.

Bešić returned to Premier League action on 21 August 2017, almost 16 months since his last game, in a 1–1 away draw at Manchester City.

After falling out of favor at Everton, in January 2018, Bešić joined Championship club Middlesbrough on loan until the end of the season. He debuted on 17 February against Cardiff City. Bešić scored his first goal for Middlesbrough, which was also his first goal in over four years, against Derby County on 21 April.

Bešić returned to Middlesbrough on a season-long loan in August 2018.

Bešić claimed in an interview that he had declined an offer to play for Germany, because he only wished to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was first part of Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21 side.

On 5 November 2010, Bešić was called-up to the senior team by Safet Sušić for friendly game against Slovakia. He made his debut in that match, thereby becoming the youngest player to ever play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at senior level. The record was previously held by Miralem Pjanić.

Bešić was selected to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, country's first ever major competition. He made his tournament debut in the opening group game, which ended in a narrow loss to Argentina at the Maracanã Stadium,

He was given a straight red card on 6 September 2015, in a 3–0 home win over Andorra in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying game for throwing his chewing gum at Víctor Rodríguez, who was also sent off for retaliating.

During his career, Bešić has been deployed as a right back and as a centre back, although his natural position by his own words is defensive midfielder.

He was described in 2014 by Everton manager Roberto Martínez as a "very complete footballer", who "has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he's a technical player on the ball."

Bešić has many tattoos, his first being the word "Bosanac" (Bosnian). Some of many are also names of his parents and brother. He is a Muslim; along with international team mates Vedad Ibišević and Edin Višća he visited a mosque in Cuiabá during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 4 July 2013, he became the Bosnian ambassador for the Emmaus charity organisation.

Bešić has two daughters with his long-time girlfriend Jessica.

Nikola Vlašić

Nikola Vlašić (; born 4 October 1997) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Russian Premier League club PFC CSKA Moscow on loan from Everton and the Croatia national team.

In 2014, Vlašić made list of the world's top 40 footballers born in 1997, compiled by "The Guardian".

Born in Split to the family of the athletics coach Joško Vlašić, as the younger brother of the world champion high jumper Blanka Vlašić, Nikola's future football career was viewed as a "project" by his father, who started training him personally ever since he was four years old.

Vlašić went on to join the NK Omladinac Vranjic academy, before he was brought to HNK Hajduk Split, aged 12. He made his debut for the Croatia U16 national football team at the age of 14, playing regularly with older teammates at U17 and U18 levels as well. He excelled at youth club level as well, and in the 2013–2014 season he formed a potent midfield partnership for the Hajduk U17 team with Andrija Balić, which resulted in the team finishing the first half of the season in first place, without a single loss. The two then received and signed professional contracts, and were moved to the U19 team, where he played regularly.

He made his first team debut in the UEFA Europa League qualifying match on 17 July 2014, playing in the away match against Dundalk F.C.. Scoring on his debut, he became Hajduk Split's youngest scorer in international competitions, aged 16 years and 9 months, 2 months less than the previous record holder Mario Tičinović. That season, Vlašić went on to make 37 appearances in all competitions, scoring four goals.

On 30 June 2016, Hajduk announced that Vlašić had been appointed vice-captain of the club, with Lovre Kalinić continuing to be the captain. As Kalinić was on extended holidays as a result of being part of the Croatian squad at UEFA Euro 2016, Vlašić captained Hajduk for the first time on 14 July 2016, the season opening fixture; a 2–2 away draw against CS Municipal Studențesc Iași in the second round of the 2016–17 Europa League qualifying phase. Despite his tender age, Vlašić would captain the side four further times that season.

On 31 August 2017, Vlašić signed a five-year deal with Premier League club Everton for a fee of around £10m, the highest fee Hajduk Split have ever received. Vlašić impressed Everton manager Ronald Koeman and director of football Steve Walsh when Everton and Hajduk faced each other in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League play-off round. Vlasic scored his first goal for Everton on his debut at Goodison Park to put Everton ahead against Apollon Limassol in the Europa League, in the 66th minute on 28 September 2017.

On 15 August 2018, Russian club PFC CSKA Moscow announced that Vlašić joined them on loan for the 2018–19 season. On 2 October 2018 Vlašić scored the winning goal against title holders Real Madrid on the 2nd minute in the 2018/19 UCL.

On 28 May 2017. Vlašić made his debut with Croatia in a friendly match against Mexico after being named in the starting line-up.

On 18 November 2018, he provided an assist to Andrej Kramarić in a UEFA Nations League match against England for a 0-1 lead, which Croatia eventually lost 2-1.

He is the brother of Croatian athlete Blanka Vlašić.

Luke Garbutt

Luke Samuel Garbutt (born 21 May 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Oxford United, on loan from Everton.

Born in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, Garbutt attended Harrogate Grammar School where he played in the Year 7 School Football team that reached the Harrogate and District Cup Final in 2005. His impressive performances for his junior club team, Pannal Ash Juniors, saw him signed by Leeds United where he began his professional career. Shortly after leaving school, he was signed from their academy by Everton in 2009, for an initial fee of £600,000 which was set by a tribunal as the two clubs could not agree a fee. He was loaned to Cheltenham Town during the 2011–12 season.

In the 2012–13 season Garbutt made his Everton debut, coming on at half-time during a 5–0 League Cup second-round win over Leyton Orient on 29 August 2012.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Garbutt signed a new two-year contract with Everton, and during the season went to Colchester United on loan.

Garbutt made his Premier League debut as a late substitute at Southampton in April 2014 and built on that with his first appearance for England's Under-21s in a 3–1 European Championship qualifying win over Wales the following month.

In September 2011 he joined Cheltenham Town on an initial one-month loan deal. He made his professional debut as Cheltenham beat Wycombe Wanderers 3–1 on 4 October 2011 in the Football League Trophy.

Garbutt was part of the starting 11 in both legs of the Europa League round of 16 tie against Swiss side BSC Young Boys in February, Everton progressing 7–2 on aggregate. This was the beginning of an extended run in the first team for Garbutt, starting in the following Premier League game against Arsenal, taking advantage of an injury to regular left-back Leighton Baines to maintain his place in the starting 11.

On 30 June 2015, Everton announced that Garbutt had signed new five-year deal with the club.

Kevin Mirallas

Kevin Antonio Joel Gislain Mirallas y Castillo (born 5 October 1987), more commonly known as Kevin Mirallas (), is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Fiorentina on loan from Everton and the Belgium national team.

Mirallas started his professional career in France with Lille and Saint-Étienne before moving to Greece with Olympiacos in 2010. Mirallas enjoyed success during his time at Olympiacos scoring 34 goals in 52 league games, including being the league's top scorer in his second season with 20 goals in 25 games. His impressive performances attracted the attention of Everton who signed him in the summer of 2012 for £6 million.

Mirallas has over 50 caps for Belgium since his senior debut in 2007. He has represented Belgium at various youth levels and has featured for them at senior level at the 2008 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup; the latter of which he helped his team reach the quarter-final.

Mirallas spent his youth career playing for his hometown club Standard Liège. He then left Belgium and began his first team career in France by signing for Lille OSC and played for them since the opening of the 2004–05 season. Mirallas participated in the UEFA Cup in his first season at the club. Mirallas subsequently was transferred to AS Saint-Étienne for €4 million, and began to make a name for himself by scoring against Lyon on his debut in the Rhone-Loire derby.

In June 2010 Mirallas joined Greek club Olympiacos on a one-year loan for a fee of €2.5 million. Mirallas made his debut in a 5–0 win against KS Besa Kavaje in the Second Qualifying Round of the UEFA Europa League Qualifiers and scored his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 home win against Olympiakos Volos. Mirallas scored in a 2–1 away loss to their greatest rivals Panathinaikos in the Derby of the eternal enemies after which his contract was extended to four years. Olympiacos won that season's Greek Super League and Mirallas finished as the club's top scorer with 14 goals, with only Panathinaikos's Djibril Cissé scoring more league goals than him. The following season Mirallas scored his first ever hat-trick for Olympiacos in a 4–0 away win against Levadiakos F.C. and scored four in a 7–2 victory over Asteras Tripolis. Olympiacos again won the league, and Mirallas was the league's top scorer with 20 goals.

In August 2012, Mirallas joined Premier League club Everton for a reported fee of £6 million. He made his debut as a second-half substitute during a 3–1 league win over Aston Villa at Villa Park in which he had a headed goal disallowed due to it being ruled offside. In his first start four days later, Mirallas scored twice and provided two assists as Everton won 5–0 against Leyton Orient in the second round of the League Cup. He scored his first league goal on 22 September 2012, in a 3–0 away win against Swansea City after heading in his initial effort which rebounded off the underside of the bar. Mirallas suffered a number of injuries which limited his number of appearances during the middle part of the season. He made a number of brief cameos, notably against Tottenham Hotspur in December. Mirallas' next goal came against Oldham Athletic in a 3–1 win on 26 February 2013 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. He then scored again, scoring his second league goal of the season against Reading in a 3–1 win on 2 March 2013. He scored his first brace in David Moyes' last home game in charge of Everton in a 2–0 win against West Ham United.

Mirallas scored and assisted a goal during a 3–3 draw in the first Merseyside derby of the 2013–14 season on 23 November. He also received a booking for a high challenge on Luis Suárez which opposing manager Brendan Rodgers described as reckless and insisted Mirallas was lucky to remain on the pitch. He went on to score eight goals in the season, before it was ended in April due to a groin injury. Mirallas created 61 chances for his teammates during the season, the most of any Everton player.

On 18 September 2014, Mirallas scored his first European goal for Everton, in a 4–1 win over Wolfsburg in the first match of their Europa League campaign. He signed a new three-year contract with the club in August 2015.

Mirallas scored his 29th Premier League goals for Everton on 11 March 2017 as Everton cruised to victory over West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park in a 3–0 win. On 12 May 2017, Mirallas signed a new three-year contract deal with Everton until the end of June 2020.

On 7 January 2018, Mirallas agreed to return to former club Olympiacos on loan until the end of the 2017–18 season. The club did not have an option to purchase Mirallas as part of the contract. On 16 April, Mirallas scored a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty area on the stroke of half-time in a 5–1 home win against Kerkyra. On 4 May, his loan spell was terminated by mutual consent due to Everton's high asking price to purchase Mirallas outright, as well as Mirallas' overall sub-par performances with Olympiacos.

On 4 August 2018, Mirallas signed for Fiorentina on a season-long loan deal with the option to make the transfer permanent.

Mirallas has represented Belgium at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level, and was one of the leading figures in guiding the under-21s to the semi-finals of the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

He scored twice in the 2008 Summer Olympics football tournament, once against China (2–0 victory) and once against Italy (3–2 victory).
He made his full international debut for the senior team in 2007 and scored his first ever international goal against Serbia in Brussels on 23 August of that year, as a Mousa Dembélé brace helped the Red Devils to a 3–2 home victory.

Mirallas was part of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his tournament debut in the second group match, a 1–0 win over Russia in the Maracanã, as a 75th-minute substitute for Dries Mertens. In a game of few opportunities, Mirallas hit the post with Belgium's first shot on target, with another substitute Divock Origi scoring the only goal two minutes from full-time.

In May 2018 he was left out of Belgium’s preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Mirallas was deployed as a centre forward for Olympiacos but since his move to Everton he has been deployed mainly as a winger or a free roaming forward. He is known for his pace, close ball control, passing ability and proficiency in one-on-one situations.

Mirallas' father was born in Spain.
