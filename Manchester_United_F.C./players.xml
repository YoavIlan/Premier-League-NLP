'''David de Gea Quintana''' ({{IPA-es|daˈβið ðe ˈxea kinˈtana}}; born 7 November 1990) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]].

Born in [[Madrid]], De Gea began his career aged 13 with [[Atlético Madrid]] and rose through the academy system at the club before making his senior debut in 2009. After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, he helped the team win both the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]] and the [[2010 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] in 2010. His performances attracted the attention of Manchester United, which he joined in June 2011 for £18.9&amp;nbsp;million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.

Since joining United, De Gea has made over 300 appearances and won a Premier League title, an [[2016 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], a [[2016–17 EFL Cup|League Cup]], three [[FA Community Shield|Community Shields]] and the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]]. For three consecutive seasons from [[2013–14 Manchester United F.C. season|2013–14]] to [[2015–16 Manchester United F.C. season|2015–16]], he was elected as United's [[Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year]], the first player in the award's history to win on three successive occasions (four in total),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/POTY-Manchester-United-goalkeeper-David-De-Gea-named-Sir-Matt-Busby-Player-of-the-Year-for-2015-16|title=DAVID DE GEA WINS THIRD SUCCESSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARD |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503233049/http://www.manutd.com/en/MatchTrackerSeasons/2015-16/United-Today-Live-Blog/2015-16/May-2016/Player-of-the-Year-Awards-2015-16.aspx |archive-date=3 May 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being included in four consecutive (five in total) [[PFA Team of the Year]] sides from 2015 to 2018. In 2018 he was named in the [[FIFPro#FIFA FIFPro World XI|FIFA FIFPro World XI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifpro.org/news/de-gea-kante-mbappe-in-world-11/en/|title=De Gea, Kante and Mbappé in World 11|website=FIFPro World Players' Union|date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gea was the captain for the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain under-21]] national team that won the European Championship in [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2011]] and [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2013]], and also competed in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]]. He made his debut for the senior team in 2014 and was selected for [[2014 FIFA World Cup|that year's World Cup]]. He was tipped by many to become the successor to [[Iker Casillas]] as Spain's long-term goalkeeper,&lt;ref name="Future"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Jenson |title=David De Gea has finally come of age and looks the future for both Spain and Manchester United |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/pete-jenson-david-de-gea-has-finally-come-of-age-and-looks-the-future-for-both-spain-and-manchester-united-9796962.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also is regarded to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.&lt;ref name="best in the world"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11295641/Wayne-Rooney-Man-Utd-can-win-title-with-best-in-world-David-de-Gea.html |title=Wayne Rooney: Man Utd can win title with 'best in world' David de Gea|publisher=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |last=Ogden |first=Mark|date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="best in the world 2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11294620/David-de-Geas-performance-sparks-best-goalkeeper-in-the-world-debate-but-who-would-you-vote-for.html |title=David de Gea's performance sparks 'best goalkeeper in the world' debate|publisher=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=15 December 2014|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="best in the world 3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dreamteamfc.com/c/news-gossip/428324/david-de-gea-save-chelsea-man-united-juan-mata-2012/|title=STICKY Reliving the exact moment David De Gea went from Man United flop to world class superstar|website= Dream Team FC|date=18 October 2018|accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Atlético Madrid===
[[File:David de Gea.jpg|thumb|upright|left|De Gea playing for [[Atlético Madrid]] in 2010]]
====Youth and Atlético B====
Born in [[Madrid]] and raised in [[Illescas, Toledo|Illescas]],&lt;ref name="Illescas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hidalgo |first=Dani |url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2009/10/05/mas_futbol/1254724047_850215.html |title=Un Illescas orgulloso se volcó con De Gea |trans-title=A proud Illescas turned to De Gea |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2014 |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gea joined [[Atlético Madrid]] at the age of 13 when his then-coach Juan Luis Martín lied to the club that [[Rayo Vallecano]] were set to sign him. A few days later, [[Diego Díaz Garrido]] scouted De Gea and signed him immediately.&lt;ref name="Illescas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Casáñez |first=Juan |url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2009/10/09/mas_futbol/1255069658_850215.html |title=Mentí al Atlético para que fichara a De Gea |trans-title=I lied to bring Atletico De Gea |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his way up through the youth ranks at the club before signing his first professional contract in 2008, aged 17, contracting him to Atlético until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2008/03/11/mas_futbol/1205190021_850215.html |title=De Gea firma contrato profesional con el Atlético hasta 2011 |trans-title=De Gea signs professional contract with Atletico until 2011 |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his second season for [[Atlético Madrid B]] in [[Segunda División B]]. In the summer of 2009, De Gea was approached by [[CD Numancia|Numancia]] and English team [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] with regards to a loan move, with Atlético sporting director [[Jesús García Pitarch]] pushing for him to move to Numancia. De Gea rejected the approach, and was punished by being forced to train by himself.&lt;ref name="DeGeaProfile"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitten |first=Andy |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2200204/in-form-david-de-gea-embodies-manchester-uniteds-upturn-in-fortunes-by-andy-mitten |title=In-form David De Gea embodies Man United's upturn in fortunes |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, Atlético manager [[Abel Resino]] noticed De Gea training alone and invited him to train with the first team, where he was rated as the third-choice goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="DeGeaProfile"/&gt; The same summer, Atlético rejected an offer from English team [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for a permanent transfer for De Gea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2009/09/01/futbol/equipos/atletico/1251833694.html |title=De Gea rechazó una oferta del Wigan |trans-title=De Gea rejected an offer from Wigan |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10 season: First team call up====
With first-choice goalkeeper [[Sergio Asenjo]] away on international duty at the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], De Gea was called up to the senior team as cover for [[Roberto Jiménez Gago|Roberto]]. He made his debut for the Atlético first-team at the age of 18 on 30 September 2009, coming on as a substitute after Roberto was injured after 27 minutes of Atlético's [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage|UEFA Champions League Group stage]] match away to [[FC Porto|Porto]]; De Gea conceded two late goals as Atlético lost 2–0.&lt;ref name="whirlwind"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Bryan |title=De Gea stands tall after whirlwind bow |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=901256.html |publisher=UEFA |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto's injury meant that De Gea was given his [[La Liga]] debut three days later, at home to [[Real Zaragoza]]; he gave away a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in the 19th minute, but immediately redeemed himself by saving [[Marko Babić (footballer)|Marko Babić]]'s attempt in an eventual 2–1 win.&lt;ref name="whirlwind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2009/10/04/futbol/equipos/atletico/1254610675.html |title=De Gea: "Empezar aquí parando un penalti ha sido un sueño" |trans-title=De Gea: "Starting here by stopping a penalty has been a dream" |date=14 October 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described starting at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium]] as a "dream since childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2009/10/01/futbol/equipos/atletico/1254407242.html |title=De Gea: "Debutar en el Calderón es mi sueño desde pequeño" |trans-title=De Gea: "Start at the Calderon is my dream since childhood" |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, De Gea was touted as a possible replacement for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]], who was set to retire in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2010/01/24/futbol/equipos/atletico/1264325881.html |title=La prensa inglesa sitúa a De Gea en el radar del Manchester United |trans-title=The British press puts De Gea on the radar of Manchester United |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, however, he signed a new contract which would keep him with Atlético until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Molina |first=Francisco |url=http://www.marca.com/2010/01/28/futbol/equipos/atletico/1264696302.html |title=De Gea, hasta 2013 de rojiblanco |trans-title=De Gea, Atletico until 2013 |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some costly mistakes by Asenjo, and the arrival of [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] as manager, De Gea finished the [[2009–10 Atlético Madrid season|2009–10 season]] as the starting "number one". He won two [[man of the match]] awards along the way,&lt;ref name="factfile"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12040_7007619,00.html |title=De Gea factfile |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Athletic Bilbao]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Additionally, he appeared in eight matches in the club's [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|victorious]] [[UEFA Europa League]] campaign, including the 2–1 [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|final win]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8675486.stm |title=Atletico Madrid 2–1 Fulham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diego Forlán]] later said of his first season, "David was good enough for the top level at 19 and the players had confidence in him."&lt;ref name="DeGeaProfile"/&gt;

De Gea started [[2010–11 Atlético Madrid season|2010–11]] in impressive fashion, helping Atlético win [[2010 UEFA Super Cup|the season]]'s [[UEFA Super Cup]]. In the 90th minute of the 2–0 win against [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], he saved a [[Diego Milito]] penalty kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Slick Atlético seal Super Cup success |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/matches/season=2010/round=2000123/match=2002327/postmatch/report/index.html |publisher=UEFA |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, it was reported that Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] had missed a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] to travel to Spain to watch De Gea in action against Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/826143/man-united-linked-with-de-gea-after-ferguson-misses-cup-clash |title=United linked with De Gea after Fergie misses cup clash |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/2010/09/23/futbol/equipos/atletico/1285237907.html |title=Ferguson espió a De Gea |trans-title=Ferguson spied on De Gea |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |newspaper=Marca|location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gea played down the rumours, saying, "The important thing is that I have a contract here and I'm an Atletico player until 2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/47713.html |title=De Gea not thinking about Manchester United move |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his "faultless" performance in the [[Madrid Derby]] on 7 November, De Gea was hailed as the heir apparent to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]] for [[Spain national football team|Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Train |first=Rob |url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/blog/_/name/train_rob/id/5791196/spain-very-good-hands |title=Spain is in very good hands |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment Casillas agreed with, saying, "In Spain we are lucky to have very good goalkeepers and De Gea soon might be fighting my place in the team," while Spain manager [[Vicente del Bosque]] described De Gea as "the future of the team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Del Estal |first=Sandra |url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2010/11/05/mas_futbol/1288911641_850215.html |title=Casillas: "De Gea peleará pronto por mi puesto" |trans-title=Casillas: "De Gea will fight soon in my position" |date=5 November 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the undisputed starting goalkeeper for the remainder of the season, going on to play in every La Liga match for the team en route to a seventh-place finish.

During his time with Atlético Madrid, De Gea shared a locker with [[Cléber Santana]], who died aboard [[LaMia Flight 2933]] on the way to the first-leg of the [[2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davie |first=Chris |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/29/david-de-gea-pays-tribute-to-former-team-mate-cleber-santana-killed-in-plane-crash-6290378/ |title=David De Gea pays tribute to former team-mate Cleber Santana killed in plane crash |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=19 December 2016 |newspaper=Metro |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Labile Pogba''' (born 15 March 1993) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[France national football team|French national team]]. He operates primarily as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], but can also be deployed as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], and [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]].&lt;ref name="Paul Pogba (Manchester United FC)"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guineefoot.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=343:paul-pogba-le-havre-ac&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50 |title=Paul Pogba (Manchester United FC) |website=Guineefoot.info |language=French |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Lagny-sur-Marne]], Pogba showed much promise as a youngster, flourishing as a member of local youth teams. He eventually joined the youth team of [[Ligue 1]] side [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], before a protracted transfer brought him to Manchester United in 2009. After beginning his senior career with Manchester United two years later, limited appearances persuaded him to depart to join Italian side [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a free transfer in 2012, where he helped the club to four consecutive [[Serie A]] titles, as well as two [[Coppa Italia]] and two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles. During his time in Italy, Pogba further established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world, and received the [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy]] award in 2013, followed by the [[Bravo Award]] in 2014. In 2016, Pogba was named to the [[UEFA Team of the Year#Team of the Year 2015|2015 UEFA Team of the Year]], as well as the [[FIFPro#FIFA FIFPro World XI|2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI]], after helping Juventus to the [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final]], their first in 12 years.

Pogba's performances at Juventus allowed him to return to Manchester United in 2016 for a then-[[List of most expensive association football transfers|world record transfer fee]] of €105&amp;nbsp;million (£89.3&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-italia.net/88963/official-pogba-signs-man-utd |title=Official: Pogba signs for Man Utd for €105m |website=Football Italia |publisher=Tiro Media |date=8 August 2016 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee paid for him remains the highest paid by an English club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/09/paul-pogba-completes-man-utd-transfer-for-world-record-fee/ |title=Pogba Completes Utd Move |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=8 August 2016 |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season back, he won the [[2017 EFL Cup Final|League Cup]] and the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manutd.com/en/players-and-staff/detail/paul-pogba&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, he captained France to victory at the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and took home the award for the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Best Player]] for his performances during the tournament. He made his debut for the [[French national football team|senior team]] a year later, and featured prominently at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], where he was awarded the [[2014 FIFA World Cup awards#Best Young Player|Best Young Player Award]] for his performances. He later represented his nation at [[UEFA Euro 2016]] on home soil, where he finished as a runner-up, before winning the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] after scoring in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].

==Early life==
Pogba was born in [[Lagny-sur-Marne]], Seine-et-Marne, to Guinean parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/03/france-paul-pogba-brazil-world-cup-germany |title=France's Paul Pogba: a complete midfielder worth 'two Gareth Bales' |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/e25557ac-e76b-435f-9bfa-b069230fc68b |title=How hard is it to be a Muslim footballer during Ramadan? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/12/france-has-problem-with-islam-and-there-is-too-much-unwanted-imm/ |title=France has 'problem with Islam' and there is 'too much unwanted immigration', says Hollande in explosive book |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 October 2016 |accessdate=18 October 2016 |first=Henry |last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/09/12/27358822/is-pogba-a-muslim-how-tall-is-ibrahimovic-your-manchester-united |title=Is Pogba a Muslim?

Pogba began his football career at the age of six playing for US Roissy-en-Brie, a few miles south of his hometown. He spent seven seasons at the club before joining US Torcy, where he served as captain of the club's under-13 team.&lt;ref name="pogba_torcy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 'vole Paul POGBA' au HAC |url=http://torcyfoot.footeo.com/actualite/2009/07/31/manchester-united-vole-paul-pogba-au-hac.html |language=French |publisher=US Torcy |via=Footeo |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After one season with Torcy, Pogba joined professional club [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]]. In his second season at the club, Pogba captained its under-16 team to the final phase of its domestic league, the ''Championnat National des 16 ans''. Le Havre finished second to [[RC Lens|Lens]] in the final group phase, finishing ahead of the likes of [[Olympique Lyonnais Reserves and Academy|Lyon]] and [[AS Nancy|Nancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/champ/autres_championnats/529088.shtml |title=Dernière journée des demi-finales |date=29 May 2009 |publisher=French Football Federation |accessdate=23 April 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724173355/http://www.fff.fr/champ/autres_championnats/529088.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pogba also established himself as a youth international for his country.

====Transfer====
{{Quote box |width=30% |align=left |quote= "The player [Pogba] and his parents refused to keep the arrangement because Manchester United offered very high sums of money to the parents of the [player] with the aim of obtaining the transfer of their son." |source= &lt;small&gt;[[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]]'s response to Pogba's decision to join [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref name="pogba_departure"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd deny 'stealing' youngster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8180042.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/small&gt; }}

On 31 July 2009, Pogba announced that he was departing Le Havre to join the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth academy]] of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in England. The move surprised his parent club, as it allegedly had a "non-solicitation agreement" with Pogba, which was agreed to by not only the player but also his parents in 2006. The agreement, which was in place until the end of the [[2009–10 in French football|2009–10 season]], allowed Le Havre to sign Pogba to an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract once the player met specific age and scholarship requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=United leave Le Havre fuming |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_5465427,00.html |date=1 August 2009 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August, Le Havre released an official statement on its website criticising Manchester United and the Pogba family.&lt;ref name="pogba_departure"/&gt; Le Havre also announced its intent to ask [[FIFA]] to probe the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/04/paul-pogba-fifa-manchester-united-le-havre |title=Fifa denies receiving complaint over Paul Pogba's Manchester United deal |date=4 September 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Le Havre's accusations, Manchester United threatened to sue the club, while Pogba denied he was leaving Le Havre for monetary reasons, which Le Havre President Jean-Pierre Louvel had alleged to be £87,000 and a house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd threaten to sue Le Havre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8242430.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=United's class of 2011 could be the next Busby Babes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/uniteds-class-of-2011-could-be-the-next-busby-babes-2288498.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Havre was also accused by Pogba's former club Torcy of using the same tactics it purported Manchester United to have used when the club acquired Pogba from its youth academy. On the same day of Pogba's announcement to depart for England, Torcy released a press release on its official website criticising Le Havre's accusations, stating, "We will not use the term 'steal,' but the recruiters of Le Havre acted the same way with the club in Torcy." The club cited Le Havre's acceptance of allowing Pogba to sign an amateur licence with the club without notifying Torcy as its primary reason why.&lt;ref name="pogba_torcy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le Havre et Manchester United se déchirent pour un prodige francilien |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/iledefrance/le-havre-et-manchester-united-se-dechirent-pour-un-prodige-francilien-05-09-2009-628259.php |newspaper=Le Parisien |location=Paris |date=5 September 2009 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October, Manchester United were cleared of wrongdoing by a judge appointed by FIFA, with the declaration that Pogba was not contractually linked to Le Havre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2009/Oct/Pogba-deal-approved.aspx |title=Pogba deal approved |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having the option to appeal, on 18 June 2010, Le Havre officials confirmed that the club had reached an agreement with Manchester United for the transfer of Pogba. The terms of the agreement were confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Jun/Reds-reach-Pogba-agreement.aspx |title=Reds reach Pogba agreement |date=17 June 2010 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-united-reach-agreement-over-pogba-2004018.html |title=Manchester United reach agreement over Pogba |date=18 June 2010 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, he was called up to the club's [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] and made his debut on 2 November 2010 in a 3–1 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Reserves: Bolton 1 United 3 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2010/Nov/Reserves-Bolton-1-United-3.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2011, in the [[2010–11 FA Youth Cup|FA Youth Cup]], Pogba scored a long-range goal, described as a "piledriver," in the team's 3–2 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].

==International career==
===Youth===
[[File:Pogba (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Pogba with France in the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]]

Pogba began his international career for France with the [[France national youth football team|national youth football team]] and earned caps at all levels for which he was eligible. Prior to his international debut, Pogba was named [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the under-16 team by coach Guy Ferrier. He made his youth international debut on 23 September 2008 in the team's opening match of the campaign against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in [[Llanelli]]. France won the match 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Début de parcours victorieux (4–2) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/actualite/463979.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pogba's leadership, the team recorded impressive victories over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the Tournoi du [[Val-de-Marne]], and defeated the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] by a combined score of 8–2 over the course of two matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Première victoire contre l'Uruguay (2–0) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/actualite/473168.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Victoire face à l'Italie (4–0) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/actualite/474346.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier succès face à l'Irlande (3–0) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/actualite/528183.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deuxième victoire tricolore (5–2) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/actualite/528198.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2009, he scored his first youth international goal in the 2009 Aegean Cup Final against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].

Mankowski had previously been the assistant manager of the [[France national football team|senior national team]] under the reign of [[Raymond Domenech]]. Pogba made his under-18 debut on 27 October 2010 at the Tournio de Limoges against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Festival offensif pour débuter (4–1) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/535426.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 2011, Pogba scored his first goal with the team netting the game-winning goal in a 2–1 win over [[Germany national under-18 football team|Germany]].

Pogba made his debut with the [[France national under-19 football team|under-19 team]] in its first match of the season against [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italy]] on 6 September 2011. In the match, he assisted on two goals, scored by [[Jean-Christophe Bahebeck]] and [[Anthony Koura]], in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier succès face aux Italiens (3–1) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m19ans/actualite/539077_premier-succes-face-aux-italiens-3-1 |publisher=French Football Federation |date=6 September 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 February 2012, he scored his first goal for the team in a 2–1 defeat to [[Spain national under-19 football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Espagne s'impose à Meaux (2–1) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m19ans/actualite/541047_l-espagne-s-impose-a-meaux-2-1 |publisher=French Football Federation |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship elite qualification|Elite Round qualification]] for the [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]], Pogba scored the fifth goal in the team's 6–0 rout of the [[Netherlands national under-19 football team|Netherlands]].

In the team's opening group stage match against [[Serbia national under-19 football team|Serbia]], he converted a penalty in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=France in cruise control against Serbia |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2012/matches/round=2000210/match=2010333/index.html |publisher=UEFA |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; France reached the semi-finals where the team faced Spain. In the match, with France trailing 3–2 in [[extra time]], Pogba scored the equalising goal three minutes prior to the match's completion to send it to [[Penalty shootout|penalties]]. However, despite Pogba converting the opening penalty for France, ''Les Bleuets'' were defeated 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spain finally see off France in semi-final shoot-out |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2012/matches/round=2000211/match=2010326/index.html |publisher=UEFA |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the under-19 team's semi-final appearance in the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, the nation qualified for the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], which merited [[France national under-20 football team|under-20 team]] appearances for Pogba. Similar to the previous two seasons, Pogba was installed as captain by Mankowski and made his under-20 debut in a 0–0 draw against [[China national under-20 football team|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Match nul face à la Chine (0–0) |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/20ans/actualite/543073_match-nul-face-a-la-chine-0-0 |publisher=French Football Federation |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's next match against [[North Korea national under-20 football team|North Korea]], Pogba scored the team's second goal in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La France domine la Corée du Nord |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/20ans/actualite/543107_la-france-domine-la-coree-du-nord |publisher=French Football Federation |date=9 September 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pogba was the captain of the team that won France's first ever [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. In that tournament held in [[Turkey]], he played every minute of all of France's matches except for the final group match against Spain, in which he was an unused substitute. He was named the best player of the tournament.&lt;ref name="Pogba meilleur joueur"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Pogba-designe-meilleur-joueur/385672 |title=Paul Pogba désigné meilleur joueur|trans-title=Paul Pogba elected best player |newspaper=L'Équipe |location=Paris |language=French |date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez''' ({{IPA-es|aˈleksis ˈsantʃes}}; born 19 December 1988), also known simply as '''Alexis''', is a Chilean professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for English {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Chile national football team|Chile national team]].

Sánchez began his career as a youth player for [[C.D. Cobreloa|Cobreloa]] at age 17, completing a season at the club before relocating to Italy to play for [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in 2006. He won his first trophies in the following seasons, winning consecutive league titles in loans spells to [[Colo-Colo]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]. In 2008, he returned to Udinese, becoming an integral member of the team in his first full season at the club. After three seasons in Italy, Sánchez moved to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in a transfer worth €30&amp;nbsp;million (£25&amp;nbsp;million), becoming the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive Chilean player of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Los traspasos más caros de Chilenos |url=http://www.superdt.cl/futbol-internacional/fotos-conoce-los-traspasos-de-futbolistas-chilenos-mas-caros |accessdate=21 July 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Barcelona, Sánchez starred in an attacking trio alongside [[Lionel Messi]] and [[David Villa]], helping the club win the [[Copa del Rey]], [[Supercopa de España]], [[UEFA Super Cup]], and [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. The trio scored a total of 82 goals the following season, as the club won the [[2012–13 La Liga]], as well as retaining the Supercopa de España, before Sánchez enjoyed his highest scoring return at the ''Blaugrana'', ending the season with a total of 21 goals, and 14 assists. Following the high-profile arrival of [[Neymar]] in 2013, Sánchez transferred to Premier League side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a deal worth £31.7&amp;nbsp;million (€35.8&amp;nbsp;million) a year later.

At Arsenal, Sánchez quickly established himself as the figurehead of the team, completing every season in England with double figures in both goals and assists. He also won the [[FA Community Shield]], as well as the [[FA Cup]] on two occasions, scoring in both finals. In the [[2016–17 Arsenal F.C. season|2016–17 season]], Sánchez scored 30 goals and provided 14 assists, his best return as a professional footballer, while going onto being nominated for the [[FIFPro|FIFPro World XI]]. However, after lacking "inspiration" at the direction of the club, he signed for rivals Manchester United in a swap deal in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/alexis-sanchez-manchester-united-arsenal-transfer-news-parting-shot-instagram-message-revealed-a8172956.html |title=Sanchez takes parting shot at Arsenal critics before completing move |date=22 January 2018 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Cobreloa===
[[File:Alexis Sanchez Cobreloa20171.png|thumb|120px|upright|Sánchez in [[C.D. Cobreloa|Cobreloa]] colours, 2017]]
Born in [[Tocopilla]], Sánchez was a product of [[C.D. Cobreloa]]'s prolific youth ranks where he was teammate of current Chile national team players such as [[Charles Aránguiz]] and [[Eduardo Vargas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Calama: El recuerdo de 6 seleccionados que jugaron en Cobreloa |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2012/05/31/543228/el-grato-recuerdo-que-dejaron-en-calama-seis-seleccionados-que-jugaron-en-cobreloa.html |work=Emol |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, Sánchez was promoted to the senior first team by manager [[Nelson Acosta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nelson Acosta alaba el nivel de Alexis Sánchez |url=http://www.latercera.com/contenido/656_168489_9.shtml |publisher=La Tercera |date=13 August 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025224123/http://www.latercera.com/contenido/656_168489_9.shtml |archivedate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex técnicos de Alexis aconsejan al tocopillano: "Que se vaya de Barcelona" |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/deportes/2014/07/656-585692-9-ex-tecnicos-de-alexis-aconsejan-al-tocopillano-que-se-vaya-de-barcelona.shtml |publisher=La Tercera |date=8 July 2014 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sánchez's made his debut against [[Deportes Temuco]] in February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medio catalán homenajeó a Alexis Sánchez a nueve años de su debut |url=http://redgol.cl/2014/2/medio-catalan-homenajeo-a-alexis-sanchez-a/ |work=Redgol.cl |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 victory over [[Deportes Concepción]] on 18 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=¡Feliz cumpleaños Alexis Sánchez!

After an impressive season with Cobreloa, Sánchez caught the attention of [[Serie A]] club [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], which signed him for a [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million fee, on 21 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Udinese sería el nuevo equipo de Alexis Sánchez |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2006/04/21/216979/udinese-seria-el-nuevo-equipo-de-alexis-sanchez.html |accessdate=21 July 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udinese, however, began a maturation project with Sánchez and immediately loaned him to Chilean giants [[Colo-Colo]] in a season-long deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Borghi renovó contrato con Colo-Colo |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2006/07/10/224692/borghi-renovo-contrato-con-colo-colo.html |accessdate=21 July 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexis Sánchez.jpg|thumb|190px|Sánchez on loan at Colo-Colo against [[Audax Italiano La Florida|Audax Italiano]] in the [[2006 Torneo Clausura (Chile)|2006 Torneo Clausura]] final.]]
Sánchez debuted for Colo-Colo on 23 June 2006 in a 1–1 draw with [[Deportes Antofagasta|Antofagasta]]; he scored his first goal on 29 October during the [[Chilean football derby]] against [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] in a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colo Colo se dio un festín y se quedó con el Superclásico en el Monumental |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2006/10/29/234429/colo-colo-se-dio-un-festin-y-se-quedo-con-el-superclasico-en-el-monumental.html |work=Emol |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=21 July 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His good performances allowed him break into the starting lineup after successfully challenging veteran striker [[Mario Cáceres]], so that began partnering [[Humberto Suazo]] in the forward position.

The next season, on 23 March 2007, he scored his first [[2007 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] goals against [[Caracas FC|Caracas]] at [[Cúcuta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prensa venezolana dice que Caracas fue 'un desastre' ante Colo Colo |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2007/03/21/249922/prensa-venezolana-dice-que-caracas-fue-un-desastre-ante-colo-colo.html |work=Emol |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he netted a [[hat-trick]] to a 4–0 away win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colo Colo golea 4–0 a Caracas FC y sigue vivo en la Copa Libertadores |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2007/03/20/249824/colo-colo-golea-4-0-a-caracas-fc-y-sigue-vivo-en-la-copa-libertadores.html |work=Emol |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May, Sánchez scored his first and only one [[2007 Torneo Apertura (Chile)|league goal]] during a 3–1 home win over [[Santiago Wanderers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colo Colo olvidó la Libertadores ganando a Wanderers |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2007/05/12/255681/colo-colo-olvido-la-libertadores-ganando-a-wanderers.html |work=Emol |date=12 May 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; key in the race for title with [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]] which Colo-Colo finally reached after beat [[CD Palestino|Palestino]] 1–0 at Monumental the last matchday.

After Sánchez's impressive [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA U-20 World Cup]] (where [[Chile national under-20 football team|Chile]] achieved the third place with [[José Sulantay]] as coach), his loan with Colo-Colo expired and on 15 August 2007, he joined Argentina's [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] on loan from Udinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexis Sánchez a River |url=http://www.diario26.com/alexis-sanchez-a-river-47118.html |publisher=diario26.com |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Udinese===
After a successful season in Argentina, Sánchez left South America in July 2008 to join Udinese, where he would meet up with Chilean compatriot [[Mauricio Isla]]. Sánchez made his non-competitive debut in a 3–0 win over [[Bassano Virtus 55 S.T.|Bassano]] and was named the man of match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adnmundo.com/contenidos/deportes/gran_debut_chileno_alexis_sanchez_udinese_futbol_italia_27_07_08_deportes.html |title=Gran debut de Alexis Sánchez en Udinese |work=adn mundo.cl |accessdate=27 July 2008 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729043853/http://www.adnmundo.com/contenidos/deportes/gran_debut_chileno_alexis_sanchez_udinese_futbol_italia_27_07_08_deportes.html |archivedate=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September, he played his first Serie A match in a 1–0 loss with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and four days later, he made his European debut against [[Borussia Dortmund]]. On 19 October 2008, Sánchez scored his first league goal against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]]. After this first goal, Sánchez got into a minor slump, in which he took much criticism. The criticism ended after scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] in a 1–0 win, being named the man of match.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Udinese2008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Sánchez (right) and fellow Chilean [[Mauricio Isla]] in a [[2008–09 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] match against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], on 6 November 2008.]]

The next season, Sánchez played an important role for Udinese in the [[2009–10 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], being a key player in the team that eliminated [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], assisting [[Gökhan Inler]] for the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1036/coppa-italia/2010/01/27/1764330/milan-0-1-udinese-gokhan-inler-sends-milan-packing-from |title=Gokhan Inler Sends The Rossoneri Packing From Coppa Italia |publisher=goal.com |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-final second leg, Sánchez was the man of match after playing a successful game against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], including scoring his first [[Coppa Italia]] goal in the 81st minute. It was not enough, however, as the aggregate score finished 2–1 in favour of Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triunfo.cl/prontus_triunfo/site/artic/20100421/pags/20100421143829.html |title=Alexis Sánchez anotó en eliminación de Udinese ante la Roma |publisher=triunfo.cl |accessdate=22 April 2009 |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424061629/http://www.triunfo.cl/prontus_triunfo/site/artic/20100421/pags/20100421143829.html |archivedate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of this year, Sánchez scored a total of 5 goals (4 at the end of tournament) in 32 appearances.

On 27 February 2011, Sánchez scored four of his team's seven goals as Udinese comfortably defeated [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]] 7–0, playing only the first 52 minutes of the game. This event meant he broke the record of goals scored by a Chilean player (in a single match) in Serie A,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serieaticketsonline.com/alexis-sanchezs-quart-trick-demolished-palermo/ |title=Alexis Sanchez's Quart-Trick Demolished Palermo |publisher=serieaticketsonline.com |accessdate=27 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111206/http://www.serieaticketsonline.com/alexis-sanchezs-quart-trick-demolished-palermo/|archive-date=26 March 2012|dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; beating the records set by countrymen [[Marcelo Salas]] and [[Iván Zamorano]].

During his successful season at Udinese, Sánchez and Italian striker [[Antonio Di Natale]] became one of the best scoring duos in Serie A; they tallied 39 goals between them, two goals short of the [[Alessandro Del Piero]]–[[David Trezeguet]] duo that completed 41 goals in the [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08 season]]. In recognition of his achievements, Sánchez was named the world's most promising youngster of the 2011 season by the users of [[FIFA]].com, where users had to choose between Sánchez, [[Gareth Bale]], [[Javier Pastore]], [[Paulo Henrique Ganso|Ganso]] and [[Neymar]] in a poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1699/chile/2011/06/17/2536401/udineses-alexis-sanchez-voted-the-worlds-most-promising |title=Udinese's Alexis Sanchez voted the world's most promising youngster in Fifa poll |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sánchez ranked 56th in the May 2011 edition of [[Castrol Performance Index]] and 24th among the forwards.

Sánchez's debut season for Barcelona was mired with short-term injuries. He made his debut on 14 August 2011 against archrivals [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[2011 Supercopa de España]] first leg away match, suffering a thigh injury after a challenge by [[Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)|Marcelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barcaloco.com/2011/08/alexis-sanchez-sidelined-one-week-with-injury/ |title=Bingo Rooms &amp; Promotions |date=9 March 2017 |website=Barcaloco.com |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona won the tie 5–4 on aggregate.

[[File:Alexis Sanchez Arsenal Vs Burnley (24736448805) (cropped).jpg|thumb|180px|Sánchez playing for Arsenal in 2016]]
Sánchez made his first appearance of the [[2015–16 Arsenal F.C. season|2015–16 season]] as a substitute in Arsenal's 2–0 loss to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the opening day of the [[2015–16 Premier League]]. The following week, on his first start of the season, Sánchez had a header deflected into the Crystal Palace net by [[Damien Delaney]] to give Arsenal a 2–1 win at [[Selhurst Park]]. The goal, however, was later credited as an own goal by the Palace defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33839766 |title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Arsenal |date=16 August 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2015, Sánchez ended a run of ten Premier League matches without a goal by scoring his first hat-trick for Arsenal in a 5–2 win at Leicester. This made him the first player to score hat-tricks in each of the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34299596 |title=Leicester 2–5 Arsenal |date=26 September 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sánchez then scored his first [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] goal of the season a few days later, in a 3–2 loss to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], latching onto a Theo Walcott cross to head beyond Olympiacos goalkeeper [[Roberto Jiménez Gago|Roberto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-live-blogs/11899111/Arsenal-vs-Olympiakos-Champions-League-live.html |title=Arsenal vs Olympiacos Champions League |website=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following league match, the last match before the international break, Sánchez scored for the third match in a row, scoring a brace in the first 20 minutes as Arsenal defeated [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3–0 at the Emirates Stadium and moved up to second place in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34372498 |title=Arsenal 3–0 Man Utd |publisher=BBC |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the international break, Sánchez carried on his fine goalscoring form by netting against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Vicarage Road]], through a [[Mesut Özil]] assist, in a 3–0 Arsenal win, keeping Arsenal in second-place and grabbing his sixth goal in three Premier League matches for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3277314/Watford-0-3-Arsenal-Alexis-Sanchez-continues-scoring-streak-Gunners-pace-leaders.html |title=Watford 0 – Arsenal 3 |newspaper=Daily Mail}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34493696 |title=Watford 0–3 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sánchez returned from the [[2017 Confederations Cup]] with an injury, and therefore had to miss the team's victory over Chelsea in the [[2017 FA Community Shield]] and the team's opening 4–3 win over Leicester City.

On 13 June 2014, Sánchez scored Chile's opening goal of the 2014 World Cup, and provided an assist, in a 3–1 defeat of [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in [[Cuiabá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285050 |title=Chile 3–1 Australia |accessdate=14 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 FIFA World Cup round of 16|round of 16]], Sánchez scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw against the hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

===2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification===
In Chile's first match of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2018 World Cup qualification]] on 9 October 2015, Sánchez scored in a 2–0 win over Brazil, Chile's first victory against the opponents since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chile 2–0 Brazil: Vargas &amp; Alexis consign Selecao to defeat |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/chile-vs-brazil/2116062/report |accessdate=14 October 2015 |publisher=Goal.com |date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he scored twice in a 4–3 win at [[Chile–Peru football rivalry|rivals]] Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kalinic |first1=Dejan |title=Peru 3–4 Chile: Sanchez stars in solid win |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/peru-vs-chile/2116069/report |accessdate=14 October 2015 |date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copa América Centenario===
In June 2016, Sánchez was part of the Chile squad that defended their Copa América title at the [[Copa América Centenario]] in the United States. On 14 June, needing a draw to progress to the knockout rounds, Chile fell 1–0 behind to [[Panama national football team|Panama]] before both Sánchez and Eduardo Vargas scored twice in a 4–2 win in [[Philadelphia]] to qualify for the tournament quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sharma |first1=Rik |title=Chile 4–2 Panama: Alexis Sanchez shines as Chilean strikeforce finally fires to deliver Copa America Centenario last eight place |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3642295/Chile-4-2-Panama-Alexis-Sanchez-shines-Chilean-strikeforce-finally-fires-deliver-Copa-America-Centenario-eight-place.html |accessdate=28 June 2016 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=15 June 2016}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days later, he scored one goal and registered two assists at [[Levi's Stadium]] in a 7–0 rout of [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], who were previously on a 22-game unbeaten streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tucker |first1=Duncan |title=Chile humiliate Mexico in 7–0 thrashing to advance to Copa América semi-final |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/19/chile-humiliate-mexico-7-0-quarter-final |accessdate=28 June 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chile's 2–0 semi-final victory over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], he became only the second Chilean – after [[Claudio Bravo]] – to reach [[100 caps]]. Sánchez was involved in Chile's second goal when his shot rebounded off the inside of the post and across the goal, presenting a tap-in for [[José Pedro Fuenzalida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Edwards |first1=Daniel |title=Alexis Sanchez reaches 100 caps for Chile |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/586/copa-america/2016/06/23/24947822/alexis-sanchez-reaches-100-caps-for-chile |accessdate=28 June 2016 |publisher=Goal.com |date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a repeat of the previous Copa América final, [[Copa América Centenario Final|Chile faced Argentina]]. Both teams had a player sent-off before half-time, and after a 0–0 draw, Chile were victorious via penalty kicks (4–2) to retain their title. Sánchez was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dutton |first1=Tom |title=Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez named Copa America player of the tournament as Chile defend title |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenals-alexis-sanchez-named-copa-america-player-of-the-tournament-as-chile-defend-title-a3281301.html |accessdate=28 June 2016 |work=London Evening Standard |date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 FIFA Confederations Cup===
In Chile's opening match of the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] on 18 June, Sánchez, who had been recovering from an ankle injury, came off the bench to set up Arturo Vidal's opening goal in an eventual 2–0 win over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/fifa-confederations-cup/2017/arturo-vidal-and-eduardo-vargas-score-as-chile-overcome-cameroon-despite-video-referee-mayhem_sto6222741/story.shtml |title=Arturo Vidal and Eduardo Vargas score as Chile overcome Cameroon despite video referee mayhem |publisher=Eurosport |author1=Badshah, Nadeem |date=18 June 2017 |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2017, Sánchez became Chile's out-right all-time goalscorer when he scored the opening goal in an eventual 1–1 draw against reigning World Cup champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in his team's second group match of the tournament, overtaking Marcelo Salas with his 38th international goal in 112 appearances, and also equalling Claudio Bravo as his nation's joint top appearance holder in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/chile/story/3147182/alexis-sanchez-becomes-chiles-all-time-top-scorer-with-38th-goal |title=Alexis Sanchez becomes Chile's all-time top scorer with 38th goal |publisher=ESPN FC |date=22 June 2017 |accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-match/60/post/3144632/germany-second-string-earn-draw-against-chile-that-bodes-well-for-world-cup-defence-in-2018 |title=Germany's second string earn draw vs. Chile that bodes well for World Cup |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Ogden, Mark |date=22 June 2017 |accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile defeated [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on penalties in the semi-final, before losing 0–1 in the final against [[Germany national football team|Germany]], with Sánchez coming close to an equaliser with his injury time free kick saved by German goalkeeper [[Marc-André ter Stegen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jul/02/chile-v-germany-confederations-cup-final-live |title=Chile 0–1 Germany: Confederations Cup final – as it happened |last=Harris |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-02 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-09-29 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Manuel Mata García''' ({{IPA-es|xwam ˈmata}}; born 28 April 1988) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]]. He mostly plays as a central attacking midfielder, but he can also play on the [[Midfielder#Winger|wing]].

A graduate of [[La Fábrica|Real Madrid's youth academy]], Mata played for [[Real Madrid Castilla]] in 2006–07, before joining [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the summer of 2007. He became an integral part of the club's midfield, making 174 appearances over the course of four seasons.&lt;ref name="guillembalague1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guillembalague.com/rumores_desp.php?id=293&amp;titulo=Liverpool,%20City%20and%20Manchester%20United%20show%20interest%20in%20Mata |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081306/http://www.guillembalague.com/rumores_desp.php?id=293&amp;titulo=Liverpool%2C%20City%20and%20Manchester%20United%20show%20interest%20in%20Mata |archivedate=26 April 2012 |title=Liverpool, City and Manchester United show interest in Mata |publisher=Guillem Balague's website |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Mata signed for English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] of the Premier League for a fee believed to be in the region of €28&amp;nbsp;million, and in his debut season was part of the team that won the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] and the [[2011–12 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. The following year, Chelsea won the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], making Mata and teammate [[Fernando Torres]] the first players to hold the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]] simultaneously. After falling out of favour at Chelsea under [[José Mourinho]], Mata was sold to Manchester United in January 2014, for a fee of £37.1&amp;nbsp;million.

Mata is a Spanish international, having represented Spain at [[Spain national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[Spain national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Spain national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[Spain national under-20 football team|under-20]], [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21]], [[Spain national under-23 football team|Olympic]] and senior levels. He played for the under-20 side in the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. In June 2009, Mata played at the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]], his first senior tournament. On 9 September 2009, Mata scored his first goal for the senior team, against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], securing the nation a place at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa, and was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad. In 2011, he went back to playing in the under-21 side, helping Spain win the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] in Denmark. He won the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Under-21 Golden Player|Golden Player]] award and was part of the Team of the Tournament. Mata returned to the senior squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and, after coming on as a substitute, scored Spain's fourth goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 final|final]] as Spain defeated [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4–0 to retain their title as champions of Europe.

==Early life==
Mata was born in the town of [[Burgos]], [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfef.es/index.jsp?nodo=39&amp;ID=3995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209231402/http://www.rfef.es/index.jsp?nodo=39&amp;ID=3995|archivedate=9 December 2013|title=La culminación del sueño de seis Campeones de Europa|trans-title=The culmination of a dream for six champions of Europe|publisher=rfef.es|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited his name from his father, Juan Manuel Mata Rodríguez, who was also a footballer, playing as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for nearby [[Burgos CF (I)|Burgos CF]] in the 1980s and early 1990s. Mata was raised in his father's home town of [[Oviedo]], [[Asturias]]. His father later acted as Mata's agent, becoming [[FIFA]]-registered in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2009/08/05/1423346/mata-could-buy-out-valencia-contract-to-complete-barcelona Mata could buy out Valencia contract to complete Barcelona move]. goal.com (5 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2009/07/03/1361140/barcelona-to-move-for-valencias-juan-mata-report|title=Barcelona To Move For Valencia's Juan Mata – Report|first=Lucas|last=Brown|publisher=goal.com|date=3 July 2009|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time, Mata enjoys [[table-tennis]], a sport he played as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juanmanuelmata.com/matabio.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301052037/http://juanmanuelmata.com/matabio.htm|archivedate=1 March 2009|title=Juan Manuel Mata's biography|publisher=Juan Mata|language=Spanish|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his move to Chelsea, he said he also enjoys sightseeing around [[London]]. He gained a nickname at Chelsea – "Johnny Kills" – the literal translation of his name from Spanish into English.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Simon. (6 December 2011) [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mr-valencia-sad-its-him-or-his-old-mate-mata-going-out-6272746.html Mr Valencia said it's him or his old mate Mata going out – European – Football]. The Independent.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
Mata started his football career at [[Real Oviedo]], where his father spent most of his career. He stayed there for three years before joining Real Madrid's youth academy, [[La Fábrica]], at age 15. After appearing for their ''Cadete A'' team, he swiftly progressed through the junior teams, ''Juvenil C'' and finally [[Real Madrid C.F. (youth)|''Juvenil A'']]. In his last campaign (2005–06), he scored two goals in the league and three more in the ''[[2005–06 División de Honor Juvenil de Fútbol#Final|Copa de Campeones]]'', including the winner in the final against [[Real Valladolid]], adding another three in the Spanish [[2006 Copa del Rey Juvenil|''Juvenil'' Cup]].

Switching to [[Real Madrid Castilla]] in [[2006–07 Segunda División|2006–07]], Mata was given the number 34 shirt in the first team, while wearing number 28 in Castilla. In spite of Castilla's final [[Segunda División]] relegation, he finished the season as the side's second best scorer at ten, behind [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Álvaro Negredo]], who registered 18.

===Valencia===
[[File:Juan Manuel Mata García.jpg|thumb|left|Mata at [[Ciudad Deportiva de Paterna|Paterna]] in 2009]]
Mata had a release clause at Real Madrid during his last season at the club, and eventually agreed to sign for fellow [[La Liga]] side [[Valencia CF]] in March 2007, with the contract starting on 30 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/valencia/es/desarrollo/750885.html|title=El Valencia le quita al Real Madrid al prometedor y cotizado Mata|trans-title=Valencia ''steals'' promising, highly rated Mata from Real Madrid|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=17 March 2007|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefitting from constant injuries to [[Vicente Rodríguez|Vicente]] and the ostracism to which then-manager [[Ronald Koeman]] condemned [[Miguel Ángel Angulo]], Mata gradually carved a niche in Valencia's first eleven. On 20 March 2008, he scored twice in the [[Copa del Rey]] [[2007–08 Copa del Rey|semi-final match]] against [[FC Barcelona]] to help Valencia reach [[2008 Copa del Rey Final|the final]] against [[Getafe CF]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=674619.html Mata seizes final chance for Valencia]; UEFA, 20 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where, on 16 April, he netted the opener in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=685087.html Morientes glad as Valencia get relief]; UEFA, 16 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During that first season, he was voted the team's ''Best Young Player'' by fans and players alike.

In the [[2008 Supercopa de España|2008]] [[Supercopa de España|Spanish SuperCup]], Mata scored against his former club Real Madrid in a 3–2 first leg win, but Valencia lost 5–6 on aggregate after a 2–4 away loss in the second game. He started [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09]] well, scoring in the opener against [[RCD Mallorca]] in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/253096/gamecast.html|title=Valencia 3–0 Mallorca|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=30 August 2008|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also netted the only goal of the game against [[CA Osasuna]], latching on to a long ball from [[David Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/252834/gamecast.html|title=Valencia 1–0 Osasuna|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2008, Mata proved to be growing in efficiency, as he set up two of his teammate's goals in a 2–0 away win over [[Málaga CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/252768/gamecast.html|title=Málaga 0–2 Valencia|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he put in a superb performance against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], scoring one and creating the other three, in a 4–2 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=754244.html Villa goals ensure Valencia victory]; UEFA, 28 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the campaign, Mata managed to score two very important late goals for Valencia: the first, the 3–2 winner at [[Sporting de Gijón]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/252826/gamecast.html|title=Sporting Gijon 4–3 Valencia|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=12 April 2009|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] against [[Sevilla FC]] at home, to put Valencia 2–1 up (specialist Villa had already been replaced due to injury) in an eventual 3–1 success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/253093/gamecast.html|title=Valencia 3–1 Sevilla FC|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=19 April 2009|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved impressive stats during the season, finishing with 11 successful strikes and 13 [[Assist (football)|assists]], behind just Barcelona's [[Xavi]] as the league's best.

In the following two seasons, Mata was an everpresent offensive figure for Valencia, scoring 17 goals in 68 games combined, with the club achieving back-to-back third-league places. On 10 April 2011, he netted two in a 5–0 home win against [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] neighbours [[Villarreal CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&amp;20110411&amp;56&amp;747493|title=Valencia put five past Villarreal|publisher=RTHK|date=10 April 2011|accessdate=2 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161043/http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&amp;20110411&amp;56&amp;747493|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/302117/gamecast.html|title=Valencia 5–0 Villarreal|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=10 April 2011|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, England-based Spanish journalist [[Guillem Balagué]] reported interest from several [[Premier League]] clubs.&lt;ref name="guillembalague1"/&gt;

On 26 August 2011, [[Yossi Benayoun]] offered Mata his number 10 shirt. The [[Israel national football team|Israeli]] captain said, "I decided to give Mata the number 10 – his favourite. For me, it's just a number, not my lucky 15." ([[Florent Malouda]] wore number 15 for Chelsea at the time.)

On 22 December 2012, Mata signed a contract extension with Chelsea which tied him up with the club until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stammers |first=Steve |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/juan-mata-new-contract-chelsea-1502569 |title=Juan Mata new contract: Chelsea tie down Spanish star to a new five-year deal – Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Boxing Day, Chelsea traveled to [[Carrow Road]] to face [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where both Manchester United and Arsenal had suffered defeats earlier in the season. Mata scored a brilliant goal in the 38th minute, taking a pass from [[Oscar (footballer born 1991)|Oscar]] into his stride and launching an unstoppable shot into the goal from 25 yards out. The goal turned out to be the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Owen |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20779143|title=Norwich 0–1 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2012|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 5 January, Mata provided assists for new acquisition [[Demba Ba]] and Branislav Ivanović to help Chelsea win 1–5 against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the 3rd round of the [[2012–13 FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20863303|title=Southampton 1–5 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 January 2013|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, he forced an own goal from [[Jonathan Walters]] by putting in a tight corner and earned a penalty which [[Frank Lampard]] converted. Chelsea went on to win the game 0–4, which was Stoke's first home defeat of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20919045|title=Stoke 0–4 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mata scored his eighth goal of the season in the Premier League against Arsenal in a 2–1 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21002559|title=Chelsea 2–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 January 2013|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2013, Mata made his 100th appearance in all competitions for Chelsea in a 1–0 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at Stamford Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.grada360.com/juanmata/en/2013/03/04/un-domingo-en-la-tierrina/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104154849/http://blogs.grada360.com/juanmata/2013/03/04/un-domingo-en-la-tierrina/ |archivedate=4 January 2014 |title=A family Sunday |publisher=Grada360 |date=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March, Mata scored an opening goal in Chelsea's [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] 3–1 (3–2) win against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase |first=Graham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21696158 |title=Chelsea 3–1 Steaua Buch't (agg 3–2) |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April, Mata was nominated for [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in recognition of his contribution to Chelsea's season in all competitions. The PFA's decision was based on his "ability to not only create goals but also score them himself" and saw him nominated alongside teammate [[Eden Hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ThePFA.com |url=http://www.thepfa.com/news/2013/4/19/pfa-nominees-poty-mata |title=PFA Nominees: Juan Mata – News – The PFA |publisher=Thepfa.com |date= |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also netted an 87th-minute winner against Manchester United, a crucial one for Chelsea's Champions League qualification hopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22328145|title=Manchester United 0–1 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/dubious-goals-decisions-2012-13.html |title=Dubious Goals Rulings for the 2012/13 season |publisher=Premierleague.com |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228081242/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/dubious-goals-decisions-2012-13.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May, Mata gave a fine performance in the [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final]] against Portugal's [[S.L.

He modestly gave the credit to the whole of the squad, saying that, "he felt proud to play for Chelsea," and thanked his teammates. He was also awarded Chelsea's Player of the Year for the second successive season. On winning his second award of the night, he said, "I feel so happy. It's my second season here and winning the trophy two years in a row is amazing for me.

====2013–14 season====
Under new Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], Mata spent a lot of time on the bench. Mourinho preferred [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] as a [[playmaker]], and suggested Mata needed to adapt to a wider position and to working harder defensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/20/chelsea-jose-mourinho-juan-mata |title=José Mourinho tells Juan Mata to adapt after blasting Chelsea's style |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 2013, Mata came on as a half-time substitute against [[Tottenham Hotspur]] to assist [[John Terry]] to score an equaliser in a 1–1 draw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/28/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league-live |title=Tottenham Hotspur 1–1 Chelsea – as it happened |first=Barry |last=Glendenning |website=The Guardian |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his appearances in the first team remained infrequent. On 29 October, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory at London rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/24619361|title=Arsenal 0–2 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mata struggled to secure a regular first-team place under Mourinho as he had started just 11 of Chelsea's 22 Premier League matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2014/01/22/4562449/mata-on-verge-of-49m-manchester-united-switch-as-he-misses |title=Mata on verge of €49m Manchester United switch as he misses Chelsea training |publisher=Goal.com |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mata scored 33 goals and provided 58 assists in 135 appearances over two-and-a-half seasons with Chelsea.

===Manchester United===
On 24 January 2014, Mourinho said Chelsea had accepted a transfer offer from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and he allowed Mata to travel to Manchester to undergo a medical, after the player said he was "really happy to go".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25882972|title=Juan Mata: Man United move delayed by Chelsea's Salah wait|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2014|first=David|last=Ornstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United confirmed later in the day that a transfer fee had been agreed, but that the deal was still contingent on Mata agreeing personal terms and passing a medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Communications Dept. |title=Reds agree deal for Mata |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jan/manchester-united-agree-deal-to-sign-juan-mata.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was completed the following day, with Manchester United paying Chelsea [[List of most expensive association football transfers|a then club record fee of £37.1&amp;nbsp;million]] (€46&amp;nbsp;million), with Mata signing a contract until the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/25882972|title=Juan Mata: Manchester United sign Chelsea midfielder for £37.1m|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
He made his debut against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 28 January and provided one assist in the 2–0 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/25822391|title=Manchester United 2–0 Cardiff|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mata scored his first goal for United in a 4–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 29 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United 4–1 Aston Villa |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/26694513|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also went on to score two goals against [[Newcastle United]] in a 4–0 away victory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newcastle United 0–4 Manchester United |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Apr/newcastle-united-v-manchester-united-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=5 April 2014 |first=Adam |last=Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; two more against [[Norwich City]] after coming off the bench in another 4–0 win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 4–0 Norwich City |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Apr/Manchester-United-v-Norwich-Premier-League-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=26 April 2014 |first=Tim |last=Oscroft}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only goal in a 1–1 draw against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the final match of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 4–0 Norwich City |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/May/Southampton-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=11 May 2014 |first=Gemma |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JuanMata DCTraining.jpg|thumb|right|Juan Mata during a training session in Washington D.C.]]
Mata ended the season having scored six goals for Manchester United, all in the Premier League, since he was cup tied and unable to play in the Champions League and other cup competitions due to his participation in the tournaments with Chelsea earlier in the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cup-tied Mata stays home |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2014/Feb/Juan-Mata-blog-24-February.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=24 February 2014 |first=Ben |last=Hibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Mata began the new season in fine form. He scored the only goal in [[Manchester United]]'s second game of the Premier League season, a 1–1 draw against [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Stadium of Light]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 1–1 Sunderland |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Aug/Sunderland-vs-Manchester-United-premier-league-2014-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=24 August 2014 |first=Ian |last=McLeish}}&lt;/ref&gt; following it up with a goal against [[Queens Park Rangers]] in a 4–0 thumping, which was also [[Louis van Gaal]]'s first competitive win in charge of United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 4–0 Queens Park Rangers |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Sep/Manchester-United-vs-qpr-premier-league-2014-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=14 September 2014 |first=Gemma |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later dropped to the bench for the following two matches, making cameo appearances against Leicester&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Confirmed Leicester City vs. Manchester United Lineups |url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/09/21/confirmed-leicester-city-vs-manchester-united-lineups-first-start-for-radamel-falcao-in-three-man-attack/ |work=caughtoffside.com |publisher=CaughtOffside.com |date=21 September 2014 |first=Mark |last=Brus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and West Ham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/09/27/confirmed-manchester-united-west-ham-united-line-ups/|title=Confirmed Manchester United vs. West Ham United Lineups|publisher=hereisthecity.com|first=Olly|last=Dawes|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with van Gaal preferring an attacking trinity of [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Robin van Persie]] and new signing [[Radamel Falcao]] in both games.

Following Rooney's sending off and suspension due to a foul on [[Stewart Downing]] in the match against West Ham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29289922|title=Manchester United 2–1 West Ham United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mata was reinstated to the starting lineup, and he started the next match against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], a 2–1 win at Old Trafford in which he provided the assist for [[Ángel Di María]]'s goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 2–1 Everton |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Oct/Manchester-United-vs-everton-premier-league-2014-match-report.aspx |work=manutd.com |publisher=Manchester United FC Official Website |date=5 October 2014 |first=Adam |last=Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mata later scored winning goals in home games against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29860235|title=Manchester United 1–0 Crystal Palace|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], the former after coming on as a second-half substitute.

Mata was made [[captain (association football)|captain]] for the home game against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 2 March and scored a free kick, which was also the match-winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35647650|title=Manchester United 1–0 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 March 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March, in a 1–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], Mata received his first career [[Ejection (sports)#Association football|red card]] after obtaining two yellow cards in the space of three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35681004|title=West Bromwich Albion 1–0 Manchester United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mata assisted an [[Anthony Martial]] goal against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] in the final game at the [[Boleyn Ground]]; however, United lost 3–2, ending their chances of beating [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for fourth-place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36189168|title=West Ham United 3–2 Manchester United|website=BBC Sport|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 2018, Mata scored the equaliser from a free kick in a late comeback 2–1 win over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in a [[2018-19 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46087302|title=Manchester United stun Juventus|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Torres, Mata and Ramos Euro 2012 trophy 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fernando Torres]], Mata and [[Sergio Ramos]] celebrating after winning [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]

Mata helped [[Spain national under-19 football team|Spain]] win the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]], where he was a key player. He finished the championship second to his teammate [[Alberto Bueno]] (five goals) as top goal scorer of the competition, with four in five matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/under19/news/newsid=439617.html Spain sweep into U19 final] UEFA, 26 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2007, [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21]] coach [[Iñaki Sáez]] included him on his squad for the friendly against [[England national under-21 football team|England]], alongside [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] teammates [[Roberto Soldado]], [[José Manuel Jurado]], [[Sergio Sánchez Ortega|Sergio Sánchez]], [[Miguel Torres Gómez|Miguel Torres]], [[Esteban Granero]], and [[Antonio Adán]], at just 18 years and 10 months.

On 14 November 2008, [[Vicente del Bosque]] called up Mata for the [[Spain national football team|senior team]] to play in a friendly against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. He did not leave the bench in a 3–0 home win. On 28 March 2009, he finally made his debut, playing in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]] against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], a 1–0 win in [[Madrid]]. He came on as a substitute for teammate [[David Villa]] in the 63rd minute.

In June 2009, Del Bosque included Mata for the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]], the youngster's first senior tournament. He started in the second group match against [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] and came on as a substitute for [[Albert Riera]] in the semi-final loss to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].

[[File:Juan Manuel Mata, Adrián López, and Alberto Botía, U21 in 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Mata, [[Adrián López]], and [[Alberto Botía]] lining up for [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain U21]] in 2011]]
On 9 September 2009, Mata scored his first goal for the senior team, as the 3–0 win against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] secured a place in the World Cup in South Africa. He followed this up with the winner against [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] on 10 October, scoring a penalty to steal a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/southafrica2010/news/newsid=1116149/index.html Mata keeps Spain perfect]; FIFA, 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Picked for the final stages, he appeared once for the eventual champions, replacing [[Fernando Torres]] for the final 20 minutes of the 2–0 group stage win against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].

In 2011, the following summer, he went back to the under-21 side, playing the role of senior squad member and helped Spain win the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] in Denmark. Mata himself was included in [[UEFA]]'s Team of the Tournament and named as the tournament's [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship#Under-21 Golden Player|Golden Player]].

Mata returned to the senior squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and, after coming on as a substitute, scored Spain's fourth goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 final|final]] as Spain defeated [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4–0 to retain their title as champions of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/spain/9365288/Spain-4-Italy-0-match-report.html Spain 4 Italy 0: match report]. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mata was included in [[Spain national under-23 football team|Spain]]'s squad for the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympic football tournament]] as one of their three designated overage players. Spain, however, failed to score in any of their opening three matches and were eliminated at the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/4433/2012-olympics/2012/07/30/3276603/juan-manuel-mata-takes-to-twitter-to-apologise-for-spain-olympic-?source=breakingnews Mata: Spain deserved more at Olympics]; Goal.com, 31 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A left footed [[attacking midfielder]] who can also be deployed on the [[right winger|right wing]], Mata makes up for a lack of pace with his control, technique, passing and vision, which allows him to register many [[Assist (football)|assists]] (he was the [[Premier League]]'s top assist provider in [[2012–13 Premier League|2012–13]]). At 5'7" he lacks great strength or aerial ability, but is agile and nimble. Mata is also a well-known free kick specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/kickingandscreaming/id/467?cc=5901|title=The 2012–13 Prem Best XI|website=espnfc.com|last=Hirshey|first=David|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In November 2012, along with fellow Premier League players [[Santi Cazorla]] and [[Michu]], Mata bought shares in former club Real Oviedo, who were struggling to raise €2&amp;nbsp;million to stay afloat in the Spanish third division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Real Oviedo – the remarkable story of a club the world united to save |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/29/real-oviedo-spain-premier-league |website=theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2017, Mata announced in an article for [[The Players' Tribune]] that he was pledging one percent of his salary to a pledge-based charitable movement, named [[Common Goal (charity)|Common Goal]], and called for other football players to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/news/common-goal-juan-mata-football-charity/9ebv9emew831k5zs19deolqe|title=WHAT IS COMMON GOAL?

'''Romelu Menama Lukaku Bolingoli''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈroːmeːlu luˈkaːku}}; born 13 May 1993) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for English club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. 

Born in [[Antwerp]], Lukaku began his professional career at [[Belgian First Division A|Belgian Pro League]] club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in 2009, where he made his senior debut, at age 16. In his first season, he completed the campaign as the league's top goalscorer, and won the league championship. Following similar individual success in his second season, highlighted by his win of the [[Belgian Ebony Shoe]], Lukaku relocated to England to transfer to [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2011, for a fee of £10&amp;nbsp;million (€12&amp;nbsp;million).

Lukaku featured sparingly in his first campaign at Chelsea, and instead, he decided to depart on loan at fellow league club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 2012. Lukaku shone with the team, registering 17 league goals, and guided the club to an unlikely eighth-place finish. However, after no further reassurances over playing time, he again departed on loan, this time to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], in 2013. After finishing the season with 15 league goals and helping Everton reach a club-record points tally, he joined the team in a permanent deal worth a club-record fee of £28&amp;nbsp;million in 2014. 

After three successful individual campaigns on Merseyside, which included an appearance in the [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)#Premier League 8|2016–17]] [[PFA Team of the Year]], Lukaku signed for Manchester United in 2017, for an initial fee of £75&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romelu Lukaku completes Manchester United move in deal that could reach world record £90m |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/07/10/romelu-lukaku-completes-75m-manchester-united-move/ |work=The Telegraph |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer made him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive Belgian player of all time]].

A Belgian international, Lukaku has played 79 games for his country, and registered 45 goals, making him [[Belgium national football team records and statistics#General 2|Belgium's all-time top goalscorer]].{{Cref2|N1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.live.sporza.be/cm/lmc.mobile/m_mc_voetbal/oefeninterlands/1.3087128|title=Duivels winnen geen zieltjes met krappe oefenzege, Lukaku topschutter aller tijden|website=m.live.sporza.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lukaku made his senior international debut for Belgium in 2010, at age 17, and has since represented his country at three major tournaments, including two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and one [[UEFA Euro 2016|UEFA European Championship]]. At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], Lukaku led Belgium to a third place finish by finishing as the joint second-highest goalscorer, and won the Bronze Boot.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lukaku joined his local team [[K. Rupel Boom F.C.|Rupel Boom]] at age five. After four seasons at Rupel Boom, Lukaku was discovered by scouts of [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]], a [[Belgian First Division A|Belgian Pro League]] club with an established youth academy. He played for Lierse from 2004 until 2006, scoring 121 goals in 68 matches.&lt;ref name=LukakuYouth&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/01/17/2309143/romelu-lukaku-the-full-interview-teenage-sensation-reveals |title=The Full Interview: Teenage Sensation Reveals All About His Life, Loves And His Footballing 'Gift From God' |publisher=Goal.com |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lierse were relegated from the Belgian Pro League, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] purchased 13 youth players from Lierse in the 2006 mid-season, including Lukaku. He played three more years as a youth player with Anderlecht, scoring 131 goals in 93 matches.

===Anderlecht===
When Lukaku turned 16 on 13 May 2009, he signed a professional contract with Anderlecht lasting until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=43883 |title=Lukaku : " Je sais que je serai récompensé de mes efforts " |publisher=FootGoal.net |date=2 September 2009 |accessdate=17 November 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903180212/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=43883 |archivedate=3 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven days later, he made his Belgian First Division debut on 24 May 2009 in the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division#Championship playoff|championship play-off]] match against [[Standard Liège]] as a 69th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Defender (association football)|defender]] [[Víctor Bernárdez]].&lt;ref name=StandardBelgi&gt;{{cite news| title = Standard is opnieuw kampioen van België| url = http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/2.5503/MF_090524_STA_AND| publisher = Sporza| date = 24 May 2009| accessdate = 26 May 2009| language = Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderlecht lost the match 1–0. Lukaku became a regular member of Anderlecht's first team during the [[2009–10 R.S.C. Anderlecht season|2009–10 season]], scoring his first goal at senior level against [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] in the 89th minute after coming on as substitute for [[Rubenilson dos Santos da Rocha|Kanu]] on 28 August 2009. "After scoring I dived into a sea of happiness," he told Berend Scholten from UEFA.com. "You think you are flying and can take on the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1457433.html|title=Lukaku fast-tracked to the top|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=6 March 2010|work=Berend Scholten, UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season as the top goalscorer in the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League|Pro League]] with 15 goals as Anderlecht won its 30th [[List of Belgian football champions|Belgian title]].&lt;ref name=punches&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/01/romelu-lukaku-anderlecht|title=Anderlecht's Romelu Lukaku punches his weight and some – aged only 16|date=2 April 2010|accessdate=13 April 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored four goals during the club's run to the last 16 of the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref name=punches/&gt; During the [[2010–11 Belgian Pro League|2010–11 season]], Lukaku scored 20 goals in all competitions, but Anderlecht failed to retain their league title despite finishing top of the table during the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/08/28/2640475/chelsea-striker-romelu-lukaku-dreams-of-playing-alongside|title=Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku dreams of playing alongside his brother Jordan|date=28 August 2011|accessdate=13 April 2014|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:Romelu Lukaku Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.jpg|thumb|140px|upright|left|Lukaku warming up for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2013]]

In August 2011, Lukaku joined [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee reported to be around €12&amp;nbsp;million (£10&amp;nbsp;million), rising to €20&amp;nbsp;million (£17&amp;nbsp;million) in add-ons. Lukaku was given the number 18 shirt and signed a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/cnt/DC3DOMDV|title=Chelsea betaalt 12 miljoen voor Lukaku (maar het kan oplopen tot 20 miljoen)|publisher=Sportwereld|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his home debut in a 3–1 victory over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the 83rd minute, coming on as a substitute for [[Fernando Torres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14600575.stm |title=Chelsea 3–1 Norwich|publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2011 |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukaku made his first start for the club in the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. Chelsea went on to win the match on [[penalty shootout|penalties]]. He spent the majority of the season playing for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserves]] and started his first Premier League match on 13 May 2012, , against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and turned in a [[man of the match]] performance, providing an [[Assist (football)|assist]] for [[John Terry]]'s opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-cruise-against-blackburn-rovers-ahead-of-champions-league-final-in-munich-7743453.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Nick | last=Szczepanik | date=14 May 2012 | title=Chelsea cruise against Blackburn Rovers ahead of Champions League final in Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lukaku stressed he was disappointed with his involvement at the end of his debut season, revealing that, after his side's [[UEFA Champions League]] win in [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]] on 19 May, he refused to hold the trophy as he did not feel like a winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romelu Lukaku felt no joy at Chelsea's Champions League win|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18284627|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Lukaku is a left-footed player,&lt;ref&gt;Veysey, Wayne (6 August 2011).

Lukaku has also been known to use his physicality to get around defenders.&lt;ref name="top10list" /&gt;

===Influences===
In a 2016 interview with [[ESPN]], Lukaku named [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Nicolas Anelka]] as the two strikers who made him want to play for Chelsea, but it was the mention of a third striker during the interview, his ultimate idol [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], that he lit up with excitement, with Lukaku stating,

{{quote|"Ronaldo changed football. He was the one you would look at. You would see him doing step-overs and you were thinking: 'Who does this?' You would see defenders falling over and you were like: 'Wow.' The goals that he scored, and at crucial times. He scored goals where you were like: 'Oh man, this is not serious.'"|Lukaku speaking to ESPN on his idol, Ronaldo.&lt;ref name="idol"/&gt;}}

Crediting the former Brazilian striker as his major influence as a kid, Lukaku added, “He changed the dimension of a striker. He was fast, he can dribble like a winger, run like a sprinter, he was as strong as an ox.”&lt;ref name="idol"/&gt; His devotion to Ronaldo is such that he finds the time to search YouTube for videos of him. When mentioned that he shares certain characteristics with the Brazilian, Lukaku responded, "Be like Ronaldo? There is only one Ronaldo.”&lt;ref name="idol"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Rory |title=Ronaldo deserves more credit as one of the game's greatest players |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/brazil/205/blog/post/2840087/ronaldo-deserves-more-credit-as-one-of-the-games-best |agency=ESPN|accessdate=25 August 2018 |date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up, his idol was Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] – the first game he saw was Ronaldo scoring a [[hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] in 2003, a game when Ronaldo was given a standing ovation by both sets of fans when he left the field.&lt;ref name="Idol"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Law |title=Marcus Rashford: Ronaldo is my hero, as a kid I saw him destroy Manchester United |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/11/12/marcus-rashford-reveals-tried-emulate-brazil-legend-ronaldo/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 November 2017 |accessdate=10 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronaldo ends Man Utd dream |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/2965089.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 April 2003 |accessdate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashford states, "I've grown up watching so much of him and his games. He always played free. No matter where he was playing, he played free and went out there and expressed himself. When you do that, that's when you play your best football."&lt;ref name="Idol"/&gt;

He was the recipient of the 2015 [[Golden Boy Award]] for the best under-21 player in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Dec/Manchester-United-striker-Anthony-Martial-wins-Golden-Boy-award-for-best-young-player-in-Europe.aspx |title=Anthony Martial wins Golden Boy award – Official Manchester United Website |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing youth football for [[CO Les Ulis|Les Ulis]], he began his professional career at [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], then transferred to [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in 2013 for a fee of €6&amp;nbsp;million. He was a member of Monaco's squad for two seasons, and signed for Manchester United in 2015 for an initial fee of £36&amp;nbsp;million which could potentially rise to £57.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthony Martial could cost Man United £57.6&amp;nbsp;million – Monaco vice-president |url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/2594161/anthony-martial-could-cost-man-united-57-6-million-monaco |website=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest fee paid for a teenager in football history even before the potential increase. He scored in his first match for United, and was named the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] in his first month in English football.

A youth international for France from [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] to [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level, Martial made his senior debut in 2015. He was named in their squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Early career and Lyon===
Born in [[Massy, Essonne]], Martial spent his youth years with [[Paris]]-based [[CO Les Ulis]] from 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/equipes-de-france/tous-les-joueurs/fiche-joueur/2318054571-anthony-martial |title=Joueur – Anthony MARTIAL |publisher=French Football Federation |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same team who produced French internationals [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Patrice Evra]].&lt;ref name=ulis/&gt; Evra closely monitored the progress of Martial, and allowed him to play in one of his pairs of football boots at the age of 12.&lt;ref name=ulis/&gt; At the same age, Martial trialled at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref name=ulis/&gt;

At just 14 years old in 2009 he was spotted by scouts from the [[Olympique Lyonnais]] academy and joined it the same year. During his second season in the Under-17 team he distinguished himself by scoring 32 goals in 21 games, which resulted in a call-up to the [[France national under-17 football team]] for the [[2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]] in Slovenia.

He made his professional debut for Lyon on 6 December 2012, in a [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage|group stage]] match against [[Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona F.C.|Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona]], replacing goalscorer [[Yassine Benzia]] for the final 10 minutes of a 2–0 victory at the [[Stade de Gerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Imperious Lyon cruise past Kiryat Shmona |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000356/match=2010027/index.html |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=UEFA |date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first [[Ligue 1]] game was on 3 February 2013 against [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]], when he came on as a substitute in the 79th minute for [[Rachid Ghezzal]] in a 3–1 away loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lyon boit la tasse à Ajaccio|trans-title=Lyon frink from the cup at Ajaccio |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/sports/football/article/lyon-boit-la-tasse-ajaccio-225365 |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=France Info |date=3 February 2013 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made two further appearances from the bench that season.

In his second season at Monaco, Martial scored nine goals in 36 Ligue 1 games, starting on 5 October 2014 when as a substitute for [[Lucas Ocampos]], he gained a 1–1 draw at reigning champions [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] with a last-minute strike from close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Ames |title=Monaco's Anthony Martial thwarts PSG in battle of Ligue 1 big spenders |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/05/psg-monaco-ligue-1-match-report |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 October 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice against a 10-man [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] on 13 March 2015 in a 3–0 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monaco 3–0 Bastia |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31826994 |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June, he further extended his link with the team until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Martial-prolonge/435754 |newspaper=L'Équipe |location=Paris |title=Martial extends |date=27 June 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transfer====
On 1 September 2015, Martial completed a move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for £36&amp;nbsp;million, potentially rising to £58&amp;nbsp;million, on a four-year contract with the option of another year.&lt;ref name=GuardianMartial&gt;{{cite news |title=Anthony Martial signs for Manchester United for £36m from Monaco |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/01/manchester-united-sign-monaco-forward-anthony-martial |accessdate=1 September 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |last=Jackson |first=Jamie |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMailMartial&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United complete £36m Anthony Martial transfer on four-year deal |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3218622/Manchester-United-complete-36m-Anthony-Martial-transfer-four-year-deal.html |last1=Upal |first1=Sunni |last2=Barlow |first2=Matt |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2015 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest transfer fee paid for a teenager, breaking the previous record of £27&amp;nbsp;million United paid for [[Luke Shaw]] a year earlier, and that Paris Saint-Germain had paid for [[Marquinhos]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title=Anthony Martial: Man Utd sign Monaco forward for £36m |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34107092 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; United paid £36&amp;nbsp;million up front for Martial, but his contract contains three bonus clauses worth £7.2&amp;nbsp;million each, taking the potential fee to £57.6&amp;nbsp;million. The clauses each relate to certain accomplishments being achieved in the next four years, including if Martial scores 25 goals during that span, racks up 25 caps for [[France national football team|France]] or wins the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]] before June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Report: Martial Contract Clauses Emerge |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2561102-manchester-united-transfer-news-anthony-martial-clauses-reported-fresh-rumours |accessdate=5 October 2015 |first=Tom |last=Sunderland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Louis van Gaal]] called Martial an acquisition for United's future rather than for immediate use, and called the transfer fee "ridiculous", alleging that Manchester United regularly had to pay £10&amp;nbsp;million more than other teams.&lt;ref name=DailyMailMartial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paying £58.8m for Anthony Martial 'ridiculous', admits Louis van Gaal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/10/fee-anthony-martial-ridiculous-louis-van-gaal |accessdate=12 September 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon signing, Martial said, "I'm so excited to join United, I have always wanted to play in the Premier League and to join the biggest club in the world is what every young footballer dreams of." Van Gaal stated, "Anthony is a naturally talented, young, multi-functional forward with great potential. I believe this is the club for him to continue his development." The fee was reportedly met with astonishment by the French public.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

On 21 October, in a Champions League [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] match away to [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], Martial gave away a penalty – which [[David de Gea]] saved from [[Roman Eremenko]] – and later equalised to confirm a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSKA 1–1 Man Utd |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34129032 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy]] as Europe's best under-21 player on 19 December.&lt;ref name=swales&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swales |first1=Andy |title=Manchester United's Anthony Martial is Europe's Golden Boy for 2015 |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10104305/manchester-uniteds-anthony-martial-is-europes-golden-boy-for-2015 |accessdate=19 December 2015 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful spell for Manchester United towards the end of last season, winning the League Cup and Europa League, Martial started the season as a substitute for most matches. Despite this Martial managed to score from the bench in United's first two leage matches against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], and again later against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]; with all three matches ending in a 4–0 win for United. Martial's first start of the season came on 20 September in a 4–1 win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton upon Trent]] in the League Cup in which he also scored. Martial repeated this a week later in the Champions League, scoring in a 4–1 win over [[CSKA Moscow]]. In October Martial scored United's only goal in their win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and again in November against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. In January, Martial scored again against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] away, scored against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and provide the winning goal against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

==International career==
===Youth===
[[File:Martial v England 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Martial playing for [[France national football team|France]] in 2015]]

Martial scored five goals as France topped their [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification|qualification group]] for the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship: two goals in a 5–0 win over the [[Faroe Islands national under-17 football team|Faroe Islands]], and a [[hat-trick]] against [[Northern Ireland national under-17 football team|Northern Ireland]] in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Babaev |first1=David |title=Last-gasp Luxembourg go forward with France |url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1708361.html |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=UEFA |date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added two more in [[2015 UEFA European Under-19 Championship elite round|elite round]] victories against [[Switzerland national under-17 football team|Switzerland]] and [[Sweden national under-17 football team|Sweden]] to confirm qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EDF/U17 = LA FRANCE EN PHASE FINALE !|trans-title=EDF/U17 = FRANCE IN THE FINALS! |url=http://www.lestitisdupsg.fr/edfu17-la-france-en-phase-finale/ |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=Les Titis du PSG |date=29 March 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He netted once in a group stage exit at the final tournament in Slovenia, a 2–2 opening game draw with [[Iceland national under-17 football team|Iceland]] at the [[Domžale Sports Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Dan |title=Iceland comeback checks France |url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1792810.html |accessdate=31 August 2015 |date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial played all five games for [[France national under-19 football team|France under-19]] at the [[2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2013 European Championship]] in Lithuania, finishing as runners-up to [[Serbia national under-19 football team|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haslam |first1=Andrew |title=Luković strike seals first Serbia triumph |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/news/newsid=1978071.html |accessdate=31 August 2015 |publisher=UEFA |date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of five Frenchmen selected in the Team of the Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical Report |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2013/technical-report/tr-under19-2013.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=11 April 2016 |pages=18–19 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
On 26 August 2015, Martial was called up to the senior France squad for the first time, for [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deschamps calls up Martial, leaves out Sakho |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/deschamps-calls-martial-leaves-out-sakho |accessdate=31 August 2015 |magazine=FourFourTwo |publisher=26 August 2015 |date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the former on 4 September at [[Lisbon]]'s [[Estádio José Alvalade]], replacing [[Karim Benzema]] for the final 16 minutes of a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portugal 0–1 France: Valbuena strikes late to sink Ronaldo &amp; Co |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/portugal-vs-france/1703405/report |accessdate=4 September 2015 |publisher=Goal.com |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October, Martial made his first start for ''Les Bleus'' in a 2–1 win against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] at [[Parken Stadium]], Copenhagen, and assisted the opening goal by [[Olivier Giroud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/finals/news/newsid=2292479.html |title=Giroud at the double as France see off Denmark |date=11 October 2015 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to Martial performances in the 2015–2016 season with Manchester United, he earned a spot on France's 23-man squad for [[Euro 2016]], in which France were the tournament runners up. On 17 May 2018, Martial was named on the standby list for the 23-man [[French national football team|French squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/12025/11376691/alexandre-lacazette-and-anthony-martial-on-standby-for-france-world-cup-squad-and-dimitri-payet-out |title=Alexandre Lacazette and Anthony Martial on standby for France World Cup squad and Dimitri Payet out – soccer News – Sky Sports |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=6 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not make the final squad for the tournament which saw France as champions for the second time.

==Style of play==
Aziz Benaaddane, one of Martial's coaches at Les Ulis, told the [[BBC Sport]] in 2015 that as a six-year-old, Martial was able to run in a straight line to the goal: "We've got 400 youngsters playing for us but a talent like that arrives only once every five or six years. We felt it, we saw the potential and we pushed him".&lt;ref name=ulis/&gt; Mahamadou Niakite, another coach, added that Martial was put in higher age groups, as at the age of six he had the ability of most eight-year-olds, and at around the age of 12–13 he was focused on becoming a professional.&lt;ref name=ulis/&gt;

According to journalist [[Philippe Auclair]], Martial plays in a style similar to former French international [[Thierry Henry]], with speed and technical ability both in wide positions and up front.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Henry himself praised Martial after his goalscoring debut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chick |first1=Alex |title=Thierry Henry praises Anthony Martial goal: 'I love the finish' |url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/premier-league-1/2015-2016/thierry-henry-praises-anthony-martial-goal-i-love-the-finish_sto4908970/story.shtml |date=12 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2015 |publisher=Eurosport}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Martial himself refuted the comparison, saying "I don't think we have the same type of game – he was very quick whereas I rely more on power and technique. But it's always good to be compared to great players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leras |first=Marc |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2235158.html |title=Martial seizing the day with Monaco |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=18 October 2015 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of France's 2–1 win over Denmark in October 2015, Fenerbahçe defender [[Simon Kjær]] was reportedly stunned after playing against him to learn that Martial was just 19. He told French newspaper  ''[[L'Équipe]]'', "He's really good for 19. I didn't know him when I was in France. He's very, very hard to mark because he knows how to do a lot of things. Not only is he quick, but he's also technically good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hover |first=Ashley |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/martial-very-hard-to-mark-says-denmark-defender-kjaer/489787 |title=Martial 'very hard' to mark, says Denmark defender Kjaer |date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=18 October 2015 |website=Squawka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial, for his part, has said that he prefers to play [[Forward (association football)|up front]], but that "if the coach puts me on [[Midfielder#Winger|the wing]] then that means it is better for the team and for me that is the most important thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://deadspin.com/a-reminder-that-anthony-martial-is-still-a-goddamn-chil-1767586063 |title=A Reminder That Anthony Martial Is Still A Goddamn Child |last=Haisley |first=Billy |date=28 March 2016 |website=Deadspin |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lee Grant''' (born '''Lyova Haskell Rosenthal'''; October 31, during the mid-1920s){{efn|name="birth year note"}} is an American actress and film director.

In her 1951 film debut, she played the role of a young shoplifter in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'', co-starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. It earned her an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], along with the Best Actress Award at the [[1952 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 1952, as she had refused to testify against her husband at the [[HUAC]] hearings, she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] from most acting jobs for the next ten years. She was then only able to find occasional work on the stage or as a teacher during that period. It also contributed to her divorce. After she was removed from the blacklist in 1962, she rebuilt her acting career in films, after which she starred in 71 TV episodes of ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1965–1966), followed by lead roles in films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1967), and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won her first Oscar. In 1964, she won the [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]] for her performance in ''[[The Maids]]''. During her career, she was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] seven times between 1966 and 1993, winning twice.

==Early life==
Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jerry.

''The Film Encyclopedia'', Harper Perennial (1998) p. 552; {{ISBN|0-06-273492-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Manhattan]], the only child of Witia ([[married and maiden names|née]] Haskell), an actress and teacher, and Abraham W. Rosenthal, a realtor and educator. Her father was born in New York City, to [[Polish-Jewish]] immigrants, and her mother was a [[Russian-Jewish]] immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/202192/lee-grant-said-yes-to-everything-except-mccarth Profile], forward.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The family resided at 706 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], in the [[Hamilton Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/38/Lee-Grant.html Lee Grant profile], FilmReference.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her date of birth is October 31, but the year is disputed, with all years ranging from 1925 to 1931 having been given as her year of birth at some point; however, census data, travel manifests, and testimony suggest that she was born in 1925 or 1926, while Grant's stated ages at the time of her professional debut and Oscar nomination indicate she was born in 1927.{{efn|name="birth year note"}}

She debuted in ''[[Franco Leoni|L'Oracolo]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Olin Downes.

''Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue'', Random House (2005) p. 154&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Art Students League of New York]], [[Juilliard School of Music]], [[The High School of Music &amp; Art]], and [[George Washington High School (New York City)|George Washington High School]], all in New York City. Grant graduated from high school, and won a scholarship to the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]], and studied under [[Sanford Meisner]]. Studied at [[HB Studio]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbstudio.org/about-hb-studio/alumni/ HB Studio Alumni]&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Uta Hagen]]. She subsequently enrolled in [[Actors Studio]] in New York.

==Career==
===1940s{{ndash}}1950s===
Grant had her first stage ballet performance in 1933 at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/75242%7C96586/Lee-Grant/milestones.html Turner Classic Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, in her early teens, she was made a member of the [[American Ballet]], under [[George Balanchine]].&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt; As an actress, Grant had her professional stage debut as understudy in ''Oklahoma'' in 1944. In 1948, she had her Broadway acting debut in ''Joy to the World''. Grant established herself as a dramatic [[method acting|method]] actress on and off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], earning praise for her role as a shoplifter in ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{IBDB name|42830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her film debut two years later in the film version (''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]''), starring [[Kirk Douglas]], receiving her first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination, and winning the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] Award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She said she enjoyed working under director [[William Wyler]], who helped guide her.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL3iv9gUAPA;t=1m43s Lee Grant, "Inside the Actors Studio" 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box||align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=But as quickly as that dream unfolded, her life soon turned into a nightmare... So right when her career should have been blooming, she was banned from working in Hollywood. And that ban lasted for twelve years, a lifetime for an actor.|source=[[Robert Osborne]], ''Turner Classic Movies'' interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/1033419/Conversation-With-Lee-Grant-A-TCM-Original-2014.html "Conversation With Lee Grant", 2014], tcm.com; accessed May 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1951, she gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for actor [[J. Edward Bromberg]], whose early death, she implied, was caused by the stress of being called before [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). After her eulogy was published, she was summoned by the same committee to testify against her husband, playwright [[Arnold Manoff]], but refused. As a result, for the next ten years, her "prime years", as she put it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lee-grant-on-life-beyond-the-hollywood-blacklist "Lee Grant on life beyond the Hollywood blacklist"], CBSnews.com, August 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] and her work in television and movies was limited.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLf3Ga4ZBM Turner Classic Movies "Evening With Lee Grant" (1of4), ''Detective Story''], interview with [[Robert Osborne]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirk Douglas]], who acted with her in ''Detective Story'', recalled that director [[Edward Dmytryk]], a blacklistee, had first named her husband at the HUAC:{{quote|Lee was only a kid, a beautiful young girl with extraordinary talent and a big future. You could see it. She was so good that she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her very first film role. But because Eddie Dmytryk named her husband, Lee Grant was blacklisted before her film career even had a chance to begin. Of course, she refused to testify about the man to whom she was married, and it took years before anyone would hire her for another picture.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Kirk. ''I Am Spartacus: Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist'', Open Road Media (2012) p. 26; {{ISBN|978-1453254806}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant appeared in a limited number of stage and television shows during these years. In 1953, she played Rose Peabody on the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. In the Broadway production of ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' in 1959, she succeeded [[Anne Bancroft]] in the lead female role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/lee-grant/11/ "Two for the Seesaw"], CBS News, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:Lee Grant - 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1961]]
By the time her name was finally removed from the blacklist in the early 1960s, she had since been divorced, remarried, and had a young daughter, [[Dinah Manoff|Dinah]]. She began re-establishing her television and movie career. In her autobiography, she writes:{{quote|Dinah was my grail, my constant; nothing and no one could get between us. Dinah and my need to support her financially, morally, viscerally, and my rage at those who had taken twelve working, acting years from my life, were what motivated me.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Lee. ''I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir'', Penguin (2014) {{ISBN|978-0-399-16930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}}} Her experience with the blacklist scarred her to such an extent that as late as 2002, she would freeze and go into a "near trance" when anyone asked her about her experiences during the McCarthy period.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J. ''Hollywood Left and Right'', Oxford Univ. Press (2011) p. 128; {{ISBN|978-0195181722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's first major achievement, after HUAC officially cleared her, was in the 1960s television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', as [[Stella Chernak]], for which she won an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] in 1966. In 1967, Grant appeared in an episode of ''[[Mission Impossible]]'', portraying the wife of a U.S. diplomat who goes undercover to discredit a rogue diplomat. That same year, she played the distraught widow of a murder victim in the Oscar-winning ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. In 1963, she won acclaim for her stage performance in the off-Broadway production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Maids]]''.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb name|15613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
She received subsequent Academy Award nominations for the dramas ''[[The Landlord]]'' (1970) and ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'' (1976). Her acting range extended into comedy equally well, notably in several roles as an overbearing mother. In ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), a comedy directed by [[Arthur Hiller]] and written by [[Neil Simon]], she played the harassed mother of a bride, with [[Walter Matthau]] as the father. The film was followed by another comedy role as the mother in ''[[Portnoy's Complaint (film)|Portnoy's Complaint]]'' (1972).

Also in 1971, she played cold-blooded killer Leslie Williams in the second episode ("Ransom for a Dead Man") of the [[Peter Falk]] series ''[[List of Columbo episodes|Columbo]]''. She would appear with Falk again on Broadway ''[[Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'', whose playwright Neil Simon said that his "first and only choice" for the part was Grant, who he said was equally at home with dramatists such as [[Chekhov]] or [[Sidney Kingsley]], yet could also be "hilariously funny" when the script called for it, as she was able to portray essential honesty in her acting.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Neil. ''Rewrites'', Simon &amp; Schuster (1996) p. 336)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her most notable roles was as [[Warren Beatty]]'s older lover in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Supporting Actress. The film received mixed reviews, but was Columbia's biggest hit in the studio's 50-year history.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Elizabeth. ''The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941-2002'', McFarland (2004) p. 198&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' was the second film in which Grant acted under director [[Hal Ashby]]. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], comparing her in both films, noted Grant "is such a cool-style comedienne that she's in danger of having people say that she's good, as usual."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pauline Kael|Kael, Pauline]]. ''The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael'', Penguin e-books (2011)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming, however, she did have some serious disagreements with Beatty, who was also the producer, and nearly quit. During one scene, she wanted to play it in a way she felt was more realistic from a woman's perspective, but Beatty disagreed. After thinking about the scene for a few days, she told director Ashby that she could not do it Beatty's way and was quitting. As she was walking out, Beatty stopped her, and asked what was wrong. "I sat down and told him", she said. "He threw up his hands and said, 'Play it your way. What do I know? I'm a man.'"&lt;ref&gt;Biskind, Peter. ''Star: The Life and Wild Times of Warren Beatty'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2010) e-book&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Lee Grant 1975-1.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1975]]
Despite the success of the film, Grant was feeling less secure in Hollywood, as she was then around fifty years old. She writes:
{{quote|I was becoming my own worst enemy as an actor, traumatized onstage and fixated on staying young so I could keep working in film. A woman of a certain age does not play in movies or TV; we're kicked to the side or out.

In March 1971, Grant appeared in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' episode "Ransom for a Dead Man"', and was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress&amp;nbsp;– Miniseries or a Movie. Having been nominated for two performances in the same acting category, she received the award for her other Emmy-nominated performance in the television film, ''The Neon Ceiling''. The only other nominee was [[Colleen Dewhurst]]; in Grant's acceptance speech, she wryly noted, "I must thank Colleen Dewhurst since it takes two of me to equal one of her." {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

During the 1975-76 television season, she starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Fay (TV series)|Fay]]'', which, to her chagrin, was canceled after eight episodes. She made a guest appearance on ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'', in which her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] co-starred. In 1978 she was the lead actress in the sequel, ''[[Damien: Omen II]]''.

Grant successfully moved into directing when she directed the stage play, ''[[The Stronger]]'', in 1976, written by [[August Strindberg]].

===1980s{{ndash}}1990s===
In 1980, Grant directed her first film, ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'', a story about an aging Jewish couple. That debut narrative film was followed by a widely distributed documentary film, "The Willmar 8", which profiled 8 female employees of a bank in Willmar, Minnesota who went on strike to protest pay inequities between male and female bank tellers. She starred a [[HBO]] remake of ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' in 1982, costarring [[Jerry Orbach]], both playing three different characters in three acts. It was filmed before a live audience.&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;Shelley, Peter.

[[File:Lee Grant at F.I.S.T premier 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=.76|left|Grant at the premiere of ''F.I.S.T.'' (April 1978)]]
Actor [[Bruce Dern]], who played alongside her in [[The Big Town (1987 film)|''The Big Town'']] (1987), recalls working with her: "Lee Grant is a fabulous actress. Anytime she works it's a blessing you have her in your movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dern|Dern, Bruce]]. ''Things I've Said, But Probably Shouldn't Have: An Unrepentant Memoir'', Wiley (2007) p. 231&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She directed several documentary films, including ''[[Down and Out in America]]'' (1986) which won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]]. That same year, she directed ''Nobody's Child'', a television movie starring [[Marlo Thomas]] about a woman confined to a mental institution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0335519}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her direction, Grant became the first female director to win the [[Directors Guild of America Award]].&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt;

In 1988, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Women in Film Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wif.org/past-recipients Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120329/http://www.wif.org/past-recipients |date=2011-07-24 }} Women in Film website; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiring her directing and acting skill, actress [[Sissy Spacek]] agreed to act in ''[[Hard Promises (1991 film)|Hard Promises]]'' (1991) "only to work with Grant", although Grant was later replaced as its director.&lt;ref&gt;Jarboe, Jan. "Sissy Spacek's Long Walk Home", ''Texas Monthly'', February 1991, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Grant played Dora Cohn, the mother of [[Roy Cohn]] in the biographical made-for-TV film ''[[Citizen Cohn]]'', which garnered her yet another Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

===2000s–present===
In 2001, Lee Grant portrayed Louise Bonner in [[David Lynch]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Mullholland Drive (film)|Mullholland Drive]]''. From 2004 to 2007, [[Carlin Glynn]], [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]], and Grant served as co-artistic directors for the [[Actors Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Penguin Group (USA), October 18, 2007; {{ISBN|9781101211991}}, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, Grant directed a series of ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]'' episodes for Lifetime Television, that celebrated a diverse range of accomplished women.

In 2013 she returned to the stage, after a nearly forty-year absence, to star in ''[[The Gin Game]]'', part of a benefit for improvement programs at the Island Music Guild. Grant played Fonsia Dorsey opposite [[Frank Buxton]] as Weller Martin; her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] directed the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2013/aug/12/theater-high-powered-cast-deals-this-gin-game/?partner=RSS#axzz2xZu7fd3s|title=Theater: High-powered cast deals this 'Gin Game'|author=Michael C.

==Notes==
{{Notelist|notes=

{{efn|name="birth year note"|Grant was born on October 31, but disagreement exists between sources over the year. While secondary and tertiary sources put Grant's year of birth between 1925 and 1931 she was almost certainly born in the mid-1920s. Public records indicate she was born in 1925 but a ship manifest and congressional testimony favor 1926. Recent interviews with Grant and her autobiography suggest 1927, although Grant herself is inconsistent on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;

''Secondary sources''
* ''Mid-1920s'': The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' notes that Grant is "famously inexact" about her age, as a result of being blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Carrie|last=Rickey|title='I Said Yes to Everything', by Lee Grant|date=July 17, 2014|work=[[SFGate.com]]|quote=Lyova Rosenthal was born in the mid-1920s. The granddaughter of Polish and Russian immigrants is famously inexact about her age. From her mid-20s to her mid-30s, the blacklist left her unemployable in TV and film, so she lied about her years, whatever they were, to remain viable as an actress.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/I-Said-Yes-to-Everything-by-Lee-Grant-5629159.php|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''1926–1930, 1931'': ''[[Who’s Who in America]]'' lists 1931 as Grant's birth year, but ''Great Jews in the Performing Arts'' notes that "Other sources give every year from 1926 through 1930."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl|last=Lyman|title=Great Jews in the Performing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bnQHAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rosenthal+1930 124] |quote=Lee Grant was born in New York City, New York, on October 31, 1931.

====2011–12 season====
Lingard was first included in a senior matchday squad on 30 November 2011, in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] quarter-finals against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Old Trafford]], remaining unused as Sir [[Alex Ferguson]]'s team lost 2–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheringham |first=Sam |title=Manchester United 1–2 Crystal Palace |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15850177 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his only other call-up of the season on 4 January 2012, again unused in a 3–0 away [[Premier League]] loss to [[Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Saj |title=Newcastle 3–0 Man Utd |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16343415 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2012, Lingard and teammate [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]] joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on loan for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/061112-city-squad-bolstered-by-united-loan-double-469523.aspx |title=City Bolstered By United Loan Double |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut later that day, in a 0–0 [[EFL Championship|Championship]] draw away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], coming on as a substitute for [[Martyn Waghorn]] in the 85th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolton 0–0 Leicester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20134517 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His loan was later extended to 2 January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Reds trio extend loan deals |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Dec/michael-keane-and-jesse-lingard-rejoin-leicester.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=5 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he totalled five appearances for the Foxes.

====2013–14 season====
Lingard was selected in the 19-man squad for Manchester United's 2013 pre-season tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-still-hopeful-darren-5066813 |title=Manchester United still hopeful of Darren Fletcher return |first=Stuart |last=Mathieson |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first two goals for United in a 5–1 friendly win against the A-League All Stars in Sydney on 20 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/20/uk-soccer-united-australia-idUKBRE96J04H20130720 |title=United thrash Australia All Stars in friendly |first=Nick |last=Mulvenny |agency=Reuters |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of which was the club's first goal under new manager [[David Moyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/20/manchester-united-aleague-all-stars-win |title=Manchester United thrash A-League All Stars to give David Moyes first win |first=Jamie |last=Jackson |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, he said "I believe in myself but I have to start believing in myself more".&lt;ref name=TourQuotes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-united-youngster-jesse-lingard-told-to-believe-in-himself-8725819.html |title=Manchester United youngster Jesse Lingard told to believe in himself |first=Simon |last=Stone |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |agency=Press Association |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored against [[Yokohama F.

Although he had hoped to "skip the loan stage this time and break straight through" at Manchester United,&lt;ref name=TourQuotes/&gt; Lingard joined [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a month's loan on 19 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24164296 |title=Jesse Lingard: Birmingham City sign Man Utd youngster on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went straight into the starting eleven for the Championship match against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]] two days later. He opened the scoring after 20 minutes with his first goal in senior football when goalkeeper [[Chris Kirkland]] parried [[Chris Burke (footballer)|Chris Burke]]'s shot, completed his [[hat-trick]] 13 minutes later, and scored a fourth in the second half to secure a 4–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24089685 |title=Birmingham 4–1 Sheffield Wed |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingard was unavailable for Birmingham's League Cup third-round tie because Manchester United did not want him [[cup-tied]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-lee-clark-6083766 |title=Lee Clark: We want Jesse Lingard here for as long as possible |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=24 September 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in his third league match, he made up for missing a penalty, awarded when he was fouled apparently outside the area, with an 89th-minute header to complete a 4–0 defeat of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ged |last=Scott |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24246482 |title=Birmingham City 4–0 Millwall |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement was reached to extend Lingard's loan until 14 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24582877 |title=Jesse Lingard: Man Utd youngster to extend Birmingham City loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he then missed three matches while receiving treatment at Manchester United for a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-jesse-lingard-set-6271456 |title=Jesse Lingard return set to boost Birmingham City |last=Tattum |first=Colin |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was further extended, to 1 January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25138529 |title=Man Utd's Jesse Lingard extends Birmingham City loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 November 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lingard was suspended for the last two matches of the spell. Against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 26 December, he was sent off for a lunge on [[Jordi Gómez]] immediately after being refused a free kick when he appeared to be fouled.&lt;ref name=Disappoint&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11694/9089639/sky-bet-championship-birmingham-boss-lee-clark-disappointed-with-jesse-lingard |title=Sky Bet Championship: Birmingham boss Lee Clark disappointed with Jesse Lingard |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Birmingham hoped to extend the loan,&lt;ref name=Disappoint/&gt; Lingard returned to Manchester United and was an unused substitute in the match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on 11 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25600466 |title=Manchester United 2–0 Swansea City |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 2014, Lingard joined another Championship club, [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], on a 93-day loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albion sign Man United's Lingard |url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/brighton-hove-albion-sign-manchester-united-striker-jesse-lingard-1385273.aspx |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=27 February 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on 8 April, in a 4–1 win against former club Leicester City, who had sealed promotion to the Premier League days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City 1–4 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26830309 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While with Albion, Lingard played 17 times, including in the [[EFL Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]], and scored 4 goals.&lt;ref name=sb1314/&gt;

On 4 August 2014, Lingard came off the bench to score the third goal in United's 3–1 [[2014 International Champions Cup|International Champions Cup Final]] win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He made his competitive debut for the club in the first match of the [[2014–15 Premier League]] season at home to Swansea City, starting the match but was replaced by [[Adnan Januzaj]] because of injury after 24 minutes. Swansea won 2–1 in [[Louis van Gaal]]'s first competitive match as United manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Manchester United 1–2 Swansea City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28718345 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Hugo Hoelgebaum Pereira''' (born 1 January 1996) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for English {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]].

Born in [[Duffel]], Belgium, he began his youth career with nearby [[Lommel SK|Lommel United]]. At the age of nine, he joined Dutch club [[PSV Eindhoven]], before signing for Manchester United in November 2011. Pereira made his first Premier League appearance in March 2015. He has spent time on loan at Spanish clubs [[Granada CF|Granada]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].

He played international football for the youth teams of both the country of his birth, Belgium, and his father's homeland, Brazil, before making his senior debut for Brazil in September 2018.

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
====Early years====
The son of former Brazilian professional footballer [[Marcos Antônio Pereira|Marcos Pereira]],&lt;ref name="influenced"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Pereira influenced by dad |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Mar/andreas-pereira-explains-fathers-influence-on-career.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=12 March 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas Pereira was born in [[Duffel]], Belgium, while his father was a player there. He began his career with nearby [[Lommel United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=United set to clinch deal for Brazilian-born PSV hot shot Pereira |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2058378/Manchester-United-sign-PSVs-Andreas-Pereira.html |publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers) |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of his father's former clubs, before moving just across the Dutch border to [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 2005, when he was nine years old. In 2011, after impressing at the [[Manchester United Premier Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Pereira making progress |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Exclusive-Interviews/2014/Mar/andreas-pereira-exclusive-interview-with-inside-united-magazine.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he became a target for several big English clubs, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], but a visit from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] in November 2011 convinced Pereira to sign for the [[Old Trafford]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ewan |last=Murray |title=Alex Ferguson seals recruitment of PSV's Andreas Hoelgebaum Pereira |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/07/alex-ferguson-andreas-hoelgebaum-pereira |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to regulations regarding international transfers, the move could not be completed until Pereira's 16th birthday on 1 January 2012, and further complications with international clearance meant that his Manchester United debut was delayed until April 2012. He made his debut for the under-18s in a league match away to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on 25 April 2012, but heavy rain meant the match had to be abandoned as a goalless draw after 35 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Adam |last1=Marshall |first2=Adam |last2=Bostock |title=U18: Sheff Wed A United A |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/The-Academy/Academy-News/2012/Apr/academy-sheffield-wednesday-v-manchester-united.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made two more appearances that season as the under-18s finished eighth out of 10 teams in their [[Premier Academy League]] group.

After signing as an academy scholar in July 2012, Pereira became a regular in the under-18s in the 2012–13 season, making 20 appearances and scoring five goals. He also got his first taste of reserve team football during the season, coming on as a substitute for [[James Weir (footballer)|James Weir]] in a 3–1 win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the [[Manchester Senior Cup]], followed by another substitute appearance against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the semi-finals of the [[2012–13 Professional U21 Development League|Professional Development League]]. In recognition of his performances, on 7 January 2013, shortly after his 17th birthday, Pereira received his first professional contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Pereira signs pro deal |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/The-Academy/Academy-News/2013/Jan/andreas-pereira-signs-professional-terms.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Pereira was named as Manchester United's captain for their [[2013 Milk Cup]] campaign, and was named Player of the Tournament for his three goals as Manchester United won the Premier Section.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andreas Pereira |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Andreas-Pereira.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to feature heavily for both the under-18s and the under-21s, and was ever present in the inaugural [[2013–14 UEFA Youth League|UEFA Youth League]]; he also scored twice in three appearances in the [[FA Youth Cup]], including a curling, 25-yard effort against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the third round.&lt;ref name="introducing"&gt;{{cite news |title=Introducing: Andreas Pereira |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/United-Uncovered/News/2013/Dec/Issue-47/Introducing-Andreas-Pereira-Manchester-United-Under18s-midfielder.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=20 December 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the under-21s, he appeared in 17 out of 21 league matches as Manchester United finished third; he then scored the only goal in the semi-final against Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=U21: Liverpool 0 United 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2014/May/liverpool-v-manchester-united-under-21-semi-final-match-report.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only for the team to lose to Chelsea in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=U21s: United 1 Chelsea 2 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2014/May/manchester-united-v-chelsea-under-21-final-match-report.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereira began the 2014–15 season with silverware as Manchester United beat [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 4–1 in the final of the Manchester Senior Cup on 7 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=MSC: City 1 United Reserves 4 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2014/Aug/match-report-manchester-senior-cup-final-city-v-united.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut three weeks later, coming on as a half-time substitute for [[Saidy Janko]] in a 4–0 away defeat to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in the second round of the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MK Dons 4-0 Man Utd |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28847955 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2015, Pereira made his [[Premier League]] debut against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], coming on as a 77th-minute substitute for [[Juan Mata]] in a 3–0 win for United.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31785852 |title=Manchester United 3–0 Tottenham Hotspur |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May, he signed a new contract with Manchester United until at least June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Andreas Pereira signs new contract |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/May/Andreas-Pereira-signs-new-contract.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=2 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen days later, Pereira was voted Manchester United's under-21 player of the year for 2014–15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Mark |last1=Froggatt |first2=Adam |last2=Bostock |title=Pereira wins U21s Player of the Year award |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/May/Andreas-Pereira-wins-Manchester-United-Under-21s-Player-of-the-Year-award.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
On 21 July, Pereira scored his first goal for Manchester United's senior squad in the 3–1 win against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the [[2015 International Champions Cup]], after coming on as a second-half substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=United 3 Earthquakes 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Tour-2015/News-and-Features/2015/Jul/Manchester-United-vs-San-Jose-Earthquakes-match-report-21-july-2015.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first competitive start for the senior team on 23 September 2015, in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], and scored a free kick in the eventual 3–0 win over [[Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Utd 3-0 Ipswich|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34265442|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season (loan to Granada)====
On 26 August 2016, Pereira joined Spanish club [[Granada CF|Granada]] on a season-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Aug/andreas-pereira-set-to-be-loaned-to-granada-in-la-liga.aspx|title=Pereira to seal loan move to Granada|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|date=26 August 2016|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in [[La Liga]] two days later, replacing [[Luís Martins (footballer, born 1992)|Luís Martins]] in the 55th minute of a 5–1 loss at [[UD Las Palmas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Las Palmas es líder 38 años después y presume de pegada|trans-title=Las Palmas is leader for first time in 38 years and makes a mark|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2016/08/28/primera/1472397272_461450.html|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=[[Diario AS]]|date=29 August 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian Andreas Pereira says he joined Granada for its playing style|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/brazilian-andreas-pereira-says-he-joined-granada-for-its-playing-style|accessdate=10 March 2017|publisher=Sportskeeda|date=30 August 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faustino Marcos Alberto Rojo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈmaɾkoz ˈroxo}};{{efn-ua|In isolation, ''Marcos'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|ˈmaɾkos|}}.}} born 20 March 1990) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for English {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]].

He began his career at local club [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], where he won the [[Copa Libertadores]] in 2009 and played in the [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup Final|Club World Cup Final]] later that year. After a short spell with [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] he joined [[Sporting CP]] in 2012, and transferred to Manchester United for £16&amp;nbsp;million two years later.

Rojo made his first appearance for Argentina at senior level in 2011 and has since earned over 50 caps. He was part of their side which reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]], and was the only Argentine included in the [[Castrol Performance Index]] Team of the Tournament. He was also a [[Copa América]] runner-up in [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and [[Copa América Centenario|2016]] and took part at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Estudiantes LP===
Rojo grew up in [[La Plata]], Argentina and joined his local side [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] at the age of ten.&lt;ref name=pickup/&gt;

In 2009, he was promoted to the club's main team, after signing his first professional contract. He spent three years with the club, making 43 appearances and scoring three goals for the team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espnfc.com/player/129426/marcos-rojo, Marcos Rojo – Player Profile, [[ESPN FC]]&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup Final]], coming on for extra time as Estudiantes lost 2–1 to [[FC Barcelona]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estduiantes 1–2 Barcelona|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/uae2009/matches/round=252913/match=300111971/index.html|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Estudiantes, Rojo won a [[Copa Libertadores]] and an [[Argentine Primera División]] title. The defender spent most matches at [[left back]] and developed a reputation as a capable attacker, scoring his first goal in a 2–1 defeat against [[LDU Quito]] in the [[2010 Recopa Sudamericana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liga de Quito gana 2-1 a Estudiantes, en juego de ida de la Recopa Sudamericana|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-7880081|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=El Tiempo|date=25 August 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spartak Moscow===
[[File:Marcos Rojo 6127.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rojo playing for [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in March 2011.]]
In December 2010, Rojo signed a five-year contract with [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Попов: с Рохо в России можно сравнить разве что Луковича|url=http://www.championat.com/football/news-685686.html|publisher=Championat|accessdate=12 August 2014|language=Russian|date=19 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924150333/http://www.championat.com/football/news-685686.html|archivedate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his only goal for Spartak on 20 April 2011, netting the opening goal of a 2–1 defeat of [[FC Krasnodar|Krasnodar]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010–11 Russian Cup#Quarterfinals|Russian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2011/04/20/russia/cup/fk-spartak-moskva/fk-krasnodar/1086566/ |title=Spartak Moskva vs. Krasnodar 2–1 |work=Soccerway |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporting CP===
In July 2012, Rojo moved from Spartak Moscow to [[Sporting CP]] for £3.5&amp;nbsp;million, signing a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/91/portugal/2012/07/20/3252963/sporting-lisbon-swoop-for-spartak-moscow-defender-marcos |title=Sporting Lisbon swoop for Spartak Moscow defender Marcos Rojo |publisher=Goal |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rojo made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut for Sporting on 19 August 2012, playing the entire match and receiving a yellow card in a 0–0 draw with [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/08/19/portugal/portuguese-liga-/vitoria-guimaraes/sporting-clube-de-portugal/1316779/ |title=VITÓRIA GUIMARÃES VS. SPORTING CP 0 – 0 |work=Soccerway |date=19 August 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first red card for Sporting in a league match against [[FC Porto|Porto]] on 7 October 2012, picking up two cautions within three minutes as Sporting fell to a 2–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/10/07/portugal/portuguese-liga-/futebol-clube-do-porto/sporting-clube-de-portugal/1316817/ |title=Porto vs. Sporting CP 2–0 |work=Soccerway |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Sporting on 28 April 2013, netting the winner against [[C.D.

Marcos Rojo|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/everything-you-need-know-about-marcos-rojo|accessdate=8 February 2015|work=[[Four Four Two]]|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; finishing seventh in the [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|league]].

In the second league match of the [[2013–14 Sporting Clube de Portugal season|2013–14 season]], Rojo scored his first goal of the season, netting Sporting's second goal in their 4–0 win over [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica de Coimbra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/08/24/portugal/portuguese-liga-/associacao-academica-de-coimbra/sporting-clube-de-portugal/1511712/ |title=Académica vs. Sporting CP 0–4 |work=Soccerway |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2014, Rojo was sent off in a Primeira Liga match against [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]], but Sporting held on for a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/04/19/portugal/portuguese-liga-/clube-futebol--os-belenenses/sporting-clube-de-portugal/1511924/ |title=Belenenses vs. Sporting Club |work=Soccerway |date=19 April 2014 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an improved season, he contributed six goals as Sporting finished as runners-up.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

On 13 August 2014, it was announced that Rojo was being disciplined by his club over his refusal to train after handing in a transfer request to force through a move to [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28763841 |title=Manchester United try to resolve Marcos Rojo stand-off |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2014 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporting president Bruno de Carvalho later alleged that third-party owners of Rojo who were not representatives of Manchester United had pressured his club into selling the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester United: Sporting reveal Marcos Rojo sale 'pressure'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29474696|accessdate=4 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
On 19 August 2014, an agreement to sell Rojo for €20&amp;nbsp;million (£16&amp;nbsp;million) was announced by both Sporting and Manchester United.&lt;ref name=sporting_confirmation&gt;{{cite web|title=Da venda de Marcos Rojo para o Man.Utd, 9M€ irão para a construção do nosso Pavilhão|trans-title=From the sale of Marcos Rojo to Man.Utd, €9M will go towards the construction of our Pavilion|url=https://twitter.com/Sporting_CP/status/501788409745403904|website=twitter.com|publisher=Sporting CP|accessdate=19 August 2014|language=Portuguese|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cmvm_document1&gt;{{cite web|title=COMUNICADO|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR51803.pdf|website=cmvm.pt|publisher=Portuguese Securities Market Commission|accessdate=19 August 2014|language=Portuguese|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=man_utd_confirmation&gt;{{cite web|title=#mufc has reached agreement with Sporting Lisbon to sign defender Marcos Rojo, subject to a medical and personal terms.|url=https://twitter.com/ManUtd/status/501800168849948672|website=twitter.com|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|accessdate=19 August 2014|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, United announced that they had signed him on a five-year contract, with [[Nani]] moving to Sporting on a season-long loan. Rojo stated that it was a "dream come true" to play with Manchester United.&lt;ref name="Manchester United sign Marcos Rojo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United sign Marcos Rojo for £16m on five-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28858116|website=bbc.co.uk/sport|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 August 2014| date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marcos Rojo: Overview |url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/10472/Marcos-Rojo/overview |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rojo missed three matches for United due to difficulties in gaining a [[work permit]], because of pending criminal charges in Argentina, where he is alleged to have had an altercation with a neighbour in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keegan|first1=Mike|title=Marcos Rojo: Man United signing's debut held up by visa delay|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29000089|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September, he was granted a work permit by the [[UK Border Agency]] to work in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-united/story/2019765/marcos-rojo-granted-work-permit-to-play-for-manchester-united |title=Marcos Rojo granted work permit to play for Manchester United |work=ESPNFC |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later he made his debut at [[Old Trafford]] as United won for the first time in the season, playing the entirety of the 4–0 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 4–0 QPR |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29098240 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2014 |accessdate=16 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rojo was stretchered off in United's 1–0 defeat in the [[Manchester derby]] on 2 November, sustaining shoulder damage from a tackle on [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]'s [[Martín Demichelis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Man City 1–0 Man Utd|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29775977|accessdate=2 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed that he had dislocated his shoulder, adding to United's defensive injuries alongside [[Jonny Evans]] and [[Phil Jones (footballer, born 1992)|Phil Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos Rojo: Manchester United defender dislocates shoulder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29873143|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2015, Rojo scored his first goal for United, heading a ball played by [[Robin van Persie]] for the second goal of a 3–0 win over [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] in an [[2014–15 FA Cup|FA Cup]] fourth round replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cryer|first1=Andy|title=Man Utd 3–0 Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30991120|accessdate=3 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cskamu 21.jpg|thumb|right|Rojo taking a throw-in for Manchester United in the [[2015-16 UEFA Champions League|2015-16 Champions League]].]]
During Manchester United's 2015 pre-season tour of North America, Rojo was expected to join up with the rest of the squad following an extended break granted after competing for Argentina in the Copa América. However, passport issues reportedly caused Rojo to miss pre-season tour entirely, and the matter was said to have "angered" manager [[Louis van Gaal]]. Rojo was resultantly fined £140,000 for failing to join up with the rest of the squad on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Samuel |last=Lovett |title=Marcos Rojo faces £140,000 fine for missing Manchester United's US pre-season tour |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/marcos-rojo-faces-140000-fine-for-missing-manchester-uniteds-us-pre-season-tour-10420525.html |website=independent.co.uk |publisher=Independent Digital News &amp; Media |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], which United won 2–1 after extra time against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], Rojo was booked in the first half for fouling [[Pape Souaré]] and was substituted for [[Matteo Darmian]] after 66 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Manchester United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36292265|accessdate=6 April 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rojo was named by [[Jorge Sampaoli]] in the Argentina squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced?|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June, he scored the winning goal in Argentina's 2–1 triumph over Nigeria, which secured the team's qualification for the knockout stage as group runners-up behind [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/06/26/nigeria-vs-argentina-world-cup-2018-live-score-lionel-messi/|title=Marcos Rojo saves Argentina's World Cup dream with late winner to send Nigeria home|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the round of 16 match against [[France national football team|France]] on 30 June, he was booked after conceding a penalty in the 10th minute for a foul on [[Kylian Mbappé]], which was later converted by [[Antoine Griezmann]], who opened the scoring.

==Style of play==
According to ''[[Four Four Two]]'' magazine, Rojo was more comfortable at [[left back]] rather than [[centre back]] in his first season at Sporting, due to a number of positional errors and mistimed tackles; in his second season, his speed helped him in defence.&lt;ref name=four/&gt; They also attributed a good aerial threat to him, while noting that disciplinary problems remained.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

In addition to his usual positions at centre-back and left-back, Rojo can play as a [[winger (association football)|winger]]. On signing for Manchester United, it was theorised that he could feature as a [[wing-back (association football)|wing-back]] in [[Louis van Gaal]]'s preferred 3–5–2 formation.&lt;ref name=pickup&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pickup|first1=Oliver|title=Marcos Rojo: 13 things you might not know about Manchester United transfer target|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11030599/Marcos-Rojo-13-things-you-might-not-know-about-Manchester-United-transfer-target.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cutler|first1=Teddy|title=Marcos Rojo profile: Who is the £16m Manchester United signing?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/marcos-rojo-profile-who-is-the-15m-manchester-united-target-9664886.html|accessdate=8 February 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Rojo is married to Eugenia Lusardo, a lingerie model based in [[Lisbon]]. They have a daughter.&lt;ref name=pickup/&gt;

Rojo has a number of [[tattoos]], including the English words "Pride" and "Glory" on each thigh.&lt;ref name=pickup/&gt;

In December 2014, Rojo had an affair with a woman he had met at a night club. He accused her of [[blackmail]] and took out an [[injunction]] to stop newspapers publishing his name in the story. The injunction on his name was lifted in April 2015 due to concerns that other footballers could be suspected of the affair, but it remains in place to prevent the release of images of Rojo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Manchester United's Marcos Rojo named as footballer in sex scandal court case|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/manchester-uniteds-marcos-rojo-named-as-footballer-in-sex-scandal-court-case-10158407.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley Simon Young''' (born 9 July 1985) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder#Winger|winger]], [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full back]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Born and raised in Hertfordshire, Young started his career at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], making his first senior appearances in 2003 under the management of [[Ray Lewington]]. He became a first-team regular in 2004–05, and was one of Watford's key players in their promotion winning 2005–06 season. Young continued to play well for Watford in the Premier League, and in January 2007 he transferred to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for an £8&amp;nbsp;million fee, rising to £9.65&amp;nbsp;million with add-ons. He established himself in the first team at [[Villa Park]] and won the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award in 2009. On 23 June 2011, Young signed for Manchester United for an undisclosed fee. He has gone on to win every trophy available in English football, winning the [[FA Community Shield]] in 2011, the Premier League in 2013, the [[FA Cup]] in 2016 and the [[EFL Cup]] in 2017. In May 2017, he won European silverware as part of the United squad that lifted the [[UEFA Europa League]].

Young represented England at [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level and has since earned 39 senior [[Cap (sport)|caps]], scoring 7 goals.

==Club career==
===Watford===
Young joined the [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] academy system at 10 years of age. He developed there until the summer of 2001, when he was informed by the club that he wouldn't receive a full scholarship and could look for another team. Despite being turned away, Young stayed on at the club on a part-time basis and endeavoured to improve himself as a player and prove he could make it to the first team. He started to train with the Under-18s, despite being 16, and was starting games by the end of the season. He progressed on to the Under-21s and was eventually offered a professional deal by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=26 March 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2011/03/cardiff_england_arrived_in_wal.html |title=Phil McNulty: England ease pressure on Capello |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=26 March 2011 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Froggart |title=How early rejection inspired Ashley Young |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fanzone/News-And-Blogs/2015/Jun/Mark-Froggatt-blog-on-Ashley-Young-joining-United-in-2011.aspx |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035932/http://www.manutd.com/en/Fanzone/News-And-Blogs/2015/Jun/Mark-Froggatt-blog-on-Ashley-Young-joining-United-in-2011.aspx# |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18-year-old was handed his first-team debut under [[Ray Lewington]] in September 2003, scoring as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=23 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6282041.stm |title=Young tipped for big Villa impact |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=20 August 2008 |first=Charlie |last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved five substitute appearances that season, scoring three goals, and made his first start for the club in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. Young came to prominence in the 2004–05 season, playing a part in 34 of Watford's league matches as they struggled to survive in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. Although he failed to find the net, his performance during this season earned him the club's Young Player of the Season award.&lt;ref name="TheFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/Y/Ashley-Young |title=Ashley Young |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Aidy Boothroyd]] in the 2005–06 season, Young was given a new lease of life as a striker and right winger. Young started 41 League matches, finding the net 15 times, including a playoff semi-final goal against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], as Watford qualified for the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] and eventually beat [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 3–0 to gain promotion to the [[Premier League]]. During that season, Young scored a number of spectacular goals, including free-kicks against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and Leeds, a shot into the top corner from 30 yards out against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], and a curling shot against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. It was during this season, though, that Young was sent off for the first time in his career, in the local derby away at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].

Young began Watford's [[2006–07 Watford F.C. season|2006–07]] Premier League season well, scoring three times in the league, including a last minute strike in a 3–3 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (he had also scored Watford's second goal in the match), and a goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]  , in Watford's first win of the season in October. He also scored a free-kick in the League Cup. In the January 2007 transfer window, three unnamed clubs made £5&amp;nbsp;million offers for the under-21 international.&lt;ref name = "Bale"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/united-lead-chase-for-bale-as-young-attracts-1635m-bids-430672.html |title=United lead chase for Bale as Young attracts £5m bids |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 January 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watford rejected these approaches, as well as an offer of £7&amp;nbsp;million, again from an unnamed club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=12 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/6230073.stm |title=Watford reject £7m bid for Young |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved offer of nearly £10&amp;nbsp;million from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] was accepted. However, Young rejected the move, opting to wait for offers from clubs for whom relegation was not an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=15 January 2007 |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premiership/2006-2007/sport_sto1055878.shtml |title=Young rejects Hammers move |publisher=Eurosport |accessdate=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2007, Aston Villa completed the signing of Young for a fee of £8&amp;nbsp;million (rising to £9.65&amp;nbsp;million with add-ons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Young completes £9.65m Villa move |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6277389.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 January 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this was the highest fee Aston Villa had ever paid for a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aston Villa: Martin O'Neill's signings – where are they now? |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-martin-onell-transfers-12715345 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2007, he scored on his debut for Villa at [[St James' Park]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], but Villa went on to lose 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Newcastle 3–1 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6309683.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young started the [[2007–08 Aston Villa F.C. season|2007–08 season]] well, receiving several Man of the Match awards, culminating in a call-up to the England squad.

In the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 Premier League season]], Young finished second to [[Cesc Fàbregas]] in assists with 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Statistics|publisher=Premier League|url=http://www.premierleague.com/wiki/Statistics | accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was included in the Premier League Team of the Year, and apart from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]'s [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]], was the only other player who did not come from any of the 'Big Four' ([[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) to make it into the best XI of the season.&lt;ref name=PFA0708&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronaldo named player of the year |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7370319.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2008, Young scored two goals and assisted two goals for Aston Villa against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at [[Villa Park]] and Villa went on to win the match 5–1. He also scored the winner against Danish club [[Odense Boldklub]] in Villa's home leg of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] third round. On 10 October 2008, Young won the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award. This was due to his performances in the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 Premier League season]]. Having also won the award in April 2008, Young joins the list of players who have won the award more than once including [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Steven Gerrard]]. On 7 December 2008, in the 3–2 win over Everton, Young scored two goals, one being an injury time winner after [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Joleon Lescott]] had equalised seconds earlier putting his tally for the season up to five. Manager [[Martin O'Neill]] later described the player as being 'world-class' in the post-match press conference. Young signed a new four-year contract until 2012 on 4 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=4 November 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7708999.stm |title=Young signs four-year Villa deal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2009, Young was again awarded the Premier League Player of the Month award for December, along with O'Neill, who won the Manager of the Month award.

[[File:AshleyYoung.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Young training with Aston Villa in 2009]]

On 24 August 2009, Young scored a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] as Aston Villa won 3–1 against Liverpool at [[Anfield]]. He did, however, miss a penalty three days later in a home tie in the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] against [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]. Young won two penalties in the first half of the match (one that he missed, the other that was converted by [[James Milner]]) as Aston Villa were eliminated from the tournament on the away goals rule.

During the 2010–11 season, Young became [[captain (association football)|vice-captain]] of the club and played in a new free role behind the striker, allowing him to move from wing to wing and through the centre. Young scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season with a direct free-kick in the Premier League match at home to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 18 September 2010. He ended the season with nine goals and fourteen assists in 39 appearances for Villa in all competitions. With one year left to run on his current contract, Young stated that he would not make a decision on his future until the end of the season. On 20 June 2011, new Villa manager [[Alex McLeish]] admitted that he was resigned to losing Young, stating, "It's not confirmed yet but it does seem likely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/8466/1/exclusive-mcleish-villa-dont-want-lose-downing |title=Exclusive&amp;nbsp;– McLeish: 'Villa don't want to lose Downing' |publisher=Talksport |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That match went to extra time, but Young was replaced by [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]] 12 minutes into the additional period and played no part in the penalty shoot-out after the match finished as a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Colombia 1-1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44610244 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 July 2018 |accessdate=5 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England won 4–3 on penalties and progressed to a quarter-final against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], against whom Young again played the full 90 minutes as England won 2–0, with Young providing the assist for [[Harry Maguire]]'s opening goal from a corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Sweden 0-2 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44665445 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 July 2018 |accessdate=5 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-final against Croatia, Young again started the match, but was against replaced by Rose at the start of extra time, with the score at 1–1 after 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Croatia 2-1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44706648 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 July 2018 |accessdate=5 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England ultimately lost the match 2–1 after extra time, and Southgate chose to rest Young for the third-place play-off against Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Belgium 2-0 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44748604 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 July 2018 |accessdate=5 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England lost again, but their fourth place finish was their best performance at a FIFA World Cup since 1990.

==Style of play==
Young has played in a variety of positions: though chiefly a [[winger (association football)|winger]],&lt;ref name="Bale" /&gt; he has also experienced game-time as a [[forward (association football)|forward]]–under Boothroyd at Watford and once under Van Gaal at Manchester United&lt;ref name="MUFW1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MUFW2" /&gt;– as well as in a free role behind the striker for Aston Villa.

During his later years at United, Young was re-invented as a [[defender (association football)|defender]], deployed as a left-sided full back or wing back. ''WhoScored'''s Martin Laurence stated in 2018 that "[[Luke Shaw]] can’t get a kick at Manchester United and that is down to the form of Ashley Young, who has adapted to another new role superbly. Young is now proving to be an aggressive and intelligent defender, all while still offering a threat going forwards with his delivery into the box. On current form the 32-year-old shouldn’t just make the cut, but be considered as England’s first choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The outsiders who deserve England call-ups – and the regulars who don't|first=Martin|last=Laurence|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=22 March 2018|date=14 March 2018|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2018/mar/14/england-squad-netherlands-italy-gareth-southgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than being deployed as a left-back, Young had also being deployed as a right-back. On 12 September 2017 Young was being deployed as a right-back in a 3–0 win against Basel in the Champions League, assisting with the opening goal with a cross to Marouane Fellaini in the 35th minute, Young was also captain for the match.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ashley Young has courted controversy, having been accused of [[Diving (association football)|diving]] by the press and has been spoken to by former managers [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] and [[David Moyes]] about diving to gain an unfair advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/20/alex-ferguson-has-word-ashley-young |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 'has word' with Ashley Young over diving accusations |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |agency=Press Association |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24097097 |title=Ashley Young: David Moyes in diving warning to Man Utd winger |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Young was born in [[Stevenage]], Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/players/ashley-young-20572/ |title=Ashley Young |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one older brother&lt;ref name=Indy081006&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ashley-young-meet-stevenages-second-greatest-sporting-prodigy-952525.html |title=Ashley Young: Meet Stevenage's second greatest sporting prodigy |newspaper=The Independent |first=Brian |last=Viner |date=6 October 2008 |accessdate=15 September 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two football-playing younger brothers, [[Lewis Young|Lewis]], who made his debut for Watford in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Watford team profiles: Lewis Young |url=http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10400~43897,00.html |publisher=Watford F.C. |accessdate=20 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918065527/http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0%2C%2C10400~43897%2C00.html |archive-date=18 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyle, who in April 2009 was training at the [[Arsenal F.C.

He began his career at [[Real Zaragoza]], before moving to [[Athletic Bilbao]] in 2011 and then to Manchester United for €36&amp;nbsp;million in 2014. He has since won four trophies, including the [[2016 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], [[2017 EFL Cup Final|EFL Cup]] and [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]], and was named the club's player of the year for the 2016–17 season.

He has also won tournaments with Spain at [[Spain national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21]] level and represented the nation at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]]. He made his [[Spain national football team|senior]] international debut in November 2016.

==Club career==

===Real Zaragoza===
Born in [[Bilbao]], Herrera began his football career at [[Real Zaragoza]] and made his professional debut in the [[Segunda División]] in the [[2008–09 Segunda División|2008–09 season]]. He made 19 appearances that season as the Aragonese club made an immediate return to [[La Liga]]. He made his top-flight debut on 29 August 2009, in a 1–0 home win against [[CD Tenerife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Zaragoza regresa a Primera con Victoria |trans-title=Zaragoza returns to ''Primera'' with win |url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2009/08/29/mas_futbol/1251496868_850215.html |publisher=Diario AS |language=Spanish |date=29 August 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 campaign]], Herrera was one of Real Zaragoza's most used players as the club managed to retain its top-flight status. He scored his first league goal on 6 December, but in a 4–1 away defeat to [[RCD Mallorca]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/275931?cc=5739 Mallorca maintain home run]; [[ESPN Soccernet]], 6 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11]], Herrera continued to feature regularly for Real Zaragoza, under both [[José Aurelio Gay]] and his successor [[Javier Aguirre]].

===Athletic Bilbao===
On 7 February 2011, he agreed to join [[Athletic Bilbao]] on a five-year contract for a reported €7.5&amp;nbsp;million effective as of 1 July. Buyout clauses were set at €36&amp;nbsp;million in his first three seasons and €40&amp;nbsp;million in the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/877509/athletic-bilbao-confirm-deal-to-sign-ander-herrera?cc=5739 Athletic confirm Herrera deal]; ESPN Soccernet, 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrera made his official debut for Athletic Bilbao on 18 August 2011, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against [[Trabzonspor]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]]. He appeared in 54 official matches and scored four goals in his first season with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] club, who reached the finals of both the [[2012 Copa del Rey Final|Copa del Rey]] and the [[2012 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League]]. In his third and [[2013–14 La Liga|final season]] he played 33 league games as Athletic qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in 16 years.

===Manchester United===
====Transfer====
Herrera was the subject of a [[Pound sterling|£]]24&amp;nbsp;million offer from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in August 2013, but the bid was rejected by Athletic Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United move for Ander Herrera and 'bid for Daniele De Rossi' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/30/manchester-united-ander-herrera-bilbao |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Manchester United tried to sign him again. On 26 June 2014, Athletic Bilbao announced on their official website that they had rejected a €36&amp;nbsp;million (£28.85&amp;nbsp;million) bid from Manchester United for Herrera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rechazada oferta del Manchester United |trans-title=Offer from Manchester United dismissed |url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/cas/noticias/14333/rechazada-oferta-del-manchester-united.html |language=Spanish |publisher=athletic-club.net |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletic Bilbao later confirmed that Herrera had activated his buyout clause, allowing United to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Herrera pays release clause |url=http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=1&amp;d=1000&amp;berria=14335&amp;idi=2 |publisher=athletic-club.net (Athletic Bilbao) |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United announced on the same day they had completed the signing of Herrera on a four-year contract, pending the receipt of an International Transfer Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jun/ander-herrera-signs-for-manchester-united.aspx|title=Club statement on Ander Herrera|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Racing Club===

Born in [[Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones|Bernardo de Irigoyen]], Argentina, Romero began his youth career at [[Almirante Brown de Isidro Casanova|Almirante Brown]] and [[Comisión de Actividades Infantiles|CAI]] before joining [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]].&lt;ref name="Romero1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sergioromero.net/es/biografia-de-sergio-romero |title=Biografia = Sergio Romero |publisher=Sergio Romero.net |language=Spanish |accessdate=24 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814102003/http://www.sergioromero.net/es/biografia-de-sergio-romero |archivedate=14 August 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero passed from the youth to the first team of Racing Club in 2006, making his debut in the [[Argentine Primera División]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Un estreno sin brillo: quedaron a mano |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/770278-un-estreno-sin-brillo-quedaron-a-mano |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=3 January 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero appeared in the substitute bench throughout the 2005 season.&lt;ref name="Romero1"/&gt; Throughout the 2006 season, he continued to be in the substitute bench. Despite this, he signed his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref name="Romero1"/&gt;

In the 2007 season, Romero found himself competing the first-choice goalkeeper role with [[José Luis Martínez Gullotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El primer objetivo del Piojo: ponerse a punto físicamente |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/876892-el-primer-objetivo-del-piojo-ponerse-a-punto-fisicamente |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero made his Racing Club debut of Matchday 1 of [[2006–07 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|Torneo Apertura]], in a 1–1 draw against [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La Academia, en una visita complicada |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/882647-la-academia-en-una-visita-complicada |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following match, Romero lost his first-choice goalkeeper role to [[Gustavo Campagnuolo]] and spent two months on the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El debut del Piojo López está cada vez más cerca |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/883432-el-debut-del-piojo-lopez-esta-cada-vez-mas-cerca |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks after signing for AZ when he moved in the summer, Romero made his first appearance in two months on 14 April 2007 against [[Club Atlético Colón|Colón]], in a 1–1 draw; followed up by another appearance on 22 April 2007, in a 3–3 draw against [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dale para adelante que confiamos en vos |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/900131-dale-para-adelante-que-confiamos-en-vos |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pasó de todo, pero se fue por lo que se vio en la cancha |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/902447-paso-de-todo-pero-se-fue-por-lo-que-se-vio-en-la-cancha |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=22 April 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Campagnuolo suffered an injury, Romero made his last appearance for the club on 17 June 2007, in a 4–2 win over [[Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba|Godoy Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Por las canchas |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/917549-por-las-canchas |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Racing triunfó y alimentó su ilusión |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/918247-racing-triunfo-y-alimento-su-ilusion |publisher=La Nacion |language=Spanish |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AZ===
[[File:SergioRomero.jpg|thumb|Sergio Romero with AZ in 2007]]
It was announced on 24 March 2007 that Romero signed for [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]], managed by [[Louis van Gaal]], when he joined up the club on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pese a todo, apoyo a Merlo y al Piojo |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/894204-pese-a-todo-apoyo-a-merlo-y-al-piojo |publisher=La Nacion |language=Dutch |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Romero was expected to fight for the first-choice goalkeeper role with [[Boy Waterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.az.nl/index.php?module=news&amp;articleID=20863 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517115526/http://www.az.nl/index.php?module=news&amp;articleID=20863 |title=AZ legt keepers Waterman en Romero vast |archivedate=17 May 2007 |date=29 April 2007 |publisher=AZ |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke Paul Hoare Shaw''' (born 12 July 1995) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Originally a member of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[Southampton F.C. Under-23s and Academy|youth system]], Shaw made his first-team debut for the club in January 2012, and signed his first professional contract in May that year before becoming a regular in the Southampton team over the next two seasons. In June 2014, Shaw was signed by Manchester United for £30&amp;nbsp;million, then a [[Transfer (association football)#Players|world record transfer fee]] for a teenager.

On 5 March 2014, he made his senior international debut for the England team in a 1–0 friendly win against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and later that year was selected in the squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Shaw was born in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sami |last=Mokbel |title=Exclusive: Chelsea set to land £10m replacement for Cole – Southampton teen sensation Shaw |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2284192/Chelsea-set-land-10m-Southampton-teenager-Luke-Shaw-replace-Ashley-Cole.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=25 February 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Rydens Enterprise School]] in [[Hersham]], Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birthday boy Shaw signs on |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/birthday-boy-shaw-signs-on-911473.aspx |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=12 July 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up as a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] supporter, and has claimed that he originally wanted to play for the London club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/shaw-savouring-chelsea-contest-740468.aspx |title=Shaw Savouring Chelsea Contest |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=29 March 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an eight-year-old Shaw played at Chelsea's development centre in [[Guildford]], but was not offered an academy place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10514910/Chelsea-expected-to-make-20m-move-for-Southamptons-Luke-Shaw-during-January-transfer-window.html |title=Chelsea expected to make £20m move for Southampton's Luke Shaw during January transfer window |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 December 2013 |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Southampton===
====Early career====
Shaw joined the [[Southampton F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Southampton Academy]] at the age of eight, and became a regular in the under-18 team from the age of 15.&lt;ref name=officialprofile&gt;{{cite web |title=Luke Shaw |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/team/player-profile/luke-shaw/23 |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first association with the first team came in September 2011, when he was an unused substitute in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref name=officialprofile/&gt; During the January 2012 transfer window, it was reported that Premier League clubs [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Chelsea, and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] had shown interest in signing 16-year-old Shaw, with the then-[[EFL Championship|Championship]] club reportedly valuing the defender at £4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Wallace |title=Arsenal face a battle for Saints' £4m teen |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-face-a-battle-for-saints-4m-teen-6287747.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton quickly responded to such claims though, with then-manager [[Nigel Adkins]] assuring the media that "Luke Shaw is a big part of our future plans", and claiming that the club had "no intention … of letting any of [their] young players move on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luke Shaw will not be sold says Nigel Adkins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16543255 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Shaw made his debut for the Southampton first team on 28 January 2012 in the [[2011–12 FA Cup|FA Cup]], replacing winger [[Jason Puncheon]] for the final 13 minutes of the third round tie against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], which finished 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16664140 |title=Millwall 1–1 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the club's promotion to the top flight in May 2012, Shaw was one of four youth players offered a professional contract for their return to the Premier League, along with [[Jack Stephens (footballer)|Jack Stephens]], [[Calum Chambers]] and [[James Ward-Prowse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southampton promote academy quartet to first team squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18176183 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defender made his first start for the Southampton first team in August 2012, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–1 win over [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] in the League Cup,&lt;ref name=officialprofile/&gt; and on 10 November 2012, he became the youngest Southampton player to start a match in the Premier League when he was chosen to play at left-back against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], completing 74 minutes of the 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dewi |last=Hughes |title=Southampton 1–1 Swansea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20189996 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2012 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw continued to make regular appearances throughout the season, and in manager Nigel Adkins's final match as Southampton manager on 16 January 2013, he set up the second goal in a 2–2 draw away to Chelsea, providing a cross from the left wing for Jason Puncheon to convert in the 75th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20955084 |title=Chelsea 2–2 Southampton |last=Bevan |first=Chris |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an away match against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in March 2013, Shaw was involved in a collision with striker [[Grant Holt]], which resulted in conceding a penalty in the first minute of injury time at the end of the match, although [[Artur Boruc]] saved the ensuing spot kick to ensure the match ended goalless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21639524 |title=Norwich 0–0 Southampton |last=Ornstein |first=David |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw finished his first professional season with 28 appearances for Southampton, including 25 in the Premier League.&lt;ref name=officialprofile/&gt;

In the first match of the [[2013–14 Southampton F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Shaw was directly involved in the goal that saw Southampton win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] when he was fouled in the penalty area by [[Youssouf Mulumbu]] in the 89th minute, with [[Rickie Lambert]] converting the resulting spot kick to see the Saints edge victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644676 |title=West Brom 0–1 Southampton |last=Johnston |first=Ben |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
====2014–15 season====
On 27 June 2014, Shaw signed a four-year contract (with an option to extend for a further year) with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £30&amp;nbsp;million, becoming the most expensive teenager in world football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9363721/premier-league-manchester-united-buy-luke-shaw-from-southampton-for-16330m |title=Manchester United buy Luke Shaw from Southampton for £30m |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=De Menezes |first=Jack |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/luke-shaw-to-manchester-united-confirmed-england-defender-completes-30m-move-from-southampton-9568357.html |title=Luke Shaw joins Manchester United: England defender completes £30m move from Southampton |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea were also interested in Shaw, but they backed away from a deal fearing the teenager's excessive pay demands would cause friction in their dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=José Mourinho: 'Signing Luke Shaw would have killed Chelsea' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/26/jose-mourinho-chelsea-luke-shaw-wages |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 July 2014 |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw made his debut in the first match of the club's pre-season tour of the United States, playing the first 45 minutes of a 7–0 win over the [[LA Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Stone |title=Man Utd beat LA Galaxy: Louis van Gaal off to winning start |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28423344 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the start of the [[2014–15 Premier League|season]], he suffered a hamstring injury that ruled him out for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for a month with hamstring injury |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/13/luke-shaw-manchester-united-injured-hamstring |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Orr |title=Luke Shaw: Hamstring injury to £30m left-back could accelerate Manchester United moves for Marcos Rojo or Daley Blind |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/luke-shaw-hamstring-injury-to-30m-leftback-could-accelerate-manchester-united-moves-for-marcos-rojo-or-daley-blind-9667250.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was named as a substitute for Manchester United for the first time on 14 September 2014 in their fourth league match, and was unused as they recorded their first victory of the season against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henson |first=Mike |title=Man Utd 4–0 QPR |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29098240 |accessdate=27 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After again being an unused substitute in the subsequent defeat to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], Shaw made his competitive debut for United on 27 September 2014, playing the entirety of a 2–1 home victory against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanghera |first=Mandeep |title=Man Utd 2–1 West Ham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289922 |accessdate=27 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–present====
Shaw started every league match in the early [[2015–16 Manchester United F.C. season|2015–16 season]] until 15 September 2015, when, during the opening match of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], Shaw was caught by [[Héctor Moreno]] with a sliding tackle and suffered a double leg fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34264202 |title=Luke Shaw: Manchester United man suffers double leg fracture |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw was given oxygen and treated by nine medical staff during the nine-minute stoppage in [[Eindhoven]] before he was taken off on a stretcher and taken to hospital.

==International career==
Shaw's first experience of international football came in 2011, when he made six appearances for the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16 team]].&lt;ref name=englandprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/S/Luke-Shaw |title=Luke Shaw |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in February, before competing in the [[Montaigu Tournament]] in April and scoring his first international goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] at the tournament.&lt;ref name=englandprofile/&gt; He later made his debut for the [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 team]] in August against [[Italy national under-17 football team|Italy]], and played in eight matches in a seven-month stint with the national team.&lt;ref name=englandprofile/&gt;

'''Luis Antonio Valencia Mosquera''', known as '''Antonio Valencia''' ({{IPA-es|anˈtonjo βaˈlensja}};{{efn-ua|In isolation, ''Valencia'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|baˈlensja|}}.}} born 4 August 1985), is an Ecuadorian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] both English {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador national team]]. Primarily a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]], he had previously played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]] for a large duration of his career.

After progressing through the youth system at [[C.D. El Nacional|El Nacional]], Valencia became a first team regular and made over 80 appearances for the club. He won the [[Ecuadorian Serie A]] with them before signing for [[La Liga]] side [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in 2005. He only made two league appearances for the Spanish side in between loan spells at [[Recreativo de Huelva|Recreativo]] for the [[2005–06 Segunda División|2005–06 season]] and later English Premier League club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] from 2006 to 2008. Wigan Athletic later signed Valencia on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee in January 2008. His performances for Wigan Athletic soon attracted attention from several high-profile clubs, eventually signing for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in June 2009. Valencia has since won two Premier League titles, an [[FA Cup]], two [[EFL Cup|League Cups]], the [[UEFA Europa League]] and three [[FA Community Shield]]s. Valencia was voted into the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in his [[PFA Team of the Year#Premier League 18|debut season]] with the club.

Valencia made his Ecuador debut in 2004 and has represented his country at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2007 Copa América]], the [[2011 Copa América]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Copa América Centenario]]. Since making his debut, Valencia has won over 90 caps and scored 11 goals for his country.

==Early life==
Valencia was born on 4 August 1985 in Lago Agrio, near the city of [[Nueva Loja]], [[Ecuador]], which is located in the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref name="TenThings"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adrian |last=Millerick |title=Antonio Valencia profile: 10 things you need to know about the Manchester United target |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Antonio-Valencia-profile-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-Manchester-United-target-article31890.html |work=Mirrorfootball.co.uk |publisher=Mirror Football |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valencia helped his mother sell drinks outside the stadium of his local club at Lago Agrio and would then search for empty bottles for his father to sell to a bottle-deposit in the capital, [[Quito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Tanner |title=LUIS ANTONIO VALENCIA HAS THE BOTTLE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/160739/Luis-Antonio-Valencia-has-the-bottle-for-Manchester-United |work=Express.co.uk |publisher=Home of the Daily and Sunday Express |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valencia used to play barefoot on the pitch next to the bungalow he shared with his parents, five brothers and sister.&lt;ref name="£20m"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Wheeler |title=Valencia, the £20m boy from Ecuador's army, is now on the march with Wigan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1128483/Valencia-20m-boy-Ecuadors-army-march-Wigan.html |work=DailyMail.co.uk |publisher=Mail Online |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2009 | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20090129222710/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1128483/Valencia-20m-boy-Ecuadors-army-march-Wigan.html| archivedate= 29 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Valencia was aged 11, scout Pedro "Papi" Perlaza spotted him playing on a dusty field near his home, and signed him to the local FA-run sports academy in [[Sucumbíos Province|Sucumbíos]].&lt;ref name="Backstreets"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Lyttleton |title=Antonio Valencia: The boy from the backstreets of Ecuador who Manchester United want to be the new Ronaldo |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1205185/Antonio-Valencia-The-boy-backstreets-Ecuador-Manchester-United-want-new-Ronaldo.html |work=DailyMail.co.uk |publisher=Mail Online |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Valencia did not tell his father he left home to take up an offer to play for [[C.D.

In Benfica's second-leg [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Round of 32|Round of 32]] Europa League clash with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], Matić headed in a late goal after a cross from [[Lima (footballer)|Lima]] to seal a 3–1 aggregate victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000357/match=2010056/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Stylish Benfica put an end to Leverkusen |publisher=UEFA |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matić was an integral member throughout the [[2012–13 Primeira Liga]] campaign as Benfica looked to claim the club's first league championship since [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|2010]].

Matić was given a straight red card in Chelsea's 1–1 home draw against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 21 February 2015, for pushing over [[Ashley Barnes]] following a high tackle by him, which resulted in the bending of Matić's shin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Chelsea 1–1 Burnley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31466726|accessdate=22 February 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, his suspension was shortened to two matches, including the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nemanja Matic: Chelsea player's ban reduced to two games|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31613184|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the majority of the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season, Matić played as a central midfielder in a 3–4–3 formation.

==International career==
Matić's debut for the [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia under-21 team]] came in a match against [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark]] on 11 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round=15085/match=304060/report=lu.html | title = UEFA stats for Denmark U21 vs. Serbia U21 game | accessdate = | date = | publisher = | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three matches and two goals for the Serbia under-21 squad, he was called up to the [[Serbia national football team|Serbian senior squad]] and made his debut in a friendly against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 14 December 2008, in a 1–0 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.profutbal.sk/clanok67269.htm | title = Matić debutoval v srbskom drese | accessdate = | date = 14 December 2008 | publisher = ''profutbal'' | language = Slovak | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314093302/http://www.profutbal.sk/clanok67269.htm | archivedate = 14 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matić took part in the 2009 UEFA Euro Under-21 Championship, where he played 85 minutes in the first group match against [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]] in a 0–0 draw. Matić, however, injured himself after contact with Italian forward [[Sebastian Giovinco]]. He broke the fifth metatarsal in his right foot and was forced to undergo surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=1/newsid=838973.html |title=Broken bone robs Serbia of Matić |accessdate=6 July 2009 |date=17 June 2009 |publisher=''[[UEFA]]'' |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620083943/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=1/newsid=838973.html |archivedate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Matić announced he would not play for the Serbian national team while [[Siniša Mihajlović]] was the coach.

A left-footed [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], Matić's poise and power, in addition to his in-game intelligence and tactical awareness, have enabled his attacking teammates to flourish. He is often used at a holding position and screens the defence while providing cover for attacking movements. Just before he joined Manchester United, he had a tackle success rate of 75% in 123 Premier League appearances, a higher rate than [[N'Golo Kante]], [[Ander Herrera]], [[Fernandinho (footballer)|Fernandinho]] and [[Jordan Henderson]].&lt;ref name="Bibby"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Bibby, Stephen |date=31 July 2017 |title=Seven quick facts about Nemanja Matic |trans-title= |medium= |language=English |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/New-Signings-201718/New-Signings-201718-News/2017/Jul/video-seven-facts-on-new-manchester-united-signing-nemanja-matic.aspx |access-date=30 October 2017 |format= |time= |location= |publisher=Manchester United |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Mourinho]] commented on Matić, "At this moment, he is a giant, not for his size but for the way he plays."&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; Matić's qualities have led to comparison to his ex-teammate at Manchester United, [[Michael Carrick]].&lt;ref name="Higgins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Exclusive-Interviews/2017/Aug/Former-Manchester-United-captain-Nemanja-Vidic-discusses-fellow-Serbian-Nemanja-Matic.aspx |title=Nemanja on Nemanja: Vidic discusses Matic |last=Higgins |first=Adam |date=28 August 2017 |website=Official Manchester United Website |publisher=Manchester United |access-date=30 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Although he started his career as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]], and has occasionally continued to be used in this role, and even played as a central or defensive midfielder for the Milan youth team, in recent years Darmian has predominantly played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|wing-back]], or even as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] on occasion; due to his ability with both feet, he is capable of playing on either flank, although he prefers to be deployed on the right side of the pitch. An intelligent, dynamic, hard-working, and versatile player, he is known for his good quality of offensive and defensive play, as well as his tactical awareness, pace, and stamina, attributes which allow him to cover the wing effectively and provide width to his team when attacking; his professionalism, as well as his promising and consistent performances in his youth, led him to be compared to several esteemed Italian former full-backs, such as [[Antonio Cabrini]] and [[Paolo Maldini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttocalcionews.net/2014/06/17/speciale-giovani-talenti-matteo-darmian-il-nuovo-cabrini/|title=Speciale giovani talenti: Matteo Darmian, il nuovo Cabrini|publisher=Tutto Calcio News|language=Italian|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720155800/http://www.tuttocalcionews.net/2014/06/17/speciale-giovani-talenti-matteo-darmian-il-nuovo-cabrini/|archivedate=20 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2094412-matteo-darmian-can-be-italys-secret-weapon-by-following-in-cabrinis-footsteps|title=Matteo Darmian Can Be Italy's Secret Weapon by Following in Cabrini's Footsteps|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescore.ie/analysis-england-italy-saturday-won-and-lost-1520218-Jun2014/|title=Here’s where England v Italy was won and lost|publisher=The Score|accessdate=16 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622163027/http://www.thescore.ie/analysis-england-italy-saturday-won-and-lost-1520218-Jun2014/|archivedate=22 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Losing Mattia De Sciglio Isn't a Major Problem for Italy and Prandelli|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2095900-why-losing-mattia-de-sciglio-isnt-a-major-problem-for-italy-and-prandelli|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=style&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttopalermo.net/?action=read&amp;idnotizia=32338|title=Palermo, Darmian piacevole sorpresa|work=tuttopalermo.net|author= Giovanni Chinnici|language=Italian|date=3 February 2011|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/50656/darmian-provides-italy-hope|title=Darmian provides Italy hope|publisher=Football Italia|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Italy’s World Cup 23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/49953/italy%E2%80%99s-world-cup-23|title=Italy’s World Cup 23|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Luca Persico|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dear Matteo Darmian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/85318/dear-matteo-darmian|title=Dear Matteo Darmian|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Andrea Tallarita|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9905854/arda-turan-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-reported-manchester-united-and-liverpool-target|title=Who is Manchester United's new signing Matteo Darmian?|publisher=Sky Sports|date=12 July 2015|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/15/italy-hail-the-new-special-one-antonio-conte/|title=Italy hail the new 'special one' Antonio Conte|publisher=The Telegraph|author1=James Ducker|date=15 June 2016|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-mnu-darmian/modern-fullback-needs-technique-pace-and-smarts-says-darmian-idUKKBN13W0ZP |title=Modern fullback needs technique, pace and smarts, says Darmian |publisher=Reuters |date=7 December 2016 |accessdate=20 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2012–13 Serie A|2012–13]] season, Darmian made the most tackles per game (5.3) across Europe's top five leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Articles/-gjpj1fo10qyu-oezf2gca|title=Player Focus: Torino's Matteo Darmian is Europe's best tackler|work=whoscored.com|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
====Youth career====
McTominay was associated with the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United academy]] from the age of five after attending the club's development centre in Preston.&lt;ref name="ManUtd"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Who is Scott McTominay? |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2017/Apr/who-is-scott-mctominay-inside-united-youth-focus.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=30 April 2017 |access-date=30 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having played as a centre forward in the earlier years of his youth career, McTominay converted to a central midfield role under [[Warren Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Scott McTominay |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Scott-McTominay.aspx |website=ManUtd.com |access-date=30 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201075310/http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Scott-McTominay.aspx |archive-date=2017-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed his first professional contract in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Joe|last=Short|title=Who is Scott McTominay?

He made seven appearances for the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-18s]] between 2013 and 2015, but struggled due to his small size.&lt;ref name="youthhawk"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Scott McTominay |url=http://youthhawk.co.uk/wiki/Scott_McTominay |website=youthhawk.co.uk |access-date=30 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812173849/http://youthhawk.co.uk/wiki/Scott_McTominay |archive-date=2017-08-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McTominay missed most of the 2014–15 season due to injuries relating to growth and development issues, growing 14 inches within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Samuel |last=Luckhurst |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-scott-mctominay-wiki-12965015|title=Who is Scott McTominay? Manchester United midfielder profile |work=Manchester Evening News |date=30 April 2017 |access-date=30 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTominay struggled again during the 2015–16 season, making 11 appearances across the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-19s]] and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-21s]], but commanded a place in the team the following season with three goals in 21 games prior to his senior call-up.&lt;ref name="youthhawk"/&gt;

====2016–17 season====
On 30 April 2017, McTominay was named on the substitutes' bench for a match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in the [[Premier League]]. He made his first Premier League appearance on 7 May, coming on as a substitute against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Stephan |last=Shemilt |title=Manchester United 1–1 Swansea City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39682899 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=28 April 2017 |access-date=30 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before starting Manchester United's final Premier League match of the season on 21 May, a 2–0 win at home to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shamoon |last=Hafez |title=Manchester United 2–0 Crystal Palace |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39912026 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2017 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
McTominay was born in England but has Scottish ancestry through his father coming from [[Helensburgh]].&lt;ref name=helens&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.scot/sport/17507147.alex-mcleish-scott-mctominay-can-be-a-scotland-great-but-fans-shouldnt-expect-george-best/ |title=Alex McLeish: Scott McTominay can be a Scotland great - but fans shouldn't expect George Best |work=The National |publiher= |date=18 March 2019 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McTominay attended training camps with the Scottish youth sides. In November 2017, McTominay told [[Scottish Football Association]] performance director [[Malky Mackay]] that he wanted to concentrate on securing a place in the Manchester United first-team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41890205 |title=Scotland: Scott McTominay yet to decide on his international future |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=6 November 2017 |accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Speaking in February 2018, club manager [[José Mourinho]] suggested that new Scotland manager [[Alex McLeish]] should select McTominay "because it looks like England is missing him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43105205 |title=Manchester United's Jose Mourinho says Scott McTominay deserves Scotland call |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=18 February 2018 |accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McTominay pledged his future to Scotland and was selected in their squad for two friendlies in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43279384|title=Scott McTominay: Man Utd midfielder pledges international future to Scotland|date=4 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43369364 |title=Six new faces in Alex McLeish's Scotland squad for March friendlies |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 March 2018 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, McTominay's grandfather revealed [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] wanted him to represent Scotland. Manchester United academy coach [[Brian McClair]] explained "McLeish made a huge effort getting to [[Trafford Training Centre|Carrington]] to meet up with him, because it was in the middle of the bad weather that we had. He made it, put a case. [[Gareth Southgate]] sent him a text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/scotland/580/blog/post/3427665/scott-mctominay-choosing-scotland-over-england-was-a-no-brainer|title=Choosing Scotland easy for McTominay|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
