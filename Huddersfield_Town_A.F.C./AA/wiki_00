Jonas Lössl

Jonas Bybjerg Lössl (born 1 February 1989) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Huddersfield Town.

A grandparent of Jonas Lössl is German. For this reason, his surname is written with "ö" instead of "ø" which is otherwise the normal spelling of this letter in the Danish language.

A product of the FC Midtjylland football academy, Lössl made his Danish Superliga debut with FC Midtjylland in March 2010. He played a total number of 137 matches for the club.

On 5 June 2014, FC Midtjylland reported that they had sold Lössl to French football club, Guingamp. After initially starting his first season as a backup keeper at the club, Lössl eventually established himself as the club's first-choice keeper in his two seasons at the club.

On 16 June 2016, it was reported that Lössl was making a move to German club Mainz 05. The club cited that they intended Lössl to be the instant replacement for the club's previous keeper, Loris Karius, who himself had just transferred to Liverpool.

After one season at Mainz, Lössl signed for Huddersfield Town on a season-loan on 30 June 2017. On 12 August 2017, Lössl made his debut for Huddersfield in a 3–0 win against Crystal Palace.

Following a successful loan spell in which he kept 10 Premier League clean sheets, Huddersfield activated a clause in Lössl's loan deal from Mainz, and signed him permanently for an undisclosed fee.

Lössl played 22 games for various Danish national youth teams, including 15 games for the Denmark under-21 national football team.

He was called up to the senior Denmark squad in June 2015 for a friendly against Montenegro, and again for the UEFA Euro 2016 play-off against Sweden in November 2015.

He made his senior debut coming on as a subsistute for Kasper Schmeichel against Scotland in 2016.

In May 2018 Lössl was named in Denmark's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Terence Kongolo

Terence Kongolo (born 14 February 1994) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Huddersfield Town. Kongolo made his Eredivisie debut for Feyenoord during the 2011–12 season. Born in Switzerland to Congolese parents, Kongolo was raised in the Netherlands and represents the Netherlands national football team.

Kongolo joined Feyenoord as an 8-year old. After progressing through the ranks of under-16 and under-17 side, Kongolo then signed his first professional contract with the side in June 2010. A year later, he was promoted to the first team ahead of the 2011–12 season and appeared on the substitute bench, around the same time playing for the reserve side. It wasn't until on 14 April 2012 when he made his debut under manager Ronald Koeman, where he came on as a substitute, in 3–0 win over Excelsior. This turned out to be his only appearance of the season and at the end of the 2011–12 season, he signed a contract extension, keeping him until June 2015.

In the 2012–13 season, Kongolo then made his first league start on 24 August 2012 against Heracles Almelo following the injury of Stefan de Vrij and the suspension of both Joris Mathijsen and Bruno Martins Indi, where he played the whole game, in a 2–1 win. The following month, on 26 September 2012, he scored his first Feyenoord goal in the second round of the KNVB Cup, in a 3–2 win over NEC and scored again in the third round of KNVB Cup, in a 4–0 win over XerxesDZB on 1 November 2012. However, Kongolo received a red card after a second bookable, just 13 minutes after receiving a yellow card, in a 2–2 draw against Groningen on 7 October 2012. As the 2012–13 season, Kongolo suffered a knee injury that kept him out for the most of the season and upon returning from injury, he played in the reserve for the rest of the season, scoring once against PSV Eindhoven U21 on 2 April 2013. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Kongolo went on to make five appearance for the first team side.

At the start of the 2013–14 season, Kongolo didn't feature in the first team, as he spent the start of the season, on the reserve side. At the reserve side, he appeared nine times and captained the side on five occasions. It also saw Kongolo switch his shirt number from twenty-five to fifteen. His first appearance came on 29 September 2013 against ADO Den Haag, coming on as a second half substitute, which saw them win 4–2. After continuously appearing in the reserve side and making two more league appearance by the end of the 2013, Kongolo was then given a handful of first team appearances as a centre-back for the rest of the season, dispatching from Joris Mathijsen. Despite suffering a minor hip injury against Go Ahead Eagles on 30 March 2014, Kongolo finished the 2013–14 season, making eighteen appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2014–15 season, Kongolo's performance in the World Cup, despite playing once, attracted interests from clubs around Europe, but the club management remained confident of keeping him. On 28 July 2014, it was announced that Kongolo signed a three-year contract with the club, keeping him until 2017 and ending his transfer speculation. After appearing the first two league matches of the season, Kongolo was demoted to the substitute bench for two matches after losing his left-back position to youngster Miquel Nelom. Kongolo returned to the first team soon after when he started against Willem II, which they lost 2–1. From that moment on, Kongolo regained his first team place, mostly playing in the centre-back position, partnering with Sven van Beek, for the most of the season. Kongolo then set up one of the two goals, in a 2–0 win over PEC Zwolle on 1 November 2014. Despite suffering from a groin injury, Kongolo finished the 2014–15 season, making forty-five appearances in all competitions.

In the 2015–16 season, Kongolo switched number shirt again when he switched from number five to four this time following the retirement of Joris Mathijsen from club football. Kongolo established himself in the first team as the left-back position and started the season well when he set up one of the goals, in a 2–0 win over Vitesse on 23 September 2015. Since the start of the season, Kongolo was ever-present in the first team until he was suspended for one game for picking his fourth booking this season. After returning to the first team from suspension, Kongolo then signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2018. However, as the 2015–16 season progressed, Kongolo suffered a hamstring injury during the match against Vitesse and was substituted as a result. After the match, it was announced that Kongolo would be out between four and six weeks. After returning to the first team, Kongolo started in the final of the KNVB Cup against Utrecht and although he was booked, leading to Ramon Leeuwin scoring an equaliser, Kongolo helped the side win the KNVB Cup with two goals to one. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Kongolo went on to make thirty-five appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Kongolo's performance began to attract interests from European clubs, such as, Sunderland, Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen but stayed at the club throughout the summer. Kongolo continued to be a first team regular since the start of the 2016–17 season and was involved in the squad that saw Feyenoord make an impressive start, with 12 wins in the row. During their winning streak, he scored his first professional for the side, in a 5–0 win over Roda on 25 September 2016. Elsewhere in the UEFA Europa League, Kongolo helped Feyenoord keep two clean sheets against Manchester United and Zorya Luhansk, which saw him named as UEFA Team of the Week on Matchday 1 and Matchday 3. However, Kongolo suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out throughout November. After returning to the first team, Kongolo captained the club the first time in his professional career in the quarter-final of the KNVB Cup against Vitesse, which saw them lose 2–0. On 26 February 2017, Kongolo set up one of the goals, in a 2–1 win over PSV Eindhoven to continue their winning form. However, in a 1–0 loss against Sparta Rotterdam, on 5 March 2017, Kongolo suffered a thigh injury in the first half and was substituted as result. After weeks on the sidelined, Kongolo managed to return to training, but continued to remain on the sidelined throughout March. It wasn't until on 16 April 2017 when he returned to the first team from injury against Utrecht and setting up a goal for Eljero Elia, in a 2–0 win. Shortly after, he signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2019. Kongolo played the remaining last four matches as a left-back later in the season and helped the club win the league for the first time since 1999. At the end of the 2016–17 season, he went on to make thirty-two appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

On 3 July 2017, Kongolo transferred to AS Monaco, signing a five-year contract.

On 2 January 2018, Huddersfield Town announced the signing of Kongolo on loan until the end of the 2017–18 season.

On 8 June 2018, Huddersfield Town completed the permanent signing of Kongolo for an undisclosed club record fee.

During the final of the Under-17 Championship against Germany U17, he scored against them for the second time in his Netherlands U17 career, which saw Netherlands U17 win 5–2. He was also named to the Team of the Tournament. The following month, Kongolo was called up again for the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Mexico, but was unable to progress in the Group-Stage.

After playing Netherlands U18 briefly around 2012, Kongolo was called up by Netherlands U19 in August 2012 and made his Netherlands U19 debut on 10 September 2012, in a 2–1 win over Scotland U19.

Kongolo's performances for Feyenoord saw him included senior team manager Louis Van Gaal's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It wasn't until on 17 May 2014 when he made his senior national team debut, in a 1–1 draw against Ecuador. After the match, both van Gaal and Kongolo agreed that his performance was sloppy.

Nevertheless, Kongolo was included in the twenty-three man squad in the tournament, where he made one appearance in their final group game after entering as a substitute for Dirk Kuyt in the 89th minute against Chile; the Dutch won 2–0. Although making one appearance in the tournament, Netherlands finished third place in the World Cup and for that, he received a bronze medal.

On 1 August 2011, Hamer joined Charlton Athletic on a three-year contract and was immediately handed the number one jersey. He made his debut on 23 August 2011 against his former club Reading in the League Cup first round and helped Charlton to a 2 – 1 win. After some initial nervous performances he cemented his place in the team, making crucial saves throughout Charlton's title winning League One campaign. He clinched promotion to the Championship with Chris Powell's side in April 2012, with a 1 – 0 win over Carlisle United and continued to play regularly for the Addicks during the 2012–13 season. A series of injuries resulted in hamer playing fewer matches in the 2013–14 season.

After several weeks of strong speculation about Hamer's move to Leicester City, it was finally confirmed on 22 May 2014, by Hamer himself on social media. Hamer says he made the move to the newly promoted Foxes for the chance to play Premier League football. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at home to Shrewsbury Town in a Capital One Cup second round tie. Following an injury to Kasper Schmeichel whilst on international duty, Hamer made his Premier League debut on 13 September, putting in a very good performance and keeping a clean sheet as Leicester secured a 1–0 win at Stoke City, their first victory since returning to the Premier League.

He played his second game for Leicester against Premier League champions, Manchester City in a 0–1 home defeat on 13 December. After playing 7 games for Leicester, Hamer lost his place when on 6 January 2015, Leicester signed experienced goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea to help cover for the injured Kasper Schmeichel. In the 2016–17 season, Hamer started Leicester's sixth Champions League group game, giving him his Champions League debut. Leicester lost 5–0 to FC Porto.

On 25 July 2015, Hamer joined Championship side Nottingham Forest on a season-long loan deal. However, he returned to Leicester on 4 August after the loan was cut short due to Nottingham Forest's financial issues.

On 11 August 2015, Hamer joined Championship side Bristol City on season-long loan deal. However, he returned to Leicester City on 17 November 2015 after making only five appearances for the club.

Laurent Depoitre

Laurent Depoitre (born 7 December 1988) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Huddersfield Town and the Belgium national team.

When a large number of players had to leave Péruwelz after the 2008–09 season, Eendracht Aalst took advantage of the situation in the summer of 2009 and signed Depoitre alongside Damien Galucci and Olivier De Castro. Depoitre formed a good pair in Alost with Wouter Moreels, and he was chosen as the best player of the team after his first season. 2011, the team became champion in Third Division A. In the 2011–12 season Depoitre was followed by, among other clubs, AA Gent, Lierse SK, Oud-Heverlee Leuven, Beerschot AC, N.E.C., Heerenveen, Willem II and Roda JC.

In 2012, Depoitre joined Oostende from Aalst.

In January 2013, it was announced that he would be transferred to Zulte Waregem in 2013–14. Afterwards, his transfer turned out to be a part of a share transaction between Yves Lejaeghere, the then-president of Ostend, and Patrick Decuyper, the then-general manager of Zulte Waregem. In the end the transaction was cancelled and as a result the transfer was also revoked.

After Depoitre decided not to extend his contract with Oostende, it was announced that he would play for KAA Gent during the 2014–2015 season.

On 8 August 2016, Depoitre signed for Portuguese club Porto for four seasons, with €40 million release fee. Porto paid a €6 million transfer fee to Gent. He finished the season with 13 appearances across all competitions scoring two goals and providing one assist.

On 23 June 2017, it was confirmed that Depoitre had signed a two-year contract with Premier League newcomers Huddersfield Town, for an undisclosed fee, and a record transfer fee for the club. However, his transfer fee record would go on to be overtaken later that transfer window, by Aaron Mooy moving from Manchester City for £8 million.

On 10 October 2015, he made his senior debut for the national team in a 4–1 win in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualification match against Andorra. Depoitre scored his team's fourth goal.

Alex Pritchard

Alex David Pritchard (born 3 May 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club Huddersfield Town. He has represented England at U20 and U21 level.

Pritchard began his career in the academy at West Ham United, before transferring to the youth setup at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in June 2009. Pritchard quickly established himself in the U18 team. He received his maiden call into the first team squad for a UEFA Europa League group stage game versus PAOK on 15 September 2011. Awarded the number 54 shirt, he remained on the bench for the 0–0 draw. He was called up for another Europa League group match versus Rubin Kazan on 3 November, again remaining on the bench. Pritchard made an impact in the 2011–12 NextGen Series, where he ended up top-scorer for Spurs with four goals, three of which came against the eventual winners Inter Milan. Pritchard courted transfer interest from Premier League side Queens Park Rangers in April 2012. Pritchard added another four goals in the 2012–13 edition of the NextGen Series, one of which came in a particularly notable 4–1 away victory against Barcelona, bringing his tally to eight goals in 11 NextGen Series appearances. Following Pritchard's NextGen Series performances and with only half a year remaining on his contract, there was speculation that Spanish sides Real Madrid and Barcelona would attempt to sign him. Liverpool (with Pritchard's former Tottenham U18 manager Alex Inglethorpe on their staff) were also reported to be interested, but Pritchard ended the speculation when he signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal with Spurs on 31 January 2013. Pritchard also appeared for Tottenham's U21 team during the 2012–13 season, scoring five goals in 11 appearances to help the U21s to the U21 Premier League knockout stage final against Manchester United. Pritchard scored Tottenham's second goal and was substituted after 64 minutes for Kenny McEvoy in the 3–2 defeat.

After spending the majority of the 2013–14 season out on loan, Pritchard received his first call into the first team squad in two-and-a-half years when he was named as a substitute for a Premier League match versus his former side West Ham United on 3 May 2014. Allotted the number 39 shirt, he remained on the bench for the 2–0 defeat. Pritchard was called up again for the final game of the season against Aston Villa and made his debut for the club when he replaced Gylfi Sigurðsson after 83 minutes of the 3–0 win. After the match, he said "it was good to get my Spurs debut under my belt and to play alongside top quality players. It was a great way to finish the season and hopefully next year I can push on again and get even more game time". On 21 August 2015, Pritchard agreed to a new four-year contract with Tottenham.

On 31 January 2013, Pritchard signed on loan with Championship side Peterborough United until the end of the 2012–13 season. He had scored four goals for the Tottenham Development Squad in an 8–1 victory over Peterborough on 15 January. Awarded the number 33 shirt, Pritchard was named on the bench for a league match versus Burnley two days later. He made his professional debut when he replaced Nathaniel Knight-Percival after 55 minutes of the 1–0 defeat. He came on again as a substitute in the following game against Leicester City, but lasted just 16 minutes before suffering torn ligaments in his ankle. Pritchard returned to Tottenham Hotspur for treatment and didn't appear again for the Posh until a late cameo in a 3–2 victory over Watford on 13 April. He made just six appearances for the club before returning to White Hart Lane at the end of the season.

On 9 July 2013, Pritchard joined League One side Swindon Town on a season long loan deal, linking up with fellow Tottenham loanees Massimo Luongo, Grant Hall, Ryan Mason and former teammates Nathan Byrne and Jack Barthram at the County Ground. Wearing the number 11 shirt, Pritchard scored his first goal for the club on 27 August, in a 2–0 win against Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup second round. Pritchard's form led to interest from Championship sides Huddersfield Town, Blackburn Rovers and League One leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2013. Pritchard was sent off for the first time in his career in a league match versus Bristol City on 15 March, receiving a straight red card for a shove on Wade Elliott. Earlier in the season, manager Mark Cooper stated that Pritchard would need to "curb his temper", after he picked up five bookings in seven league matches. Pritchard won rave reviews for his performances during the season, receiving nominations for the League One Player of the Year and Football League Young Player of the Year awards. Of the nominations, he said "I'm absolutely chuffed to be nominated, I've worked hard all season and with the amount of players of my age doing so well, it's great to get that recognition". Pritchard was a key player for Swindon over the course of the 2013–14 season, making 44 appearances and scoring eight goals. Looking back on his time with the Robins, Pritchard said "it was great for me to be playing first team football at Swindon this season, I needed to get out and play competitively and I loved every minute of it".

After transfer interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic, Pritchard signed for Championship side Brentford on a season-long loan on 17 July 2014. Manager Mark Warburton (who helped create the now-defunct NextGen Series) said Pritchard "is very good tactically and technically with excellent dead ball delivery. He showed his quality while he was on loan at Swindon last year. Alex will add to the quality in our squad". Pritchard scored two goals in a 3–2 pre-season friendly victory over Nice at Griffin Park on 26 July. He made his competitive debut for the club on the opening day of the 2014–15 season, lasting 79 minutes of a 1–1 draw with Charlton Athletic before being replaced by Tommy Smith. Pritchard scored his first competitive goal for the Bees with the equaliser in a 2–1 victory over Blackpool on 19 August. He scored his second goal a 3–1 win over Reading on 4 October, slotting the ball through Adam Federici's legs after Andre Gray had slipped. On 24 January 2015, Pritchard's performance and winning penalty in a 2–1 win over Norwich City earned him a place in the Football League Team of the Week. Another good performance and a goal in a 3–1 victory over Bournemouth in late February saw him named in the Football League Team of the Week for the second time of the season. Pritchard went on a run of four goals in seven games in March and April, but his season ended in disappointment with defeat to Middlesbrough in the playoff semi-finals. He made 47 appearances and scored 12 goals. Pritchard won much recognition for his performances during the 2014–15 season, winning a place in the Championship PFA Team of the Year, the Brentford Players' and Social Media Player of the Year awards, a nomination for the London Football Awards Young Player of the Year award and separate awards for Player of the Year from the Irish and Italian Brentford supporters' clubs. He was named eighth best Championship player at the 2015 Football League Awards and one of the top 20 players in the Football League and 'FL Wonderkid' by "FourFourTwo" and "Match" respectively.

On 1 February 2016, Pritchard signed for West Brom on loan. He made his debut in the 1–0 loss to Newcastle United.

On 4 August 2016, Pritchard joined Championship club Norwich City on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee. However some news agencies such as "The Mirror" have reported the fee as being £8,000,000. Pritchard scored his first goal for Norwich in an EFL Cup tie against Leeds United on 25 October 2016. Pritchard scored the final goal in a 5–0 victory over one of his old loan clubs, Brentford, on 3 December 2016.

In the 2017–18 season, Pritchard made nine appearances for Norwich in all competitions, scoring once, after returning from a knee injury that had sidelined him at the start of the season.

On 12 January 2018, Pritchard joined Premier League club Huddersfield Town for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-and-a-half year contract with the Yorkshire club, later estimated to amount to 11M. His debut versus West Ham United ended in a 4–1 home defeat. On 11 February, he scored his first Premier League goal in a 4–1 home win over Bournemouth, while also winning a penalty.

On 27 May 2013, Pritchard was named in manager Peter Taylor's 21-man squad for the 2013 U20 World Cup. He made his debut on 16 June, in a 3–0 pre-tournament friendly win over Uruguay. He made two appearances in the group stage of the U20 World Cup, against Chile and Egypt. Pritchard received his first call into the U21 squad on 28 August 2014 and made his debut in a 1–0 2015 European U21 Championship qualifying victory over Lithuania on 5 September, coming on for Nathan Redmond after 79 minutes. Pritchard made his first U21 start on his fourth cap, starting in a friendly versus France on 17 November. He was replaced by Danny Ings at half time during the 3–2 defeat. In mid-December, Pritchard received a 2014 England U21 Player of the Year award nomination.

Pritchard was born in the village of Orsett, and grew up in Thurrock, Essex. He attended Belhus Chase Specialist Humanities College in Aveley prior to signing for West Ham United.

Mathias Jørgensen

Mathias Jattah-Njie Jørgensen (; born 23 April 1990), commonly known as Zanka, is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a centre back for the club Huddersfield Town and the Denmark national team.

He began his career at boyhood club FC Copenhagen, playing regularly in five Superliga seasons, before a move to PSV Eindhoven in 2012, where he spent two seasons in the Eredivisie before returning to Denmark after finding his chances limited. He joined Huddersfield Town in July 2017 for a fee of £3.5 million.

Formerly an international at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-21 level, Jørgensen made his senior international debut for Denmark aged 18 in November 2008.

Born to a Danish mother and a Gambian father, Jørgensen moved to FC Copenhagen from neighbouring club B.93, where he had played in first-team matches even at the young age of 16. He signed a three-year contract with FCK on 26 June 2007. Before signing with the Danish champions, he had visited Arsenal for a one-week trial.

On 21 July 2007, Jørgensen strained the inner ligament in the left knee in a reserve team match – less than a month after he moved to the club. On 9 September, he played again for the reserve team. His first team debut came on 26 September 2007 in a cup match against FC Fredericia. He substituted Oscar Wendt 5 minutes before full-time, in the match FCK won 3–1. Three days later he got his Superliga debut, this time replacing Hjalte Nørregaard about 15 minutes before full-time.

Only 8 days after his first team debut, Jørgensen was thrown on pitch in the extra time of the UEFA Cup first round second leg at Parken Stadium against RC Lens, after captain Michael Gravgaard had received a red card. He was substituted for Marcus Allbäck and played in the central defence together with Brede Hangeland, and they prevented any more goals for Lens, when they were 10 against 11.

On 19 November 2008, he made his debut for the Danish national football team in a friendly against Wales.

After Roland Nilsson became manager for Copenhagen he became captain for "The Lions". 22 February 2012 it was announced that Jørgensen would join Dutch club PSV Eindhoven on a free transfer during the summer transfer window.

Jørgensen was featured in an unofficial pre-season tournament, The Polish Masters, in July 2012 and scored his first goal for PSV in their game against S.L. Benfica on 22 July. However, he struggled to break into PSV's first XI and only played 14 matches for the club over the course of two years.

On 7 July 2014, Jørgensen returned to his former team FC Copenhagen for a fee of around 600,000 Euros.

On 7 July 2017, Huddersfield Town confirmed the signing of Jørgensen from FC Copenhagen for £3.5 million on a three-year contract.

In May 2018 he was named in Denmark's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Jørgensen dated with Hungarian model Enikő Mihalik.

Jørgensen received his nickname, "Zanka", from the movie Cool Runnings, in which the character played by Doug E. Doug is named Sanka. The nickname was coined by Johan Lange in 2000, while both Lange and Jørgensen were playing for B.93. Lange would go on to be one of the assistant managers during Jørgensen's first spell at FC Copenhagen, and he would later serve as the technical director when Jørgensen returned to the club in 2014.

Jason Puncheon

Jason David Ian Puncheon (born 18 June 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Huddersfield Town, on loan from Crystal Palace.

Following his goal against Everton on his Blackpool debut, he has scored in all of the top four divisions of English league football, scoring for Barnet in League Two, Milton Keynes Dons and Southampton in League One, Millwall in the Championship and Blackpool, Southampton and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

Born in Croydon, Greater London, Puncheon began his career with Wimbledon, and moved with the team to Milton Keynes, where the club became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. He was released in January 2006. He moved to Barnet in June of the same year, after brief spells with Fisher Athletic and Lewes. He was named FA Cup Player of the Third Round in 2007 and the following season after scoring a succession of brilliant goals (including a last minute 35-yard free kick versus Bradford) was named in the PFA Team of the Season.

Plymouth Argyle signed Puncheon from Barnet for £250,000 in 2008. He endured an unsuccessful 18-month spell at the club, making six league appearances. He was loaned to former club MK Dons three times in two years, where he scored 11 goals in 51 appearances.

On 30 January 2010, Puncheon joined Southampton which then led to his loan deal at MK Dons to be cut short. He scored his first goal in a 5–1 victory over Walsall, and scored again a few days later, in a 5–0 victory over Huddersfield.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, he was a regular in the first team. However, when Alan Pardew lost his job just days after a 4–0 win away to Bristol Rovers, Southampton hired Nigel Adkins as manager. Under Adkins, he stayed in the first team, but found himself under increasing pressure from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his place. Eventually Adkins lost patience with Puncheon's erratic performances, and dropped him to the bench in favour of 17-year-old Chamberlain, who was later sold to Arsenal for a reported £15m. On 16 November 2010, Puncheon moved on an emergency loan deal to Millwall. He scored his first goal on his first game for Millwall in their 1–0 victory over Middlesbrough. On 1 January 2011, Puncheon scored a hat-trick in the 3–0 victory over Crystal Palace.

On 31 January 2011, Puncheon joined Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut, scoring a goal, at Everton on 5 February. He scored his second goal against Chelsea on 7 March at Bloomfield Road. Puncheon re-joined the Saints after Blackpool's failed attempt to fight off relegation. On 31 August 2011, Puncheon joined Queens Park Rangers on loan until 2 January 2012.

He returned to the Saints after his unsuccessful loan spell at QPR, but on 21 January 2012, he publicly criticised Executive chairman Nicola Cortese. However just days later, it was revealed that Puncheon had apologised to Cortese and would be available for selection in the first team. He then started the next two matches: a 1–1 draw in the FA Cup at Millwall and a 1–1 draw in the Championship against Cardiff City.

He scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season with a 30-yard volley in a league cup win at Stevenage. He scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton in a 4–1 home victory against Aston Villa. His second came when Southampton won 3–1 away to Queens Park Rangers. He scored his third Premier League goal in the 61st minute against Reading to secure Southampton a vital 1–0 victory and move them out of the relegation zone. His fourth was scored to give Southampton a 2–2 draw away to the Champions of Europe Chelsea. On 9 February 2013, he scored his fifth in Southampton's 3–1 home win against 2011–12 champions Manchester City.

On 1 March 2013, Puncheon signed a new contract with Southampton, expiring in 2016.

On 21 August 2013, Puncheon signed a one-year loan with Crystal Palace. He missed a penalty as Palace lost 2–0 away to Tottenham Hotspur on 11 January 2014, but made up for his miss by scoring the only goal of their 1–0 win against Stoke City the following weekend. On 31 January 2014, Puncheon made his loan spell into a permanent move, for a fee of around £1.75m. Puncheon's three goals in January and a further three in back-to-back wins in April that lifted Palace away from the relegation zone, led boss Tony Pulis to issue a 'hands off' warning to other clubs interesting in signing Puncheon.

On 16 August 2014, in Palace's first match of the new season away to Arsenal, Puncheon took a corner which was headed in by Brede Hangeland for the first goal of the game. He was sent off for his second booking in the 89th minute, after which Arsenal scored their winning goal. On 17 January 2015, Puncheon scored his third goal of the season and second in as many games against Burnley in a 3–2 away win. Crystal Palace had come from 2 goals down to claim victory to boost their survival hopes. Palace manager Alan Pardew heaped praise on Puncheon's performance, describing him as "the best player on the pitch by a country mile." 

On 6 April 2015, Puncheon scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace against Manchester City. Puncheon's goal came from a freekick which went past Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart. He opened the scoring in the 2016 FA Cup Final against Manchester United with a goal in the 78th minute, but Palace went on to lose the match 2–1 after extra time.

On 18 July 2017, Puncheon replaced Scott Dann as captain. In January 2018, manager Roy Hodgson announced that Puncheon would play no further part in the 2017–18 season following a cruciate ligament injury sustained while playing against Manchester City.

On 4 January 2019, Puncheon signed for Premier League club Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season.

Puncheon is of Jamaican descent and is eligible for the Jamaica national football team.

In December 2017, Puncheon was arrested and charged with possession of an offensive weapon, common assault, and a public order offence of "causing fear or provocation of violence" after a fight outside a nightclub in Reigate. On 5 January 2018, Puncheon appeared in court where he denied the charge of assault. The charge of possessing an offensive weapon was withdrawn and he was bailed to appear again in court on 4 June. He later changed his plea to guilty and was given a community order requiring him to carry out 210 hours of unpaid work, and pay the doorman involved £250 compensation.

Ramadan Sobhi

Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed (; born 23 January 1997) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Al Ahly on loan from Huddersfield Town and the Egypt national team.

Sobhi began his career with leading Egyptian club Al Ahly, making his professional debut in February 2014. He established himself in the first team at the Cairo International Stadium and helped Al Ahly to win the Egyptian Premier League title in the 2013–14 and 2015–16 campaigns. His performances attracted the attentions of European clubs and in July 2016 he joined English side Stoke City for a fee of £5 million. He spent two seasons with Stoke before joining Huddersfield Town in June 2018. On 28 December 2018, it was announced that Ramadan Sobhi returned to Al Ahly on loan from Huddersfield for 6 months for a fee of £800,000 after failing to make appearances for The Terriers, with just 3 appearances out of the bench.

After progressing through the youth ranks at Cairo club Al Ahly, Sobhi made his professional debut at the age of 16 on 6 February 2014, in a 2013–14 Egyptian Premier League match against Ghazl El Mahalla under the management of Mohamed Youssef. In April 2014 he took part in the Sheikh Zayed friendly tournament in the UAE with Al Ahly-U17's, and attracted the attentions of Spanish club Atlético Madrid. On 16 June 2014, he scored his first goal for Al Ahly in a 3–0 win over Misr Lel-Makkasa. On 28 June 2014 he started the decisive championship play-off match against city rivals, Zamalek and helped his team to a 1–0 victory. On 2 July he scored twice against Petrojet to secure a 4–0 win and Al Ahly went on to claim the league title. In March 2015, Sobhi signed a long-term contract with Al Ahly.

Sobhi helped Al Ahly win the 2014 Egyptian Super Cup against Zamalek. He became a regular under Juan Garrido and his performances in 2014–15 attracted the attentions of European clubs, including Arsenal, RB Leipzig, Roma, Sampdoria and Udinese. He scored a late equalizer against Al-Masry on 10 January 2015, in what was the first meeting between the clubs since the 2012 Port Said Stadium riot. Sobhi attracted international attention after he stood on the ball in a 2–0 win against Zamalek on 21 July 2015, which caused Hazem Emam to kick out at Sobhi and was sent off. Al Ahly ended the 2014–15 campaign in second place behind their arch rivals Zamalek.

Sobhi caused controversy in the 2015 Egyptian Super Cup against Zamalek as he repeated his stand on the ball trick which enraged the Zamalek players. Al Ahly went on to win the match 3–2 and he later apologized for his showboating. He was sent off for the first time in his career on 15 April 2016 in a match against ENPPI, for an argument with an ENNPI player at half time. Sobhi played in 28 league matches for Al Ahly in 2015–16 under Martin Jol as the side claimed another league title.

Sobhi signed for Premier League club Stoke City on 25 July 2016 for a fee of £5 million. He made his Premier League debut for Stoke on 20 August 2016 against Manchester City. He made his first assist for Stoke on 31 October 2016 in a 3–1 win against Swansea City as his cross was deflected in by Alfie Mawson for an own goal. He made his first Premier League start in the next match against West Ham United, becoming the first teenager to start a league game for Stoke in nine years. After returning from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, Sobhi impressed in home wins over Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough. Sobhi played 19 times in 2016–17, as Stoke finished in 13th position.

Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, Sobhi signed a new five-year contract with the Potters. He scored his first goal for Stoke on 23 August 2017 in a 4–0 EFL Cup win over Rochdale. He scored his first Premier League goal on 23 December 2017, in a 3–1 win against West Bromwich Albion. He followed this up with a goal against Huddersfield Town in a 1–1 on boxing day. Sobhi made 27 appearances in 2017–18 as Stoke suffered relegation to the EFL Championship.

Sobhi joined Huddersfield Town on 12 June 2018, signing a three-year deal for a fee of £5.7 million.

On 28 December 2018 Sobhi came back to his old club Al Ahly as a loan from Huddersfield for 6 months for a fee of £800,000.

Sobhi made his national team debut against Tanzania on 14 June 2015 in the first round of 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the age of 17 years, 11 months and 18 days, to become the second youngest player to ever play for the Egyptian national team after Mido. On 29 March he scored his first international goal on top level, in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game against Nigeria. In January Sobhi was selected by Héctor Cúper in the Egyptian squad that competed in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Sobhi was mainly used as a substitute in the competition, featuring in four games out of the six as Egypt lost in the final to Cameroon. In May 2018 he was named in Egypt's preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Sobhi is mostly used upfront on either wings, although he also can be used as an attacking midfielder or a secondary striker. His style of play, which combines dribbling, clinical passing, vision, and an eye for goal, made him dubbed on several occasions as the new Mohamed Aboutrika, who is considered to be one of Egypt's greatest footballers.

Speaking in February 2016, Sobhi stated that he supports Spanish side Real Madrid. He is married to Habiba Ekramy, sister of Ahly ex-teammate and national teammate Sherif Ekramy.

Rajiv van La Parra

Rajiv Ramon van La Parra (born 4 June 1991) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays for Football League Championship club Middlesbrough on loan from Huddersfield Town, predominantly as a winger but also as a striker. He has also represented Netherlands U21.

Van La Parra played his first senior games in France with Caen before returning to the Netherlands in 2011 for a three-season-long stay with Heerenveen. In June 2014, he moved to England to join Wolverhampton Wanderers, who loaned him to Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town before he joined the latter in 2016.

Van La Parra is a product of the Feyenoord youth system, but made his senior debut instead for French Ligue 1 club Caen on 8 November 2008, having agreed a four-year contract in June 2008. He cited the potential to reach the highest level while playing in France as the reason for his transfer.

The right winger made only two appearances for Caen's first team during his first season, and the club ended the campaign being relegated. Despite this relegation, Van La Parra would make only a further eight appearances as the team won promotion back to the top flight, but did register his first senior goal; against Guingamp on 5 April 2009. During these seasons, he instead gained playing time in Caen's second team that competed in the Championnat de France amateur.

In summer 2011, his contract was terminated and he returned to the Netherlands in search of a new club. After an unsuccessful trial at AZ Alkmaar, he eventually signed a one-year contract with fellow Eredivisie side Heerenveen on 30 August 2011. After scoring six times during 26 appearances in his debut season, Heerenveen elected to take up an option in his contract for two further seasons. Over these three seasons, Van La Parra made 94 appearances (including playing in the Europa League), scoring 16 times.

His contract from Heerenveen expired in the summer of 2014, and after rejecting a new contract, on 10 June it was announced that he would move to English Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom he had signed a three-year contract. He made his debut in the first match on 10 August 2014 against Norwich City, and was named man of the match. He scored his first goal for Wolves against Fulham in the FA Cup on 13 January 2015. His first league goal came against future club Brighton & Hove Albion in a 1–1 draw on 14 March 2015.

On 26 November 2015, Van La Parra signed a loan deal with Brighton, lasting until 2 January 2016.

On 11 March 2016, after some speculation, Van La Parra signed on loan for fellow Championship side Huddersfield Town for the rest of the season, with the move becoming a permanent deal in the summer, on a three-year contract. He made his debut for the Terriers in the 4–1 West Yorkshire derby win against Leeds United at Elland Road on 19 March, and scored his first goal in their 1–0 win over his former club Wolves at the Kirklees Stadium on 27 August.

His first name Rajiv is a tribute to former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the son of former prime minister Indira Gandhi, assassinated in May 1991. One of his half-brothers, Georginio Wijnaldum, currently plays for Liverpool, while another, Giliano Wijnaldum, plays for Sparta Rotterdam. His cousin, Giovanni Drenthe, is also a professional footballer, while another, Royston Drenthe, came out of retirement and now plays for Sparta Rotterdam.

Rekeil Pyke

Rekeil Leshaun Pyke (born 1 September 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for EFL League One side Rochdale, on loan from Premier League club Huddersfield Town.

A product of the Huddersfield Town Academy, he was loaned out to Wrexham in November 2016, Colchester United in January 2017, and Port Vale in July 2017. He returned to Wrexham on loan for the first half of the 2018–19 season, before moving on loan to Rochdale for the second half of the campaign.

Born in Leeds, Pyke is a product of the Huddersfield Town Academy. He first joined the club at under-12 level from local junior side Rothwell Juniors. He signed his first professional contract in February 2015, having already represented the under-21 team at the age of 17. He joined National League side Wrexham on a month long loan in November 2016. He made his debut on 29 November in Wrexham's 1–0 defeat at Lincoln City. "Dragons" manager Dean Keates said Pyke "did okay... the physicality was all new to him, a new environment, but there is still a lot more to come from him". After three appearances at the Racecourse Ground, Pyke returned to Huddersfield at the end of his loan spell on 28 December. On 30 January 2017, Pyke joined League Two club Colchester United on loan until the end of the 2016–17 season. He came on as a second-half substitute for Owen Garvan to make his professional debut on 15 February during Colchester's 3–2 defeat to Crawley Town at the Colchester Community Stadium. He made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Mansfield Town on 14 March, after which "U's" manager John McGreal said he was "delighted" with Pyke, describing him as a "beast of a kid". He failed to score in four league starts and eight substitute appearances for Colchester.<ref name="Games played by Rekeil Pyke in 2016/2017"></ref>

On 11 July 2017, Pyke joined League Two side Port Vale on loan for the entire 2017–18 season. Manager Michael Brown warned fans not to burden the teenager with too much expectation after Pyke scored four goals in his first two pre-season friendly matches. However he struggled to even appear on the first-team bench, and speaking in October, new manager Neil Aspin blamed league rules that prevented him from naming more than five loanees in a matchday squad. He then picked up a hamstring injury in a reserve team game and returned to the Kirklees Stadium for treatment. He was recalled to Huddersfield permanently on 2 January 2018.

On 10 July 2018, he returned to Wrexham on a season-long loan for the 2018–19 season. He scored five goals in 27 appearances, being absent from Graham Barrow's first-team only during a six week spell at Christmas when he was in recovery from a hamstring injury. He was recalled to Huddersfield on 30 January; Welsh newspaper "The Leader" reported that "Pyke's departure is a big blow in Wrexham's push for a top-seven finish". On 30 January 2019, he moved up two divisions from Wrexham to join struggling League One side Rochdale on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.

Port Vale assistant manager Chris Morgan said that Pyke was "quick and powerful" and had good finishing skills.
