==Surname==
A grandparent of Jonas Lössl is [[German (people)|German]]. For this reason, his surname is written with "ö" instead of "ø" which is otherwise the normal spelling of this letter in the Danish language.&lt;ref name="nullfuenfmixedzone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nullfuenfmixedzone.de/die-nummer-1-der-grossen-stadt|title=Die Nummer 1 in der großen Stadt|author=Christian Karn|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=17 July 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swr.de/sport/der-neue-mainz-05-torwart-jonas-loessl-im-portraet/-/id=1208948/did=17738004/nid=1208948/128nx27/|title=Torwart Jonas Lössl ist von Mainz beeindruckt|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=17 July 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===FC Midtjylland===
A product of the [[FC Midtjylland]] football academy, Lössl made his [[Danish Superliga]] debut with [[FC Midtjylland]] in March 2010. He played a total number of 137 matches for the club.

===Guingamp===
On 5 June 2014, FC Midtjylland reported that they had sold Lössl to French football club, [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCM sælger Jonas Lossl til Guingamp|url=https://www.tv3sport.dk/sport/fodbold/nyheder/fcm-saelger-jonas-lossl-til-guingamp|accessdate=13 September 2017|publisher=tv3sport.dk|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially starting his first season as a backup keeper at the club, Lössl eventually established himself as the club's first-choice keeper in his two seasons at the club.

===Mainz 05===
On 16 June 2016, it was reported that Lössl was making a move to German club [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]]. The club cited that they intended Lössl to be the instant replacement for the club's previous keeper, [[Loris Karius]], who himself had just transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transferchok: Jonas Lössl skifter til Bundesligaen|url=https://www.tv3sport.dk/sport/fodbold/nyheder/transferchok-jonas-lossl-skifter-til-bundesligaen|accessdate=13 September 2017|publisher=tv3sport.dk|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huddersfield Town (loan)====
After one season at Mainz, Lössl signed for [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on a season-loan on 30 June 2017.&lt;ref name="htafc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.htafc.com/news/2017/june/loan-goalkeeper-jonas-lossl-joins-town/|title=Huddersfield Town LOAN: GOALKEEPER JONAS LÖSSL JOINS TOWN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2017, Lössl made his debut for Huddersfield in a 3–0 win against Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/12/crystal-palace-huddersfield-town-premier-league-match-report|title=Steve Mounié double gives Huddersfield perfect start against Crystal Palace|first=Paul Doyle at Selhurst|last=Park|date=12 August 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Town===
Following a successful loan spell in which he kept 10 Premier League clean sheets, Huddersfield activated a clause in Lössl's loan deal from Mainz, and signed him permanently for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43431813 |title=Jonas Lossl: Huddersfield Town to sign Mainz goalkeeper on permanent deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2018 |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lössl played 22 games for various Danish national youth teams, including 15 games for the [[Denmark under-21 national football team]].

He was called up to the senior [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] squad in June 2015 for a friendly against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denmark 2–1 Montenegro|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/international-friendlies/2015/denmark-montenegro_mtc763517/live.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=eurosport.co.uk|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] play-off against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denmark announces squad for Euro 2016 qualifying play-offs |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/950467.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=globaltimes.cn|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his senior debut coming on as a subsistute for [[Kasper Schmeichel]] against Scotland in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35862178|title=Scotland 1–0 Denmark|date=29 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 Lössl was named in Denmark's preliminary 35-man [[Denmark national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? - Goal.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Anyanwu Billing''' (born 11 June 1996) is a Danish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark U21]]s as a [[midfielder]].

==Playing career==
After signing for [[Esbjerg fB|Esbjerg]] in his native Denmark, Billing joined Huddersfield Town in 2013 on a youth contract. Billing signed a four-year professional contract in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Prof-kontrakt-til-dansk-Huddersfield-talent/|title=Prof-kontrakt til dansk Huddersfield-talent|first=|last=bold.dk|website=bold.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; After performing well for both the under-18s and under-21s, he made his first team debut for the club as a substitute in their 2–0 loss against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the [[John Smith's Stadium]] on 26 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27084044|title=Huddersfield Town 0-2 Leicester City|date=2014-04-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-12-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first start for the Terriers came 18 months later in their 2–2 draw against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the [[Madejski Stadium]] on 3 November 2015. His first goal for the club came from a 30-yard strike against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at the [[City Ground]] in a 2–0 win for the Terriers on 13 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35509360|title=Nottingham Forest 0-2 Huddersfield Town|date=2016-02-13|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-12-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November 2016, he scored his second goal for the club with a volley from 32 yards out in a 3–2 loss against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37958534|title=Cardiff City 3-2 Huddersfield Town|date=2016-11-19|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-12-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billing got slowly more and more space in the squad. After 10 good matches in the 2015–16 season, Billing signed a contract extension in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/billing-forlaenger-med-huddersfield/ Billing forlænger med Huddersfield]‚ bold.dk, 31 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He got his breakthrough in the 2016–17 season.

After the season, Billing was named as the youth player of the season in Huddersfield and his goal against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in November 2016 was voted goal of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/premier-league/flere-priser-til-philip-billing-ved-huddersfields-prisuddeling Flere priser til Philip Billing ved Huddersfields prisuddeling], tipsbladet.dk, 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, Billing suffered [[Racism in association football|racial abuse]] on social media; the matter was reported to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47552029|title=Philip Billing: Huddersfield contact police after midfielder racially abused on social media|date=13 March 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne City===
Mooy was released by Western Sydney Wanderers on 21 May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/wswanderersfc/news-display/Wanderers-Announce-Player-Departures/90596 |title=Wanderers Announce Player Departures |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=Western Sydney Wanderers FC |accessdate=28 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521152418/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/wswanderersfc/news-display/Wanderers-Announce-Player-Departures/90596 |archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was announced to have joined A-League rivals [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] the same day.

Mooy became the youngest ever marquee player in [[A-League]] history when he re-signed with [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] for the [[2015–16 A-League|2015–16 season]]. On 29 September, he scored a [[hat-trick]] against [[Heidelberg United]] in the [[FFA Cup]] quarter finals with two of the goals coming from outside the box, and in doing this he also became the first ever City player to score a hat-trick in the FFA Cup. During his time with Melbourne City, [[Socceroos]] manager [[Ange Postecoglou]] labelled him the "best and most exciting player in the [[A-League]]", while former Socceroo goalkeeper [[Mark Bosnich]] described him as "the best Australian midfielder playing anywhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/melbourneheart/news-display/Aaron-Mooy-joins-Melbourne-Heart-FC/90581 |title=Aaron Mooy joins Melbourne Heart FC |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=Melbourne Heart FC |accessdate=28 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521065900/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/melbourneheart/news-display/Aaron-Mooy-joins-Melbourne-Heart-FC/90581 |archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne City were reported to have rejected a $2m offer for Mooy from Saudi Arabia club [[Al-Nassr FC|Al-Nassr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/melbourne-city/melbourne-city-reject-record-offer-from-alnassr-for-socceroos-star-aaron-mooy-20151210-glkg2k.html |title=Melbourne City reject record offer from Al-Nassr for Socceroos star Aaron Mooy |first=Dominic |last=Bossi |newspaper=The Age |date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 2016, he assisted [[Bruno Fornaroli]] for two of his three goals to move to 20 assists for the season; an all time [[A League|A-League]] record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/bruno-fornaroli-scores-his-18th-goal-of-the-season-to-give-melbourne-city-lead-over-sydney-fc/news-story/a16d03ebc34d9f20da5b69a10f4ba644 |title=Bruno Fornaroli scores his 18th, 19th and 20th goals of season to give Melbourne City win over Sydney FC |first=Michael |last=Puterflam |publisher=Fox Sports |date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooy was involved in the squad that won the Championship Play-off Final, scoring one of Huddersfields's four penalties in the penalty shootout against Reading.

On 15 June 2017, it was reported that Huddersfield had agreed a fee with Manchester City to sign Mooy on a permanent basis. The fee was reported to be £8&amp;nbsp;million initially, with a potential to rise to £10&amp;nbsp;million depending on add-ons. Man City would also have a buy-back clause for Mooy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40289316 |title=Aaron Mooy: Huddersfield Town agree club-record £10m fee with Man City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was finalised on 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.htafc.com/news/2017/june/transfer-aaron-mooy-joins-town-permanently/ |title=Huddersfield Town TRANSFER: AARON MOOY JOINS TOWN PERMANENTLY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooy made his [[Premier League]] debut for Huddersfield in their first game of the [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18 season]], a 3–0 win over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], Mooy himself involved in two of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/08/13/mooy-assist-mode-huddersfield-thump-palace |title=Mooy in assist mode as Huddersfield thump Palace |website=The World Game |publisher=SBS |date=13 August 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first Premier League goal one week later, the only goal of the game as Huddersfield defeated [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40914669 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Huddersfield Town 1–0 Newcastle United |date=20 August 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2017, Mooy scored the opening goal as Huddersfield upset [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–1 in a Premier League clash at [[Kirklees Stadium|John Smith's Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-22/mooy-the-man-as-huddersfield-shock-manchester-united/9074026?section=sport |title=Aaron Mooy scores as Huddersfield shocks Manchester United |publisher=ABC News |date=22 October 2017 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Cameroon-Australia (21) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Mooy playing for [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in 2017]]

Mooy was eligible to represent [[Germany national football team|Germany]] or the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] through his parents.&lt;ref name="adelaidenow.com.au"/&gt;

Mooy made 10 appearances for the [[Young Socceroos]] between 2008 and 2009 and scored four goals. He played at the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and played in two group stage games before Australia were eliminated, scoring in his second game against [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]]. He was called up to the senior [[Socceroos|Australian]] side in August 2009, for a friendly match against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100196:australia-squad-named-for-ireland-friendly&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Australia squad named for Ireland friendly |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Mooy declared his desire to play for [[Australia Olympic football team|Australia]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=St Mirren kid Aaron Mooy: I'd love to be part of Australia's 2012 Olympic squad |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/st-mirren-kid-aaron-mooy-1089810 |newspaper=Daily Record |date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were unsuccessful in their [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's Asian Qualifiers|qualifying campaign]] for [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|London 2012]].

On 7 December 2012, he made his international debut with the [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] against [[Guam national football team|Guam]] scoring a free-kick to open the scoring in a game the Socceroos would win 9–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aaron Mooy scores on Socceroo Debut |url=http://www.westsydneyfootball.com/_/player-articles/aaron-mooy-scores-on-socceroo-debut-r240 |publisher=Western Sydney Football |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following game against [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]], Mooy again scored a free-kick as the Socceroos won 8–0 and qualified for the [[EAFF East Asian Cup]].

On 11 March 2015, Mooy was selected in a squad to play [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. On 3 September 2015, he scored the fifth goal in a 5–0 defeat of [[Bangladesh national football team|Bangladesh]] in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] in Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australia put five past Bangladesh in second straight WC qualifier as well as another against Jordan later in qualifying. win |url=http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-afc/match/433434/australia-bangladesh/report |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=3 September 2015 |date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also holds a Dutch passport due to his mother's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lntup.com/2017/06/30/huddersfield-town-permanently-sign-aaron-mooy/ |title=Huddersfield Town permanently sign Aaron Mooy |date=30 June 2017|access-date=25 November 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201054434/https://www.lntup.com/2017/06/30/huddersfield-town-permanently-sign-aaron-mooy/ |archivedate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurent Depoitre''' (born 7 December 1988) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

==Club career==
===Eendracht Aalst===
When a large number of players had to leave Péruwelz after the 2008–09 season, [[Eendracht Aalst]] took advantage of the situation in the summer of 2009 and signed Depoitre alongside Damien Galucci and Olivier De Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redant|first1=Wim|title=VOETBAL 3DE KLASSE Laurent Depoitre (20) is de nieuwe aanvalsleider van Eendracht Aalst|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/s22cq512|publisher=Nieuwsblad|accessdate=11 October 2015|language=Dutch|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depoitre formed a good pair in Alost with [[Wouter Moreels]], and he was chosen as the best player of the team after his first season. 2011, the team became champion in [[Belgian Third Division|Third Division]] A. In the 2011–12 season Depoitre was followed by, among other clubs, [[AA Gent]], [[Lierse SK]], [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], [[K. Beerschot AC|Beerschot AC]], [[N.E.C.]], [[Sc Heerenveen|Heerenveen]], [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] and [[Roda JC]].&lt;ref name="kvo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transfernieuws|url=http://kvo.be/news/detail.phtml?id=1311|publisher=KV Oostende|accessdate=11 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420113646/http://kvo.be/news/detail.phtml?id=1311|archivedate=20 April 2013|language=Dutch|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oostende===
In 2012, Depoitre joined Oostende from Aalst.&lt;ref name="kvo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sportwereld"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smet|first1=Stefan|title=Laurent Depoitre naar AA Gent|trans-title=Laurent Depoitre to AA Gent|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/cnt/dmf20140326_01041941|publisher=Sportwereld|accessdate=11 October 2015|language=Dutch|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, it was announced that he would be transferred to [[SV Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] in 2013–14. Afterwards, his transfer turned out to be a part of a share transaction between [[Yves Lejaeghere]], the then-president of Ostend, and [[Patrick Decuyper]], the then-general manager of Zulte Waregem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vandenabeele|first1=Christian|title=Laurent Depoitre: KV Oostende of Zulte Waregem?

===Gent===
After Depoitre decided not to extend his contract with Oostende, it was announced that he would play for KAA Gent during the 2014–2015 season.&lt;ref name="Sportwereld"/&gt;

===Porto===
On 8 August 2016, Depoitre signed for Portuguese club [[FC Porto|Porto]] for four seasons, with €40 million release fee. Porto paid a €6 million transfer fee to [[K.A.A.

==Club career==
===Montpellier===
Mounié is a [[Montpellier HSC]] youth academy graduate. He made his first team debut on 28 October 2014 in a [[2014–15 Coupe de la Ligue]] round of 32 home match against [[AC Ajaccio]], replacing [[Jean Deza]] after 86 minutes; Montpellier lost the match 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/10/28/france/coupe-de-la-ligue/montpellier-herault-sport-club/athletic-club-ajaccien/1949315/|title=Montpellier vs Ajaccio 0–1 |publisher=Soccerway|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2015, Mounié was loaned to [[Nîmes Olympique]] of [[Ligue 2]] for the rest of the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Deux-recrues-pour-nimes/586626|title=Trois recrues pour Nîmes|work=L'Équipe|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the club's top scorer for the season, with 11 goals in 33 competitive matches, all of them scored during the [[2015–16 Ligue 2|league campaign]].

On 29 June 2016, Mounié extended his contract with Montpellier by two years to 30 June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Montpellier-steve-mounie-prolonge-son-contrat/700705|title=Montpellier : Steve Mounié prolonge son contrat|work=L'Équipe|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 2017, Mounié scored for the fifth consecutive Ligue 1 match in a 3–2 home loss to [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]; it was his 13th league goal of the [[2016-17 Ligue 1|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/sala-nets-winner-as-nantes-beat-montpellier.htm|title=Sala nets winner as Nantes beat Montpellier|publisher=ligue1.com|date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Town===
On 5 July 2017, Mounié joined newly-promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on a four-year deal for a club record fee of €13 million (£11.5 million) plus add-ons. The record fee surpassed the previous record £8 million (initial fee) that the club spent on [[Aaron Mooy]] from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] a week earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40503864|title=Steve Mounie: Huddersfield sign Montpellier striker for a club-record fee|publisher=BBC|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounié made his competitive debut on 12 August 2017, scoring twice in Huddersfield's first match in the division, a 3–0 win at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doyale|first1=Paul|title=Steve Mounié double gives Huddersfield perfect start against Crystal Palace|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/12/crystal-palace-huddersfield-town-premier-league-match-report|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2018, he scored, assisted  Mooy and forced an own goal in a 4–1 home win over [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42934991|title=Huddersfield Town 4–1 Bournemouth|date=2018-02-11|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathias Jattah-Njie Jørgensen''' ({{IPA-da|ˈjɶɐ̯n̩sn̩}}; born 23 April 1990), commonly known as '''Zanka''', is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre back]] for the {{English football updater|HuddersT}} club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]].

He began his career at boyhood club [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC Copenhagen]], playing regularly in five [[Danish Superliga|Superliga]] seasons, before a move to [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 2012, where he spent two seasons in the Eredivisie before returning to Denmark after finding his chances limited. He joined Huddersfield Town in July 2017 for a fee of £3.5&amp;nbsp;million.

Formerly an international at under-16, [[Denmark national under-17 football team|under-17]], under-18 and [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21 level]], Jørgensen made his senior international debut for [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] aged 18 in November 2008.

==Career==
===FC Copenhagen===
Born to a Danish mother and a Gambian father, Jørgensen moved to [[FC Copenhagen]] from neighbouring club [[Boldklubben af 1893|B.93]], where he had played in first-team matches even at the young age of 16. He signed a three-year contract with FCK on 26 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=754&amp;newsid=6907|title=Stortalent til F.C. København|publisher=[[F.C. Copenhagen]]|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=26 June 2007|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before signing with the Danish champions, he had visited [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for a one-week trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/sas-liga/%C2%BBzanka%C2%AB-kastede-haandtegn-med-thierry-henry |title=Lørdagstræning i PARKEN |publisher=[[TV 2 Sport (Denmark)|TV 2 Sport]] |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2007, Jørgensen strained the inner ligament in the left knee in a reserve team match – less than a month after he moved to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=7075 |title=Lørdagstræning i PARKEN |publisher=[[F.C. Copenhagen]] |date=18 August 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September, he played again for the reserve team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=7164 |title=Christiansen: – Bedre dag for dag |publisher=[[F.C. Copenhagen]] |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first team debut came on 26 September 2007 in a [[Danish Cup|cup]] match against [[FC Fredericia]]. He substituted [[Oscar Wendt]] 5 minutes before full-time, in the match FCK won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=1791&amp;msa=summary |title=26.09. FC Fredericia – F.C.

Only 8 days after his first team debut, Jørgensen was thrown on pitch in the [[extra time]] of the [[UEFA Cup]] first round second leg at [[Parken Stadium]] against [[RC Lens]], after captain [[Michael Gravgaard]] had received a red card. He was substituted for [[Marcus Allbäck]] and played in the central defence together with [[Brede Hangeland]], and they prevented any more goals for Lens, when they were 10 against 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=1798&amp;msa=summary |title=04.10.

On 19 November 2008, he made his debut for the [[Danish national football team]] in a friendly against [[Wales national football team|Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Bellamy-matchvinder-i-Broendby |title=Bellamy matchvinder i Brøndby |publisher=[[bold.dk]] |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Roland Nilsson]] became manager for [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] he became captain for "The Lions". 22 February 2012 it was announced that Jørgensen would join Dutch club [[PSV Eindhoven]] on a free transfer during the summer transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1758187.html |title=Jørgensen agrees to swap København for PSV |work=uefa.com |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PSV===
Jørgensen was featured in an unofficial pre-season tournament, The Polish Masters, in July 2012 and scored his first goal for PSV in their game against [[S.L. Benfica]] on 22 July. However, he struggled to break into PSV's first XI and only played 14 matches for the club over the course of two years.

===Return to FC Copenhagen===
On 7 July 2014, Jørgensen returned to his former team [[FC Copenhagen]] for a fee of around 600,000 Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officielt: FCK henter Zanka hjem|url=http://sporten.tv2.dk/2014-07-07-officielt-fck-henter-zanka-hjem|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Town===
On 7 July 2017, Huddersfield Town confirmed the signing of Jørgensen from FC Copenhagen for £3.5&amp;nbsp;million on a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.htafc.com/news/2017/july/transfer-mathias-jorgensen-joins-town/ |title=TRANSFER: MATHIAS JØRGENSEN JOINS TOWN |publisher=Huddersfield Town A.F.C. |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In May 2018 he was named in Denmark's preliminary 35-man [[Denmark national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - Final 23-man lists - Goal.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jørgensen dated with Hungarian model [[Enikő Mihalik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hir24.hu/bulvar/2014/07/15/mihalik-eniko-megtalalta-az-igazit/|title=Mihalik Enikő megtalálta az igazit|date=15 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
Jørgensen received his nickname, "Zanka", from the movie [[Cool Runnings]], in which the character played by [[Doug E. Doug]] is named Sanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/fra-til-z-som-zanka-8 |title=Fra A til Z som Zanka |publisher=[[sporten.dk]] |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname was coined by Johan Lange in 2000, while both Lange and Jørgensen were playing for [[Boldklubben af 1893|B.93]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tipsbladet.dk/artikel/manden-bag-zanka |title=Manden bag Zanka |publisher=[[tipsbladet.dk]] |accessdate=20 August 2017 |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lange would go on to be one of the assistant managers during Jørgensen's first spell at FC Copenhagen, and he would later serve as the technical director when Jørgensen returned to the club in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fck.dk/node/30537 |title=Johan Lange |publisher=[[F. C. København]] |accessdate=20 August 2017 |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was formerly the captain of his hometown team, [[TSV 1860 Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/vereine/2-bundesliga/2011-12/1860-muenchen-5/58074/spieler_schindler-christopher.html | title = Schindler, Christopher | language = German | publisher = kicker.de | accessdate = 30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been captaining the team since [[Julian Weigl]] was suspended to the second squad and fined for disciplinary reasons early in the [[2014–15 2. Bundesliga|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tz.de/sport/1860-muenchen/julian-weigl-1860-kapitaensbinde-dauerhaft-3776992.html | title = Weigl-Binde dauerhaft weg!

'''Jason David Ian Puncheon''' (born 18 June 1986)&lt;!-- See talk page --&gt; is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], on loan from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Following his goal against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on his [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] debut, he has scored in all of the top four divisions of English league football, scoring for [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in [[EFL League One|League One]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and Blackpool, Southampton and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Croydon]], Greater London, Puncheon began his career with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], and moved [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|with the team]] to Milton Keynes, where the club became [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in 2004. He was released in January 2006. He moved to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in June of the same year, after brief spells with [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] and [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]].&lt;ref name="whoswho07"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hugman |first=Barry |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2007–08 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84596-246-3 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[FA Cup]] Player of the Third Round in 2007 and the following season after scoring a succession of brilliant goals (including a last minute 35-yard free kick versus Bradford) was named in the PFA Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="FAC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6271595.stm |title=Puncheon nets FA Cup player award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plymouth Argyle===
[[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] signed Puncheon from Barnet for £250,000 in 2008. He endured an unsuccessful 18-month spell at the club, making six league appearances. He was loaned to former club MK Dons three times in two years, where he scored 11 goals in 51 appearances.

===Southampton===
On 30 January 2010, Puncheon joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] which then led to his loan deal at MK Dons to be cut short.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~1949524,00.html |title=Puncheon joins Saints |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201051858/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~1949524%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in a 5–1 victory over Walsall, and scored again a few days later, in a 5–0 victory over Huddersfield.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, he was a regular in the first team. However, when [[Alan Pardew]] lost his job just days after a 4–0 win away to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], Southampton hired [[Nigel Adkins]] as manager. Under Adkins, he stayed in the first team, but found himself under increasing pressure from [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] for his place. Eventually Adkins lost patience with Puncheon's erratic performances, and dropped him to the bench in favour of 17-year-old Chamberlain, who was later sold to Arsenal for a reported £15m. On 16 November 2010, Puncheon moved on an emergency loan deal to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jason To Join Lions |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2222518,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=17 November 2010 |date=16 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119000200/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~2222518%2C00.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on his first game for Millwall in their 1–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Millwall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9194875.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 December 2010 |date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2011, Puncheon scored a [[hat-trick]] in the 3–0 victory over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millwall 3–0 Crystal Palace |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9322923.stm |accessdate=1 January 2011 |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajiv Ramon van La Parra''' (born 4 June 1991) is a Dutch professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Football League Championship]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C|Middlesbrough]] on loan from [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], predominantly as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] but also as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]]. He has also represented [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands U21]].

Van La Parra played his first senior games in France with [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] before returning to the Netherlands in 2011 for a three-season-long stay with [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]]. In June 2014, he moved to England to join [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who loaned him to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] and [[Huddersfield Town]] before he joined the latter in 2016.

==Club career==
===Caen===
[[File:Rajiv-van-la-para.jpg|thumb|right|Van La Parra training with [[SM Caen|Caen]] in 2010.]]
Van La Parra is a product of the [[Feyenoord]] youth system, but made his senior debut instead for [[Ligue 1|French Ligue 1]] club [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] on 8 November 2008, having agreed a four-year contract in June 2008.&lt;ref name="Caen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caen.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Football-Van-La-Parra-atout-jeune-et-orange-a-Caen-_spo-650285_actu.Htm|title=Van La Parra atout jeune et orange a Caen|language=French|publisher=Caen.maville.com |date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the potential to reach the highest level while playing in France as the reason for his transfer.&lt;ref name="Caen"/&gt;

The right winger made only two appearances for Caen's first team during his first season, and the club ended the campaign being relegated. Despite this relegation, Van La Parra would make only a further eight appearances as the team won promotion back to the top flight, but did register his first senior goal; against [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] on 5 April 2009.&lt;ref name="Footnational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foot-national.com/36-3370-81-saison-football-Van-La-Parra-Rajiv.html |title=Van La Parra |language=French|publisher=foot-national.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these seasons, he instead gained playing time in Caen's second team that competed in the [[Championnat de France amateur]].&lt;ref name="Footnational"/&gt;

===Heerenveen===
In summer 2011, his contract was terminated and he returned to the Netherlands in search of a new club. After an unsuccessful trial at [[AZ Alkmaar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanvanaz.nl/archives/3825|title=Rajiv de la Parra week op proef bij AZ|language=Dutch|publisher=fanvanaz.nl|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually signed a one-year contract with fellow Eredivisie side [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]] on 30 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-heerenveen.nl/nieuws/sc-heerenveen-contracteert-van-la-parra/10|title=sc Heerenveen contracteert Van La Parra|language=Dutch|publisher=SC Heerenveen |date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring six times during 26 appearances in his debut season, Heerenveen elected to take up an option in his contract for two further seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-heerenveen.nl/nieuws/sc-heerenveen-legt-rajiv-van-la-parra-langer-vast/10|title=sc Heerenveen legt Rajiv van La Parra langer vast|language=Dutch|publisher=SC Heerenveen |date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over these three seasons, Van La Parra made 94 appearances (including playing in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]), scoring 16 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/spelers/carriere/rajiv-van-la-parra.htm|title=Rajiv van La Parra |language=Dutch|publisher=Voetbal International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
His contract from Heerenveen expired in the summer of 2014, and after rejecting a new contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/van-la-parra-kan-verlengen-kum-moet-vertrekken-.htm|title=Van La Parra kan verlengen, Kum moet vertrekken|language=Dutch |publisher=SC Heerenveen |date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 June it was announced that he would move to [[Football League Championship|English Championship]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], with whom he had signed a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27782113|title=Wolves sign Heerenveen winger Rajiv van La Parra|publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first match on 10 August 2014 against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and was named [[man of the match]]. He scored his first goal for Wolves against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 13 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30691987|title=Wolves 3–3 Fulham|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 January 2015|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first league goal came against future club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] in a 1–1 draw on 14 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31776093|title=Brighton 1–1 Wolves|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 March 2015|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2015, Van La Parra signed a loan deal with Brighton, lasting until 2 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34938160|title=Man Utd's Wilson &amp; Wolves' Van La Parra join Brighton on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Town===
On 11 March 2016, after some speculation, Van La Parra signed on loan for fellow Championship side [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] for the rest of the season, with the move becoming a permanent deal in the summer, on a three-year contract. He made his debut for the Terriers in the 4–1 [[West Yorkshire derby]] win against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[Elland Road]] on 19 March, and scored his first goal in their 1–0 win over his former club Wolves at the [[Kirklees Stadium]] on 27 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Personal life==
His first name Rajiv is a tribute to former [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the son of former prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated in May 1991.&lt;ref name="Caen"/&gt; One of his half-brothers, [[Georginio Wijnaldum]], currently plays for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], while another, [[Giliano Wijnaldum]], plays for [[Sparta Rotterdam]]. His cousin, [[Giovanni Drenthe]], is also a professional footballer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/spotlight-on-georginio-wijnaldum-newcastles-new-dutch-delight/|title=Spotlight on Georginio Wijnaldum: Newcastle's new Dutch delight – Football Oranje|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another, [[Royston Drenthe]], came out of retirement and now plays for [[Sparta Rotterdam]].
