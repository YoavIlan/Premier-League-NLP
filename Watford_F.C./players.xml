}}
'''Heurelho da Silva Gomes''' (born 15 February 1981), better known as '''Heurelho Gomes''', is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He previously made a name for himself at Dutch club [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], and also spent six years at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

==Club career==

===Cruzeiro===
Gomes began as a [[forward (association football)|forward]], only becoming a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at age 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Bate|title=Alisson, Ederson, and the rising reputation of Brazilian 'keepers|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=3 October 2018|work=Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11513746/alisson-ederson-and-the-rising-reputation-of-brazilian-keepers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes started his career in his native country Brazil at [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], where he played 59 games between 2001 and 2004. Here, he was scouted by [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]] and in July 2004, he was sold to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].

===PSV===
Gomes made his debut for the [[Eindhoven]] club against Serbian side [[Red Star Belgrade]] on 11 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Meesterscout Piet de Visser |url=http://sargasso.nl/archief/2008/02/08/meesterscout-piet-de-visser/ |publisher=Sargasso |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008 | language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, there were critics, saying that Brazilians "should be on the field, not in the goal". In other words, there were doubts if Gomes was reliable enough. Those doubts were quickly erased. Even though he conceded two goals in his debut against [[RBC Roosendaal|RBC]], which PSV won 5–2, he proved himself to be a reliable goalkeeper. He played a major part in PSV's four latest consecutive titles in the Eredivisie and in the great European achievements. In his first season, PSV immediately reached the semi-finals of the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], where in the 14 attempts before, PSV wasn't able to reach the second round. In the following seasons, PSV progressed each time from the group stage.

In the [[Eredivisie]], Gomes was known for his outstanding reflexes, which saved points for PSV more than once. Also his trademark throwing ability is well known. Gomes is able to throw the ball all the way deep into the opponents half. Also before the start of the match and second half, Gomes jumps up above the goal with his shoulders, pumping up the PSV supporters.

Gomes was a crowd favorite at PSV. He can speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and while in the Netherlands, he picked up a fair amount of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], although it has to be said he is not fluent in the language.

Even though the rivalry between PSV, [[Feyenoord]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] is intense, fans from rival clubs showed sympathy for the Brazilian.

Notable was an incident in [[Rotterdam]] in the match against Feyenoord, when Gomes injured himself whilst celebrating a goal, scored by his teammate [[Phillip Cocu]]. However, he managed to continue and even managed to pull off a wonder save, keeping his side in the game, which they went on to draw.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Following the appointment of manager [[Juande Ramos]], Gomes signed for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 27 June 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gomes deal agreed|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesdealagreed260608.html|work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=27 June 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a fee was believed to be around £7.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham pay £7m for Brazil goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article4222568.ece|work=Times.|publisher=www.times online.co.uk|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=14 February 2010| location=London| first=Gary| last=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes played his first game in Tottenham colours in a pre-season [[exhibition game|friendly match]] on 19 July 2008 against Spanish [[Segunda División B]] side [[CD Dénia|Dénia]], which Tottenham won 4–2.

Gomes eventually obtained a [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit]] to play in the United Kingdom, despite playing less than the 75% required number of games for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the last two years. Gomes made his home debut on 10 August 2008, keeping a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] with a 5–0 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on Tottenham's last pre-season friendly, before the [[2008–09 Premier League]] began.

Tottenham lost their two opening games 2–1 to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] respectively, but his presence in goal helped Spurs earn their first point of the season with a draw against [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. His reputation took a hit a week later, however, when he conceded a weak shot from [[Ashley Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7601910.stm|title=Tottenham 1–2 Aston Villa|author=Chris Whyatt|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Spurs' 2–1 home defeat against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. These blunders continued as he conceded an [[own goal]] in a [[London derbies|London derby]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 15 November 2008, which kept his club mired deep in the relegation zone and also caused Spurs goalkeeping coach [[Hans Leitert]] to be sacked on 19 November 2008, with the appointment of former Spurs goalkeeper [[Tony Parks]] made shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7737001.stm|title=Spurs goalkeeping coach departs|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes went on to put in a strong performance against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], saving two shots deep into the match in which Tottenham won 2–0, before making two important saves to deny [[Park Ji-sung]] and [[Ryan Giggs]] in a 0–0 draw with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gomes was injured in Spurs' 5–1 win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the second game of the [[2009–10 Premier League]] season and had to be replaced by second-choice goalkeeper [[Carlo Cudicini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8202440.stm |title=Hull 1 – 5 Tottenham |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport  |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2009|author=Sam Lyon }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an [[MRI]] scan, it was revealed that Gomes suffered damage to his groin which would keep him out for up to a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesupdate200809.html |title=Gomes update. |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his return to first team action in the 5–1 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 23 September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/peterthegreat230909.html |title=Peter the great! |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his Premier League comeback in the 2–1 win at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 17 October. During this match, the Brazilian made a handful of brilliant saves, one of which was compared by former Spurs goalkeeper [[Pat Jennings]] to a famous save made by [[Gordon Banks]] against Brazil in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesmiraclesavepat211009.html |title=Gomes' 'miracle save' – Pat. |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurent Koscielny-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Gomes (in green) clashing with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] defender [[Laurent Koscielny]] in a [[North London derby]] in November 2010]]
On 3 April 2010, he made two [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] saves out of three against in a 3–1 defeat away at Sunderland, then on 14 April, Gomes' fine form aided Spurs in picking up their first Premier League victory over Arsenal in 21 meetings; he saved a [[Robin van Persie]] free kick and several other attempts on goal in succession. The following week, on 17 April, Gomes again made several crucial saves as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2–1 as the team passed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to sit fourth in the League standings. He kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanders]] and then played a vital role in the 1–0 victory against Manchester City with two crucial saves which saw Tottenham get into the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time ever.

On 20 October 2010, Gomes received a [[ejection (sports)|red card]] for fouling [[Jonathan Biabiany]] within the first ten minutes of the first half against European Champions [[Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League]]. Tottenham Hotspur lost the match 4–3 after going 4–0 down inside the first 35 minutes, despite a second half [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] from [[Gareth Bale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Inter Milan 4 Tottenham 3|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/9102192.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=20 October 2010|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes' goalkeeping ability was called into question on 13 April 2011 in the second leg tie against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] after a long-shot from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] slipped out of Gomes' hands over his head and into the goal to put Real Madrid 5–0 up on aggregate. Gomes took blame for another controversial goal against Chelsea on 30 April after a shot from [[Frank Lampard]] slipped between his legs and although Gomes scrambled back and appeared to clear the ball, the goal was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9469237.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chelsea 2–1 Tottenham | date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs went on to lose the game 2–1.

After several high-profile errors and misjudgements by Gomes, Tottenham signed 40-year-old keeper [[Brad Friedel]] on a [[free transfer (association football)|free transfer]] from Aston Villa to provide competition in the first team. Friedel began the season as the starter with Gomes being relegated to the bench and later being left out of match day squads entirely, which led to immediate speculation regarding his future at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry ready to let Gomes go|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,,11675_7171541,00.html|publisher=SkySports.com|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes played his first match of the [[2011–12 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2011–12 season]] in a [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 6–7 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] after [[Massimo Luongo]] missed a penalty. Subsequently, Gomes played in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]], keeping a clean sheet in the 1–0 victory over [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]]. Following Spurs' deadline day capture of goalkeeper [[Hugo Lloris]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], Gomes slipped to fourth-choice at Spurs, but following the sale of Carlo Cudicini to the [[LA Galaxy]], he rose back to third-choice, behind Lloris and Friedel.

====Loan to 1899 Hoffenheim====
On the final day of the January 2013 transfer window, Gomes agreed to join German [[Bundesliga]] side [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]] on loan until the end of [[2012–13 Bundesliga|the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21275694 |title=Heurelho Gomes: Tottenham loan goalkeeper to Hoffenheim |work=BBC |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February, he made his debut as Hoffenheim won 2–1 against [[SC Freiburg]]. After the match, manager [[Marco Kurz]] praised Gomes, saying, "Gomes has shown a very solid performance. Although he has only trained once with us, his aura was strong." Throughout the match, Gomes made four crucial saves and looked assured in claiming six crosses, commanding his penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heurelho Gomes causes a stir on Hoffenheim debut|url=http://hereisthecity.com/2013/02/04/heurelho-gomes-causes-a-stir-on-hoffenheim-debut/|publisher=Here is the City|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his third match for Hoffenheim, he was already [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing the team, although his season ended prematurely when, on 6 April 2013, he broke his [[metacarpus]] during an important 3–0 home win over [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]]. He had to undergo hand surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.achtzehn99.de/saisonende-fuer-heurelho-gomes/ |language = German | title=Saisonende für Heurelho Gomes|publisher=achtzehn99.de|date=6 April 2013|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Tottenham====
After his injury, Gomes returned to Tottenham and started the [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2013–14 season]] with Spurs. Gomes' role remained as third-choice, however, as the backup to Brad Friedel and the club number one Hugo Lloris. On 22 May 2014, Tottenham announced that Gomes would leave the club the following month when his contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heurelho Gomes to depart Tottenham |url=http://www.espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1829876/heurelho-gomes-depart-tottenham?cc=5901 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heurelho Gomes 150314 Watford v Reading-92.jpg|thumbnail|Gomes warming-up for Watford.]]

===Watford===
Gomes signed a one-year deal, with an option of a second, at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 24 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140524-heurelho-gomes-signs-for-watford-1571831.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524101933/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140524-heurelho-gomes-signs-for-watford-1571831.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season with the Championship club Gomes played in 44 games helping the club gain [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League.

Following the Hornets' promotion to the Premier League, Gomes signed a new three-year contract with the club on 20 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/150520-heurelho-gomes-new-watford-fc-contract-2463252.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520162420/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/150520-heurelho-gomes-new-watford-fc-contract-2463252.aspx |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Player of the Season award at the end of the 2015/16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/heurelho-gomes |title=Heurelho Gomes Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Heurelho Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright|Gomes in an international [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 2006.]]
Gomes made his debut for Brazil in the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. Although the competition is for senior national teams, Brazil chose to send an under-23 squad to the competition. Gomes made five appearances as Brazil went to the final and finished second after being beaten by [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 1–0.

Despite being part of the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup squads#Brazil|Brazilian squad]] that won the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as the third-choice keeper behind [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] and [[Marcos Roberto Silveira Reis|Marcos]], Gomes did not receive any playing time. He was also excluded from then coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]]'s final [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|23-man roster]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany.

It was not until his inclusion in the team for a series of late-summer friendlies, as a consequence of new Brazil coach [[Dunga]]'s desire to play many of the ''Seleção's'' younger stars, that Gomes has finally gained some consistent playing time in goal. On 14 August 2006, he was called up for a friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], which ended in a 1–1 draw. On 3 September 2006, he played in Brazil's 3–0 win over rivals [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[Emirates Stadium]] in England. Two days later, Gomes kept a second consecutive clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[White Hart Lane]]. His latest stint between the sticks was during a 2–1 win over [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] on 10 October 2006.

On 11 May 2010, it was announced that Gomes would be part of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|Brazilian squad]] which would compete at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in South Africa, alongside [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]] and [[Doni (footballer)|Doni]]. Gomes made a rare appearance for Brazil in a World Cup warm-up game, replacing Brazil's number one keeper Júlio César as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2010/0602/1224271732343.html?

'''Daryl Janmaat''' (born 22 July 1989) is a Dutch professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

He began his career at [[ADO Den Haag]], and went on to play for the [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]] and [[Feyenoord]] before joining Newcastle on a six-year deal in 2014.

A full international since 2012, Janmaat has earned over 20 caps and was part of the Dutch team which finished third at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===ADO Den Haag===
Born in [[Leidschendam]], [[South Holland]], Janmaat started his senior career in [[2007–08 Eerste Divisie|2007–08]], with [[ADO Den Haag]] in the [[Eerste Divisie]].

===Heerenveen===
In the following off-season the 19-year-old moved straight into the [[Eredivisie]], signing for [[SC Heerenveen]]. In Heerenveen's [[2009-10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match against [[Hertha Berlin]] on 23 October 2009, Janmaat came on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Norwegian [[Christian Grindheim]] and received a red card three minutes later for a late challenge on [[Nemanja Pejčinović]] but Heerenveen held on for a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000037/match=2000818/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Heerenveen leave Hertha hurting |publisher=UEFA |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2009/10/22/europe/uefa-cup/hertha-bsc-berlin/sportclub-heerenveen/858309/ |title=Hertha BSC 0–1 Heerenveen |publisher=Soccerway |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving a required suspension, Janmaat scored in his next Europa League appearance on 16 December 2009, netting his side's final goal in a 5–0 win over [[FK Ventspils]] at the [[Abe Lenstra Stadion]] in Heerenveen but the win proved insufficient as Heerenveen failed to qualify for the knockout stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000037/match=2000902/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Hollow victory for Heerenveen |publisher=UEFA |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, Janmaat scored Heerenveen's ninth goal in an 11–1 thrashing of [[2011–12 Eerste Divisie|Eerste Divisie]] side [[FC Oss]] to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup|KNVB Beker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2557/news/2011/12/23/2814989/knvb-beker-results-psv-eliminate-twente-to-join-as |title=KNVB Beker Results: PSV eliminate Twente to join as Heerenveen score 11 to reach quarter-finals |publisher=Goal.com |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his four seasons with the club Janmaat was a starter in three after appearing in only ten games in [[2008–09 Eredivisie|his debut campaign]], which ended with [[2008–09 KNVB Cup|conquest]] of the [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]].

===Feyenoord===
In the middle of 2012, after his contract expired, he signed for fellow top-division side [[Feyenoord]], which he had already represented as a youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4016/main/2012/02/01/2879584/official-feyenoord-to-sign-heerenveens-daryl-janmaat-this |title=Official: Feyenoord to sign Heerenveen's Daryl Janmaat this summer |publisher=Goal.com |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Janmaat picked up two yellow cards in the space of one minute and was sent off on 9 December 2012 as Feyenoord drew with [[NAC Breda]] 2–2 in [[2012-13 Eredivisie|league]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/09/netherlands/eredivisie/nac-bv/feyenoord-rotterdam-nv/1290559/ |title=NAC Breda 2–2 Feyenoord |publisher=Soccerway |date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2013, he scored the winning goal for Feyenoord as they defeated [[FC Utrecht]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/dutch-eredivisie/11/video/1379030/highlights-feyenoord-2-1-utrecht |title=Highlights: Feyenoord 2–1 Utrecht |publisher=ESPNFC |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janmaat scored his first goal of the [[2013–14 Eredivisie]] season on 16 February 2014, converting a pass from [[Graziano Pellè]] as Feyenoord drew 1–1 with NAC Breda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voetbaluitslagen.nl/eredivisie/2013-2014/regulier-seizoen/speelweek-24/nac-breda-feyenoord-1478544/ |title=NAC Breda 1–1 Feyenoord |publisher=Voetbal Uitslagen |date=16 February 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April, he scored on the half-volley in the 76th minute as Feyenoord defeated [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] 2–0 in league play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/football/video-1096256/Newcastle-target-Janmaat-scores-great-goal-Feyenoord.html |title=Newcastle target Janmaat scores great goal for Feyenoord |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxsports.nl/video/206856-76-doelpunt-daryl-janmaat-psv-feyenoord-0-2.html |title=76' DOELPUNT DARYL JANMAAT, PSV – FEYENOORD, 0–2 |publisher=Fox Sports Netherlands |date=13 April 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adrian Joseph Mariappa''' (born 3 October 1986) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

He progressed through Watford's youth academy, and started playing for the first team in the [[2005–06 Watford F.C. season|2005–06 season]]. Although primarily a centre back, he spent some of his early professional career at right back due to competition for places in the middle. In his first spell at Watford, he made 247 first team appearances, including 19 in the [[Premier League]]. This included a run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth longest streak in Watford's history. Mariappa captained Watford at under-18, reserve and first-team levels, and was the club's vice captain in his final few years at [[Vicarage Road]]. Mariappa accepted his first call up to [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica's international team]] in May 2012.&lt;ref name=jamaica/&gt; He won his first cap against [[Guyana national football team|Guyana]] later that month, and transferred to [[Premier League]] side [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in July 2012. He made 29 league appearances for the club before joining Premier League side Crystal Palace in September 2013, following Reading's relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship.]]  Returning to Watford before the 2016–17 season, Mariappa made 7 league appearances that season.

'''Thomas William Cleverley''' (born 12 August 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Watford}} club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

After starting his career in the youth set-up at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], Cleverley joined Manchester United at the age of 12. Between 2007 and 2009 he played for Manchester United's reserve team, and occasionally in first-team [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly match]]es. Cleverley was [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the start of 2009, for whom he made his first [[English Football League|Football League]] appearances, helping the team secure the League One title and promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. He spent the [[2009–10 Watford F.C. season|2009–10 season]] on loan with Watford in the Championship, where he scored 11 goals in 33 league matches and was voted as their [[Watford F.C. Player of the Season|Player of the Season]]. On 31 August 2010, he joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on a season-long loan, where he scored four goals in 25 appearances and helped them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He returned to Manchester United for the start of the [[2011–12 Manchester United F.C. season|2011–12 season]] and made his first competitive appearance in the [[FA Community Shield]] victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He won the Premier League with Manchester United in 2013.

Cleverley played for [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]], and later that year made his debut for the [[England national football team|England national team]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Cleverley was born in [[Basingstoke]], Hampshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman2010-11/&gt; but grew up in [[Bradford]], West Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Dream debut for Tom |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Dream-debut-for-Tom.aspx |publisher=Manchester United |page=1 |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012214131/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Dream-debut-for-Tom.aspx |archivedate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Hanson School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Famous Students |url=http://www.hansonoldstudents.org/links/ |publisher=Hanson Old Students Association |accessdate=15 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City's]] youth set-up, but joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as an 11-year-old trainee in July 2000.&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Cleverley exclusive: Why I was right to leave Manchester United and Everton|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/25/tom-cleverley-exclusive-right-leave-manchester-united-everton/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005–06 season, he made nine appearances for the under-18 team.

'''Troy Matthew Deeney''' (born 29 June 1988) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for and captains {{English football updater|Watford}} club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

Deeney started his professional career at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. He spent a brief spell on loan with [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Premier Division club [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] during the 2006–07 season. He transferred to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club Watford in 2010 and captained the team to promotion to the Premier League in the [[2014–15 Watford F.C. season|2014–15 season]].

==Early and personal life==
Deeney was born in [[Birmingham]], West Midlands,&lt;ref name="Hugman2010–11"/&gt; and grew up in [[Chelmsley Wood]]. He was one of three children born to his parents, who split up when he was 11. He was expelled from school when he was 14, before returning at the age of 15. He left at 16 without any GCSEs and began training as a bricklayer, earning £120 a week.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/12965798.From_Chelmsley_Wood_to_the_Premier_League__Deeney_s_journey_is_different_to_most/ |title=Troy Deeney speaks to Frank Smith about how he went from scoring seven times whilst drunk for Chelmsley Wood to captaining Watford into the Premier League |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |date=23 May 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2012, Deeney was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for kicking a man in the head during a brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/9780737.Deeney_sentenced_to_ten_months_in_prison/ |title=Watford striker Troy Deeney sentenced to ten months in prison for affray. |newspaper=Watford Observer |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/903262-watford-striker-troy-deeney-jailed-for-ten-months-for-kicking-man-in-head |title=Watford striker Troy Deeney jailed for ten months for kicking man in head |newspaper=Metro |location=London |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after serving almost three months of the sentence, after showing his remorse, and the fact that he was a first-time offender. Since his release from prison in 2012, he has earned GCSEs in English, Science and Maths.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt;

Deeney is married and has a son, Myles, and a daughter, Amelia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/1166857/watford-star-troy-deeneys-summer-wishlist-includes-a-new-contract-a-trip-to-disneyworld-and-a-new-car-park-space/ |title=Watford star Troy Deeney's summer wishlist includes a new contract, a trip to DisneyWorld and a new car-park space |newspaper=The Sun |first=Wally |last=Downes Jr |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=14 October 2016 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Ellis, is a semi-professional footballer who plays as a [[central midfielder]]. Ellis started his career at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], where he was captain of their academy team before being released. He has played for [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]], [[Hinckley United F.C.|Hinckley United]] and [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] and now plays for [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]]. Ellis is a personal trainer, and Deeney helped fund his training in the profession.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt;

==Club career==
===Walsall===
Deeney was invited by the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] academy to take part in a four-day summer trial at the age of 15 with a view to earning a youth contract; however, he missed the first three days as he "knew there was a game on the last day" and was not offered terms by Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/29/watford-troy-deeney-aston-villa-remi-garde |title=Watford's Troy Deeney gloats over 'better than dream goal' at Aston Villa |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Peter |last=Lansley |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having joined [[Chelmsley Town F.C.|Chelmsley Town]], he was scouted by [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]'s Head of Youth Mick Halsall, who only attended the match Deeney was playing in because his son was also playing and due to the match he was scheduled to attend being postponed.{{fact|date=February 2019}} Deeney was playing while drunk,{{fact|date=February 2019}} but scored seven goals in an 11–4 win.{{fact|date=February 2019}} He was offered a trial by the then [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club, but only attended after his Chelmsley manager got him out of bed and paid for his taxi.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"/&gt; After signing for Walsall on 18 December 2006, Deeney was instantly sent out to [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] on loan for the rest of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name=Walsallprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saddlers.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10428~39532,00.html |title=Player profiles: Troy Deeney |accessdate=24 August 2010 |publisher=Walsall F.C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811093408/http://www.saddlers.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10428~39532,00.html |archivedate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first professional competitive goal for Walsall against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in a 2–1 win in September 2007.&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt; This turned out to be his only goal of the 2007–08 season, and the 2008–09 season started similarly, with him managing only two goals in the first half of the season. However, the introduction of [[Chris Hutchings]] as manager coincided with Deeney finding a goalscoring touch. Helped by the fact that his new manager started playing him in his favoured striking position, instead of on the right wing as the previous manager [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]] had, Deeney scored nine goals in Hutchings' first 12 matches in charge.&lt;ref name=Walsallprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt; On 9 September 2009, it was announced that Deeney had signed a new two-year deal until 2011.&lt;ref name=Walsallcontract&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/walsall/8245994.stm |title=Deeney pens new Saddlers contract |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009–10 season, Deeney scored 14 goals to finish as Walsall's top scorer and was awarded the club's Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8893741.stm |title=Watford sign striker Troy Deeney from Walsall |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
====2010–2012: Making the breakthrough====
On 4 August 2010, Deeney handed in a written transfer request amid interest from several Championship clubs. He had been told he was to leave Walsall earlier in the summer, and had slackened his pre-season training in protest at the club's hardline stance when trying to sell him.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; He signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] two days later for an initial fee of £250,000 rising up to £500,000 on a two-year contract that lifted his salary from £1,200 to £6,000 a week.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; On the same day Deeney signed for Watford, he played a part in their 3–2 win against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on the opening day of the season, coming on for [[Marvin Sordell]] in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8880936.stm |title=Norwich 2–3 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney found his poor pre-season meant he struggled for fitness in comparison to his new teammates.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"/&gt; He scored his first Watford goal against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the first round of the League Cup on 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/8936586.stm |title=Watford 1–2 Notts County |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney went on to make 40 appearances for Watford in his first season, scoring three goals from 20 starts, although he was mainly deployed on the wing by [[Malky Mackay]].&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt;

At the beginning of the [[2011–12 Watford F.C. season|2011–12 campaign]], Deeney initially found it hard to acquire a starting spot in the team as many of his early season matches saw him consigned to a bench role.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; He soon found his way into the starting eleven and amassed a total of 46 appearances under the management of [[Sean Dyche]] in his preferred position as striker.&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punditarena.com/football/english-football/playon/troy-deeney-leading-front/ |title=Troy Deeney: Leading From The Front |website=Pundit Arena |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney finished the season as Watford's top goalscorer with 12 goals in all competitions and also won the Goal of the Season Award for his goal against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2760211,00.html |title=2011/12 Awards: Goal Of The Season |publisher=Watford F.C. |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508075202/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2760211,00.html |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–2015: Prolific scoring form====
[[File:Deeney Cowie.jpg|thumb|upright|Deeney (left) playing for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in 2012]]

Deeney made his first appearance for Watford, after his release from prison, against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Vicarage Road]] on 22 September 2012. The match finished 2–2, with Deeney coming on in the second half and hitting the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19615300 |title=Watford 2–2 Bristol City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the next match against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 29 September, and scored the winner from a spot kick in the 3–2 away win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19684243 |title=Huddersfield 2–3 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a memorable double against his boyhood club, Birmingham City, as Watford ran out 4–0 winners on 16 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21448127 |title=Birmingham 0–4 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Deeney signed a new contract with Watford, keeping him at the club until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21714650 |title=Troy Deeney: Striker commits future to Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney netted another [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in a 4–0 win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 20 April 2013, taking his tally to 18 for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22133456 |title=Watford 4–0 Blackburn |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, he scored his 19th goal of the season in the next match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], scoring the first goal in an important 2–1 away win for Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22211936 |title=Leicester 1–2 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Jonathan |last=Jurejko |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2013, Watford faced [[Leicester City]] in the play-off semi-final second leg at Vicarage Road. In one of the most dramatic ends to a play-off match in history, Deeney scored a goal deep into injury time to qualify for the [[2013 Football League Championship play-off Final|Championship Play-off final]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]]. After [[Manuel Almunia]] saved a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taken by [[Anthony Knockaert]] and a rebound, Watford charged down to the other end, and Deeney lashed in the winning goal in the seventh minute of added time – an ecstatic Deeney [[Goal celebration|celebrated the goal]] by jumping into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/10052075/Watford-3-Leicester-City-1-agg-3-2-match-report.html |title=Watford 3 Leicester City 1 (agg 3–2): match report |first=Tom |last=Prentki |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring 20 goals in the 2012–13 season, Deeney scored the only goal as Watford beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 1–0 in the opening match of the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23474781 |title=Birmingham City 0–1 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 August 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later on 10 August, Deeney scored a hat-trick as Watford thrashed [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] 6–1 at Vicarage Road. In doing so, he became the first ''Hornets'' player to score a hat-trick in a match since [[Michael Chopra]] in 2003, and the first one to do so at Vicarage Road since [[David Connolly]] on 7 December 1996. It was also Deeney's first career hat-trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23558547 |title=Watford 6–1 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2013 |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ken Sema''' (born 30 September 1993) is a Swedish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] as a [[midfielder]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Sema got promoted to the [[IFK Norrköping]] first team as a 19-year old in 2013. However, he spent the entire season on loan to [[IF Sylvia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.se/sport/nio-ifk-spelare-i-sylvias-trupp-8472975.aspx|title=Nio IFK-spelare i Sylvias trupp|first=Ulf|last=Stråhle|date=3 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not get his contract renewed after it expired at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/sema-om-nobben-klart-jag-var-sur/|title=Sema om nobben: "Klart jag var sur"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2014, he signed for second tier team [[Ljungskile SK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohuslaningen.se/sport/fotboll/1.2842843-sema-och-bjorlund-klara|title=Sema och Björlund klara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Östersunds FK===
In January 2016, Sema signed for [[Östersunds FK]] in the [[Allsvenskan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.op.se/fotboll/allsvenskan/ken-sema-bekraftar-overgangen-till-ofk-jag-ar-klar|title=Ken Sema bekräftar övergången till ÖFK: "Jag är klar"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he would have his major breakthrough. Sema won the [[2016–17 Svenska Cupen]] with Östersund, assisting three of their four goals in the final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/1lByX/ostersund-vann-svenska-cupen|title=Östersund vann Svenska Cupen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later played a major role in their [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]] campaign. On 22 February 2018, Sema scored a goal in a 2–1 win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the round of 32. Despite this, Östersund were eliminated from the Europa League after losing 2–4 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Arsenal 1-2 Oestersunds FK - UEFA Europa League 2017/2018 Live | work = WhoScored.com | url = https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1250853/Live/Europe-UEFA-Europa-League-2017-2018-Arsenal-Oestersunds-FK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
On 4 July 2018, Östersunds FK chairman Daniel Kindberg revealed that Sema was close to signing for [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/16332898.watford-ostersund-confirm-ken-sema-transfer/|title=Ostersund confirm Sema's Watford switch|first=Harry| last=Gray|work=Watford Observer|date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Watford confirmed the signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official: Sema Signs On|url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/official-sema-signs|publisher=Watford F.C.|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In 2016, Sema was a part of the [[Sweden national under-23 football team|Sweden Olympic team]] that played in Brazil, and scored his first U23 goal in a match against [[South Korea national under-23 football team|South Korea Olympic]]. In January 2017, he debuted for the [[Sweden national football team|Sweden senior team]] in a friendly 6–0 win over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com//football/match/2017/jan/12/sweden-v-slovakia|title=Sweden 6 - 0 Slovakia - Football|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sema was an unused substitute in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|the two-legged playoff]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in November 2017, which Sweden won, and therefore qualified for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. Despite featuring in commercials with the rest of the Sweden squad before the World Cup, Sema was eventually left out of the World Cup squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/xREJLj/sveriges-trupp-till-fotbolls-vm|title=Sveriges trupp till fotbolls-VM 2018 – här är alla som får åka till Ryssland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotbollsvm/jag-kan-forsta-att-det-blir-lite-skevt/|title=Märkliga Ica-bilderna: "Har blivit reaktioner"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craig George Cathcart''' (born 6 February 1989) is a Northern Irish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]]. He has also captained his country's [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21 side]].

A product of the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] youth academy, Cathcart spent time on loan at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]], and English [[Football League Championship]] sides [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and Watford, before joining newly promoted [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in 2010. Cathcart returned to Watford in July 2014 on a permanent deal.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Belfast]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Cathcart was spotted playing football for [[Glengormley High School]] at the age of 14, and, despite being coveted by clubs like [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] upon winning the Northern Ireland Youth Player of the Year award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart tipped for the top |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/3028231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he began training at the Manchester United School of Excellence in Belfast. He signed trainee terms at Manchester United in July 2005, and turned professional on his 17th birthday in February 2006. Cathcart became a regular in the Manchester United Under-18s team, and was a member of the Under-17s team that played at the 2007 Northern Ireland Milk Cup, scoring the first goal in a 5–0 win over Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fitzmaurice hits four for Orchard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5231658.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006–07 season, he was made captain of the United youth team that reached the [[FA Youth Cup]] Final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Report: United 1 Boro 0 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=412217 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he missed both legs of the final, the first through selection for the first team and the second through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=FAYC: Liverpool 1 United 2 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=419944 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Youth Cup Final: Show your support |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=421878 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
On 19 March 2007, Cathcart received his first call-up to the Manchester United senior squad for the [[FA Cup]] Sixth Round replay with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathan |last=Mercer |title=Man Utd 1–0 Middlesbrough |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6461727.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an injury to [[Nemanja Vidić]], Cathcart was promoted to the first team squad as cover on 31 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Vidic injury blow confirmed |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=415856 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unused substitute in Manchester United's 7–1 win against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] less than two weeks later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Man Utd 7–1 Roma (agg 8–3) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6534975.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[FA Cup]] semi-final victory over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] a further four days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Watford 1–4 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6534697.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 2–0 Sheff Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6555231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation that this defensive injury crisis would lead to Cathcart making his senior debut ended when he suffered a season-ending knee injury during training after the match against Sheffield United. As a result, he also missed the second leg of the FA Youth Cup final; he had already missed the first leg due to his call-up to the senior squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Injuries continue to mount |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=421283 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his injury, Cathcart's performances in the club's youth teams earned him the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy#Players of the Year|Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award]] for the 2006–07 season.

===Loan to Antwerp===
At the start of the 2007–08 season, Cathcart was sent on a half-season loan to United's Belgian feeder club, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], to gain match experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Youngster heads to Antwerp |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=467176 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the Belgians on 22 September 2007, in a match against [[R.O.C. de Charleroi-Marchienne|OC Charleroi]]. The next game saw Cathcart score Antwerp's only goal of the game in a 4–1 loss to [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]]. He scored again in a match against [[A.F.C. Tubize|Tubize]], to earn a 1–1 draw, and also the Man of the Match award. He made a further nine appearances for "The Great Old", to bring his total to 13, before returning to Manchester United at the end of 2007.
Although he was not originally selected for the squad, Cathcart was briefly called up to the Manchester United first team for their tour of South Africa on 24 July 2008, and played the full 90 minutes in the team's 4–0 victory over [[Kaizer Chiefs FC|Kaizer Chiefs]] on 26 July, his first appearance for the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Boss hails Vodacom triumph |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6614705 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then came on as a 66th-minute substitute for [[Jonny Evans]] in a match against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in Nigeria the following day, before then coming on for [[Wes Brown]] at half-time in a friendly against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on 4 August.

===Loans to the Championship===
On 8 August 2008, in a search for first-team football, Cathcart joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], on loan until the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cart Before The Start |url=http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1361126,00.html |publisher=pafc.co.uk |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904111051/http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10364~1361126%2C00.html |archivedate=4 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later extended to the entire 2008–09 season, as Cathcart has quickly become a regular at Home Park. He scored his first Plymouth goal in their 3–1 defeat at home to Ipswich in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plymouth 1–3 Ipswich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7674398.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart returned to Manchester United at the end of the 2008–09 season and played in two pre-season friendlies for the reserve team before joining up with the first team for the [[Audi Cup]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart revels in senior start |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=6637023 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Nemanja Vidić]] suffered a calf strain in the warm-up before the semi-final against [[Boca Juniors]], Cathcart was promoted to the starting XI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Antonio aces Reds bow |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=6636983 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United won the match 2–1, with Cathcart giving a good performance, although he did head the ball against his own crossbar midway through the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boca Juniors 1 United 2 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={3165B97F-681E-4B39-BE53-94EC9521C3DA}&amp;newsid=6636981 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |page=3 |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart scored the opening goal in a 3–1 away win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C. Reserves and Academy|Bolton Wanderers]] in the first game of the [[2009–10 Premier Reserve League]] season on 24 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Reserves: Bolton 1 United 3 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6638312 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Cathcart was sought after by a number of [[Football League Championship|Championship]] sides, and Manchester United received a bid of £1.25m from a Championship side but United preferred a loan deal. [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] both showed an interest in the young defender, but he instead signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on loan until 4 January 2010, where he joined fellow Old Trafford teammate Tom Cleverley and Arsenal youngster Henri Lansbury on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart joins the Hornets |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1796407,00.html |work=watfordfc.com |publisher=Watford FC |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923193244/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10400~1796407%2C00.html |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackpool===
[[File:Craig Cathcart.jpg|thumb|150px|Cathcart playing for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in 2010]]
On 11 August 2010, Cathcart signed for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] for an undisclosed fee, after agreeing a three-year contract, with an option for a further year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackpool sign quartet ahead of Premier League debut |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackpool/8904013.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he made his debut as Blackpool marked their Premier League debut with a 4–0 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the [[DW Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Wigan 0–4 Blackpool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8904972.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in the Premier League with a powerful header against his former club, Manchester United, at [[Bloomfield Road]] on 25 January 2011; the 15th-minute goal opened the scoring for the match, but Blackpool went on to lose 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Blackpool 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9371173.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
On 24 June 2014, Cathcart agreed terms on a two-year deal with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] having been out-of-contract at Blackpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Craig Cathcart: Watford sign Blackpool defender|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27995525|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially became a Watford player on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFICIAL: Cathcart Returns|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140624-craig-cathcart-signs-for-watford-1668448.aspx|publisher=watfordfc.com|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=24 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628162920/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140624-craig-cathcart-signs-for-watford-1668448.aspx|archivedate=28 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart's first Watford appearance came as a substitute for [[Gabriel Tamaș]] against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] on 20 September 2014, scoring an equalising goal on his debut. He went on to become an integral part of the team and scored twice more as the club were promoted to the Premier League. Cathcart's impressive season did not go unnoticed, and he signed a new four-year deal on 2 July 2015.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/150702-cathcart-new-deal-watford-fc-2521600.aspx|title=OFFICIAL: New Contract For Cathcart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Cathcart has been involved with the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]] since Under-17 level, and was part of the team that attempted to [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite qualification|qualify]] for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2006 European Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NI Under-17 European hopes dashed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/4854680.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2006, still just 17 years old, Cathcart had been promoted to the [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Northern Ireland Under-21 team]], and was named in the squad for a friendly against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] on 14 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millar names squad for Germany |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6137482.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Cathcart was selected in the European squad for the [[2007 UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup|2007 Meridian Cup]], a competition between two "all-star" Under-18 teams from Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europe's Meridian squad selected |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridian/news/kind=1/newsid=509113.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 February 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219054347/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridian/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D509113.html |archivedate=19 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his first call-up, Cathcart has been a regular name in Northern Ireland Under-21 squads, and has so far made seven appearances for the team, the most recent being a 3–0 defeat by [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] on 5 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round=15084/match=300219/report=lu.html |title=Germany 3–0 Northern Ireland&amp;nbsp;– Lineups |accessdate=10 November 2008 |date=5 September 2008 |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101133837/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round%3D15084/match%3D300219/report%3Dlu.html |archivedate=1 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart was called up to the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] squad in May 2009, along with nine other uncapped players for the international [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 6 June.&lt;ref name="Irish League quintet in NI squad "&gt;{{cite news |title=Irish League quintet in NI squad |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8059221.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathcart made his full international debut in Northern Ireland's 1–0 win against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in Maribor on 3 September 2010. Playing out of position at left-back, due to an injury to [[Jonny Evans]], Cathcart put in a strong performance and set up the winning goal for [[Corry Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8958348.stm|title=Slovenia 0–1 Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watford player scored his second international goal in a 1–1 friendly draw away to [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in March 2016.

I thought he was the star of the subs. He looked comfortable. I don't think he gave the ball away and he made our equaliser. We are very pleased with him."&lt;ref name="frame"/&gt;

Hughes scored his first goal for the club in a 5–1 win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 1 September 2012.&lt;ref name="goal1"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby 5–1 Watford| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19378170| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes signed a new contract in October 2012, committing his future at the club until summer 2015.&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite web| title =Hughes Pens New Rams Deal| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/hughes-commits-to-the-rams-434969.aspx| publisher = Derby County F.C. | date = 20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes scored his second goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 10 November, scoring an equalising goal from 20 yards.&lt;ref name="goal2"&gt;{{cite web| title =Millwall 1–2 Derby| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20189961| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 10 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Hughes was linked with moves to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and Manchester City.&lt;ref name="nov12links"&gt;{{cite news | title =Derby County teenager Will Hughes attracts Premier League interest ahead of possible England debut| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9673363/Derby-County-teenager-Will-Hughes-attracts-Premier-League-interest-ahead-of-possible-England-debut.html| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Clough denied the rumours,&lt;ref name="nov12denial"&gt;{{cite web| title =No bids for promising Ram| url =http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/no-bids-promising-ram-185755004.html| publisher =Yahoo!

==Style of play==
Hughes has been described as a "flair player" who uses through balls and mazy runs to create space for teammates and beat opposition defences in attacking positions.&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby's Will Hughes – the Championship's latest sensation| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20769208| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes said in a December 2012 interview for the BBC, that he bases his play on Barcelona and [[Spain national football team|Spanish international]] central midfielders [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]].&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt; Hughes states his strengths are his passing and technical ability and targeted improvements in pace and physical strength.&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt;

Hughes' former England U21 coach [[Stuart Pearce]] described Hughes as "technically a very sound player". "He rarely gave the ball away in training or in the game he played [against Northern Ireland], which is vitally important at international level. He's progressing really well."&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt;

'''Francisco 'Kiko' Femenía Far''' ({{IPA-es|fɾanˈθisko femeˈni.a ˈfaɾ}}; born 2 February 1991) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

==Club career==
===Hércules===
Born in [[Sanet y Negrals]], [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]], [[Valencian Community]], Femenía was a product of [[Hércules CF]]'s youth ranks. He made his first-team debut on 15 June 2008 at just 17, appearing in a [[Segunda División]] match at [[Cádiz CF]], a 1–1 draw which eventually certified the [[Andalusia]]ns' [[2007–08 Segunda División|relegation]] even though they protested against the illegal fielding of an opposing player, specifically the youngster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol/confirmado-el-descenso-del-cadiz-a-segunda-b-5821759 Confirmado el descenso del Cádiz a Segunda B (Cádiz's relegation to ''Segunda B'' confirmed)]; [[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]], 4 July 2008 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008–09 Segunda División|2008–09 season]], Femenía played another game with the main squad, again in the last round but against [[UD Salamanca]] (5–1 away win).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2009/06/20/futbol/2adivision/1245525955.html El Hércules se despide a lo grande (Hércules say goodbye in style)]; [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], 20 June 2009 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent off-season, he signed his first professional contract after penning a five-year link&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laverdad.es/alicante/20090812/deportes_alicante/hercules/kiko-firmara-contrato-profesional-20090812.html Kiko firmará un contrato profesional por cinco temporadas con el Hércules (Kiko will sign five-year professional contract with Hércules)]; [[La Verdad (Murcia)|La Verdad]], 12 August 2009 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[2009–10 Segunda División|the following campaign]], still only 18, he would be a much more important midfield unit, being the first [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for veteran [[Francisco Rufete]] and appearing in nearly 1,000 minutes in the league to help the club return to [[La Liga]] after an absence of 13 years.

On 28 August 2010, Femenía made his debut in the top division, replacing [[Abel Aguilar]] in the second half of the home fixture against [[Athletic Bilbao]]: after only a few minutes on the pitch, however, and a couple of poor decisions, he suffered an [[Panic attack|anxiety attack]] from which he later fully recovered, although the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basques]] eventually won it 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elhercules.com/actualidad/59341-kiko-femenia-derrota-a-la-ansiedad Kiko Femenía derrota a la anxiedad (Kiko Femenía defeats anxiety)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907004503/http://elhercules.com/actualidad/59341-kiko-femenia-derrota-a-la-ansiedad|date=7 September 2010}}; El Hércules, 31 August 2010 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Femenía netted five times in 30 games – 23 starts – in [[2011–12 Segunda División|his first season]], helping the [[Catalonia|Catalans]] to the eighth position.

===Real Madrid===
In late August 2013, Femenía was released by Barcelona, stating that he had been "ruined emotionally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1537132/kiko-femenia-slams-barcelona-leaves-real-madrid?cc=5739 Madrid-bound Femenia slams Barcelona]; [[ESPN FC]], 29 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Just hours later, he signed for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], being assigned to [[Real Madrid Castilla|the reserves]] in the second level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130912114103/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/ActualidadCantera1314_en/News/1193040523950/1330157928677/noticia/Noticia/Kiko_Femenia,_new_Castilla_player.htm Kiko Femenia, new Castilla player]; Real Madrid C.F, 28 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Femenía appeared in only five matches during [[2013–14 Segunda División|the whole campaign]], which ended in relegation, and left the club in December 2014.

===Alcorcón===
On 7 January 2015, Femenía signed a six-month deal with [[AD Alcorcón]] also in the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adalcorcon.com/kiko-femenia-nuevo-futbolista-de-la-a-d-alcorcon/ Kiko Femenía, nuevo futbolista de la A.D.

'''José Lloyd Cholevas''' ({{lang-el|Χοσέ Λόιντ Χολέβας}}; born 27 June 1984), known as '''José Holebas''' {{IPA-el|xoˈse xoˈlevas|}}, is a Greek professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]] or a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|left midfielder]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He played for the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] from 2011 to 2016.

==Early life==
Holebas was born in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bavaria]], West Germany, to a [[Greeks|Greek]] father, Achilles, from [[Trikala]], and a [[Uruguay]]an mother, Lowis.

==Personal life==
At the age of 18, Holebas became father to daughter Tanisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/loewen-chance-3490728.bild.html | title = Holebas: Löwen sind die Chance meines Lebens! | trans-title = Holebas: "Lions are the chance of my life" | language = German | publisher = [[Bild]] | accessdate = 7 January 2015| date = 16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Holebas married Diana Jäger, a German woman who also hails from Aschaffenburg. Holebas speaks German and English fluently and although he does not speak much [[Greek language|Greek]], he understands it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.main-netz.de/nachrichten/region/aschaffenburg/aschaffenburg-stadt/berichte/art4011,1658747 | title = Erst der Titel in Griechenland, dann die Hochzeit in der Heimat | trans-title = First the championship in Greece, then the wedding at home | language = German | publisher = Main-Netz.de | accessdate = 7 January 2015| date = 24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early years===
Holebas' first club was local youth team Südring, which he joined in 1992 when he was eight. He played at non-professional youth football teams in German football which included playing for Südring, FC Kleinwallstadt and TSV Teutonia Obernau until 2001, when his girlfriend got pregnant and José, at age 18, decided to temporarily give up football. He had to work the double shift as a warehouse assistant in order to financially support his family. A year later, in 2002 and with the guidance of his Uruguayan uncle, Alfonso, whom Holebas described as his "second father" and "who gave me the kicks I needed to get my life back on track," helped him begin playing football again. He played for local youth side Aschaffenburg-Damm from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="pineza.gr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pineza.gr/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2908:ena-afierwma-sthn-apisteuth-zwi-tou-xose-xolempas&amp;Itemid=210 | title = Ένα αφιέρωμα στην απίστευτη ζωή του Χοσέ Χολέμπας | publisher = pineza.gr| date = 20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viktoria Kahl===
In 2005, Holebas was signed by German 6th-tier [[Landesliga Bayern-Nordwest]] club [[:de:FC Viktoria Kahl|FC Viktoria Kahl]]. Under manager Antonio Abbruzzese, he played as a striker and scored 15 goals in 33 appearances and finished among Landesliga's top scorers. [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] scouts approached him and Holebas joined their club in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thetoc.gr/athlitika/article/xose-xolebas-to-agori-me-ta-tatouaz| title = Χοσέ Χολέβας: Το αγόρι με τα τατουάζ| publisher = thetoc.gr| accessdate = 30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860 Munich===
[[File:Jose Holebas 1860 2009.JPG|thumb|left|150 px|Holebas training with 1860 Munich in 2009]]
In his first season in [[Munich]], Holebas was in 1860's [[TSV 1860 Munich II|second team]], where, at 22 years of age, he was considered "too old" by the club's youth academy coach, Ernst Tanner. Holebas officially made his debut for 1860 Munich II on 5 August 2006 in a [[Regionalliga Süd (1994–2012)|Regionalliga Süd]] game against [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]]. A year later, in the summer of 2007, Holebas signed his first professional contract with the [[TSV 1860 Munich|first team]]. He  made his professional debut for the "Munich Lions" on 21 September 2007 at 23 years of age against [[FC St. Pauli|St. Pauli]], in a [[2. Bundesliga]] game.

Holebas accumulated three years of professional football experience in the German second tier with 1860 Munich, with the side finishing 11th in 2007–08, 12th in 2008–09 (while also dropping back to 1860 Munich II for a number of games) and 8th in 2009–10. In the summer of 2009,  new coach [[Ewald Lienen]], advised  25-year-old Holebas to stay back and play as a defending left-winger.

Holebas finished his five-season stint in Germany with both Viktoria Kahl and 1860 Munich, scoring a total of 34 goals in 154 games in all competitions. Despite initially disliking the club as a child due to being a childhood fan of 1860's fierce cross-city [[Munich derby|Munich rivals]] [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern]], Holebas stated his changed opinion of the club that gave him his breakthrough in professional football, stating, "I'll forever be grateful to 1860 Munich."&lt;ref name="pineza.gr"/&gt;

===Olympiacos===
====2010–11 season====
Ewald Lienen left 1860 Munich to become the coach of [[Superleague Greece]] club [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. Lienen signed Holebas for a transfer fee of €500,000. Holebas stated in an interview, "My father is Greek, but this is only the second time that I have come back to the country. When I was [here] first here, I was very young and do not remember many things, but I must say that I am very happy to play in the old country."

On 15 July 2010, Holebas made his debut for Olympiacos in a 5–0 away victory over [[Albania]]n club [[Besa Kavajë]] in the first leg of a [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League second qualifying round]] tie. On 5 August, Olympiacos were knocked out of the [[UEFA Europa League]] by Israeli club [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], on the [[away goals rule]] and after a 2–2 draw. Olympiacos sacked Lienen; the new coach, [[Ernesto Valverde]], began to use Holebas both as a defending and an attacking left winger, depending on Olympiacos' opponent. Holebas scored his first goal for the club on 20 March 2011 in a 6–0 home league win over [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], which sealed the club's 38th Greek championship title.

====2011–12 season====
On 19 October 2011, Holebas opened the score  with a  header against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in a 3–1 home victory on matchday 3 of the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage|Champions League group stage]]. On 3 March 2012, Holebas scored his second goal of the season in a 2–0 away league victory over [[OFI Crete F.C.|OFI Crete]], a goal that won the Superleague goal of the week award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-fm.gr/videos/1024134 OΦΗ-Ολυμπιακός 0–2]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March, the next week, Holebas scored Olympiacos' second goal from the penalty spot in a 3–0 league away win over [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]]. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for their second season in a row,  winning their 39th Greek Championship title. On 28 April, Holebas started the [[2011–12 Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup Final]] against [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], where he missed a penalty kick in the first-half. Nonetheless, Olympiacos went on to win the Cup 2–1 after extra time, at the [[Spiros Louis Olympic Stadium|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. Holebas in the [[2011–12 Olympiacos F.C. season|2011–12 season]] scored 3 goals in 35 games in all competitions.

====2012–13 season====
On 23 September 2012, Holebas netted his first goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal in a 4–1 home league win over [[Panthrakikos F.C.|Panthrakikos]]. On 7 October, Holebas scored his second goal of the season by netting Olympiacos' first and only goal of the game in a 1–0 league home win over [[Asteras Tripoli F.C.|Asteras Tripoli]]. The next week, Holebas scored his third goal of the season by scoring the second goal in a 4–0 home league win over [[Skoda Xanthi F.C.|Skoda Xanthi]]. On 29 October, Holebas scored his fourth goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal and second equalizer in a 2–2 away league draw against Aris. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for a third season in a row, their 40th Greek Championship title.

On 11 May 2013, Holebas started and played in the Greek Cup final, where Olympiacos went on to retain the cup for a second season in a row with a 3–1 victory after extra time over Asteras Tripoli with goals from [[David Fuster]], Rafik Djebbour and [[Djamel Abdoun]] at the Athens Olympic Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/sports/article/?aid=512253 Το κύπελλο στον Ολυμπιακό, οργή στον Αστέρα για τη διαιτησία]&lt;/ref&gt; Holebas the [[2012–13 Olympiacos F.C. season|2012–13 season]] scoring four goals in 40 games in all competitions, winning another league and cup double.

====2013–14 season====
In the summer of 2013, there were rumours that Holebas would join Turkish club [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]], according to the Turkish media, which reported that he had agreed to sign a deal with the Black Eagles. The Turks reportedly offered the 29-year-old defender a three-year contract, with an annual salary reaching €750,000, a significant pay rise than what he was being paid by Olympiacos. The deal, however, was not completed, and Holebas decided to stay in Piraeus, subsequently signing a contract extension lasting until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eu.greekreporter.com/2013/08/09/holebas-from-olympiacos-to-besiktas/ | title = Holebas From Olympiacos To Besiktas?| publisher = greekreporter.com| date = 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2013, Holebas scored his first goal of the season by netting Olympiacos's third goal with a wonderful free-kick in a 5–1 league home win over OFI Crete. On 18 January 2014, he scored his second goal of the season by netting their second goal in a 2–0 home league win over [[Levadiakos F.C.|Levadiakos]]. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title again for a fourth season in a row by winning their 41st Greek championship. He finished the [[2013–14 Olympiacos F.C. season|2013–14 campaign]] scoring two goals in 29 games in all competitions and winning another League title.

Holebas finished his very successful four-season stint with Olympiacos by netting ten toal goals in 135 games in all competitions, and also by winning the Superleague Greece four times in 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013–14; the Greek Cup twice and in a row in 2011–12 and 2012–13; and participating in both the Champions League and Europa League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sud.worldfootball.net/spieler_profil/jose-holebas/ | title = José Holebas | publisher = worldfootball.net | accessdate = 1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roma===

On 30 August 2014, Holebas joined [[Serie A]] club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for a €1 million transfer fee from Olympiacos, plus €500,000 in bonuses. He signed a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2014/08/31/5072331/roma-sign-jose-holebas|title =Roma sign Jose Holebas|publisher=www.goal.com|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being presented to the media in [[Rome]] by Roma [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Italo Zanzi]], Holebas stated why he joined Roma in a press conference: "I had other offers, but I decided on Roma because they are a great club at a European level. Was I expecting this move? I had discussions, it was a difficult situation because I was at the World Cup, but I am happy to be here because this is a great club. My preferred position? Certainly I will do my best. I am a left-back, playing in an attacking manner. I can also play at centre-back, but the Coach will decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.football-italia.net/55152/official-roma-sign-holebas|title =Official: Roma sign Holebas|publisher=football-italia.net|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2014, Holebas made his debut for the club, by playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 away league victory over [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in their fourth match of the [[2014–15 Serie A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29311571|title =Parma 1-  Roma 2 |publisher=www.bbc.com|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November, Holebas scored his first goal for Roma in an important 4–2 home victory over [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in their 13th match of Serie A to stay in touch with the top of the table. He finished his [[2014–15 A.S. Roma season|2014–15 season]] scoring one goal in 34 games in all competitions, whilst keeping veteran English international left back [[Ashley Cole]] out of the team for much of the season. For the second season in a row, Roma finished runners-up to league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], marking for the first time since the 2009–10 season that  Holebas did not win any piece of silverware.

====Transfer speculation and controversy====
On 25 June 2015, it was reported that recently promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] were close to securing a deal for Holebas after the side confirmed interest by contacting the Italians and admiring the player's profile; they allegedly offered between €2–3 million for his services. At that point, there was a summit at Trigoria between Roma Sporting Director [[Walter Sabatini]] and the entire staff, including head coach [[Rudi Garcia]] and Simone Beccaccioli. Talks between the two clubs continued, where it was growing likely that the deal would officially be announced the following Monday. Fabio Parisi, Holebas' agent, spoke to VoceGiallorossa about the situation: "Nothing is done. There is confirmation of Watford’s interest, but there is absolutely nothing done. For now, the player's will is to have a holiday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romapress.us/2015/06/26/sky-italia-holebas-a-step-away-from-watford-move/|title=Sky Italia: Holebas a step away from Watford move|publisher=romapress.us|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July, Watford officially announced the signing of the Greek international from Roma, which Holebas denied when he found out 24 hours later after the announcement, claiming he did not know anything about it. He later stated in an interview, "They arranged my transfer without asking me. I haven't signed anything yet, I have to see the contract first. I don't know why this has happened, I know that both Roma and Watford announced my transfer, but they'd have to talk to my representatives first. I never said I wanted to leave Roma. I'll sign after first agreeing to the terms of the contract. I can't understand why this has happened, I came back from my holiday in [[Dubai]] and everyone started telling me my transfer had been officially announced. I'm in Germany right now, how could I sign a contract?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/jose-holebas-denies-signing-for-watford-24-hours-after-club-announce-his-arrival-10364930.html|title=Jose Holebas denies signing for Watford, 24 hours after club announce his arrival|publisher=www.standard.co.uk|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following that claim, and after days of confusion and wondering if Holebas was going to either continue his contact and talks with Watford and eventually sign for them, or if he was going to turn his back on Watford's offer to stay committed to the three-year deal he signed at Roma a year earlier, it was reported that on 5 July that Holebas had decided to revive his contact and discussions with Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/68746/holebas-revives-watford-talks|title=Holebas revives Watford talks|publisher=www.football-italia.net|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
Watford eventually officially completed the signing of Holebas for an initial fee of £1.8 million, which Roma confirmed. Roma also announced on their official website that the move could also include up to £350,000 worth of add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3147564/Watford-agree-signing-Roma-defender-Jose-Holebas-1-8million-deal.html|title=Watford agree signing of Roma defender Jose Holebas in £1.8million deal|publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 8 August 2015, he made his debut for the club, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–2 away league draw against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in their opening [[2015–16 Premier League]] match and Watford's return to the top division. He picked up a yellow card in the match.

Playing just three games in all competitions in the first two-and-a-half months of the season, he  struggled to secure a first place spot in the Watford side, sitting third in the pecking order behind [[Nathan Aké]] and [[Ikechi Anya]] for the starting left-back spot. As a result, rumours circulated that he could be off-loaded already in the January transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/watford-ready-ditch-greek-international-6553963|title=Watford ready to ditch Greek international defender Jose Holebas – after just THREE GAMES|publisher=www.mirror.co.uk|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clubcall.com/watford/holebas-heading-for-january-exit-1783511.html|title=Holebas heading for January exit|publisher=www.clubcall.com|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornets manager [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] insisted that Holebas needed to improve to return to the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3256089/Watford-defender-Jose-Holebas-needs-improve-win-team-spot-insists-Quique-Sanchez-Flores.html|title=Watford defender Jose Holebas needs to improve to win back his first-team spot, insists Quique Sanchez Flores|publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three months of not playing, Holebas returned to the side on 26 December to play the full 90 minutes in a  2–2 league draw away against reigning league champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], picking up a yellow card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35139930|title=BBC Sport – Chelsea 2–2 Watford|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2016, reports surfaced that French [[Ligue 1]] giants [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] were keen on signing Holebas, and that their head coach [[Míchel (footballer)|Míchel]] was seeking to rekindle the relationship that he and Holebas formed whilst working together for a season-and-a-half at Olympiacos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/watford-transfer-news-jose-holebas-attracting-interest-from-marseille-a3150956.html|title=Watford transfer news: Jose Holebas attracting interest from Marseille|publisher=www.standard.co.uk|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March, Holebas complained on social media after being dropped for Aké in a game against Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdsport.co.uk/2016/02/jose-holebas-im-sick-of-this-s/ |title=Jose Holebas: "I’m sick of this s***" |publisher=www.wdsport.co.uk |date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2016, radio station ''Radyospor'' reported that Holebas had been offered to Turkish giants [[Fenerbahçe S.K.

It was later given as a Seamus Coleman own goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/watford-vs-everton/2043531/report |title=Watford vs Everton 1–1 |publisher=www.goal.com |date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2016, Holebas scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 comeback away victory against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37263970|title=West Ham United 2–4 Watford |publisher=www.bbc.com|date=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October, he scored the only goal of an away win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37599407|title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Watford – BBC Sport|publisher=www.bbc.com|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Holebas signed a new deal to keep him at Vicarage Road until the summer of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42612600 |title=Jose Holebas: Watford left-back signs new contract until 2020 |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |date=8 January 2018 |accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2018, Holebas scored with a lovely touch inside [[Andros Townsend]], looked up, and whipped in a cross that dips and swerved over [[Wayne Hennessey]] and into the top corner, giving his club a two-goal lead in a 2–1 home win game against [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] It was his first goal for the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/watford-vs-c-palace/390785 |title=Watford 2–1 Crystal Palace: Roberto Pereyra, Jose Holebas seal third straight win |publisher=www.skysports.com |date=26 August 2018 |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2018, Holebas helped his club to maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season, continued to display excellent understanding down the left flank by giving two brilliant assists to [[Troy Deeney]] and [[Craig Cathcart]] in a 2–1 home win game against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/sep/02/watford-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live |title=Watford 2–1 Tottenham |publisher=www.theguardian.com |date=2 September 2018 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2018, he scored his second goal in the [[2018–19 Premier League|2018–19 season]] in a 1–1 away draw against [[Southampton F.C.]] rescued a point for Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2018/11/10/49257692/southampton-1-watford-1-holebas-cranks-up-pressure-on-hugbes |title=Southampton 1 Watford 1: Holebas cranks up pressure on Hugbes |publisher=www.goal.com |date=10 November 2018 |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2018, he curled in a beautiful left-footed strike from the edge of the box, giving a two-goal lead in a 3–2 home win game against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.watfordfc.com/matches/match-review/match-review-watford-3-2-cardiff-city |title=Watford vs Cardiff 3-2|publisher=www.watfordfc.com |date=15 December 2018 |accessdate=15 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20130814 AT-GR Nationalteam Griechenland 2414.JPG|thumb|300px|Holebas (second from bottom left) lining up for Greece against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in August 2013]]

Holebas being born in [[West Germany]] was eligible to represent [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and through his [[Greeks|Greek]]-[[Uruguayans|Uruguayan]] heritage was also eligible to represent [[Greece national football team|Greece]] or [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in international football. He never appeared for any of the countries at youth level. In an interview about his International ambitions with a Greek reporter, he stated, "My dream growing up was to play for Germany, but my father is Greek so I would be happy to play for Greece." In November 2011, he received Greek citizenship as "Iosif Cholevas," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/o_holebas_egine_xolevas.1428931.html|publisher=sport24.gr|title=Ο Holebas έγινε Χολέβας!|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the 11th of the same month, he officially made his debut for Greece in a friendly match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]], which ended in a 1–1 draw at the [[Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]].

[[File:20130814 AT-GR Jose Holebas 2825.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Holebas playing for Greece against Austria in 2013]]

In 2012, Holebas was part of Greece's 23-man squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] finals held in [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. He started the first two group games against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in a 1–1 draw and against [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in a 2–1 loss and was dropped for the third match due to heavy criticism that his attacking tendency was becoming hazardous to the usually-solid defensive tactics of Greece. Nonetheless, he did come on for the final 30 minutes of the match, playing admirably and assisting Greece in holding on to the 1–0 win against Russia, which took them to the quarter-finals. Here, however, Greece fell to Germany by a score of 4–2, a defeat in which Holebas picked up a suspension for receiving another yellow card after his previous booking in the game against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/01/world-cup-2014-greece-jose-holebas | title = World Cup 2014: Greece profile&amp;nbsp;– José Holebas| publisher = theguardian.com| date = 20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holebas scored his first international goal for Greece in a 1–0 victory against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in November 2012, a friendly match played at the [[Aviva Stadium]] in [[Dublin]].

Holebas' impressive 2013–14 season with Olympiacos prompted his nomination from Greek manager [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] as a part of the final 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Brazil]]. He played in all of Greece's matches, which included a 3–0 loss to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], a 0–0 draw with [[Japan national football team|Japan]], a 2–1 victory over [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in the Group Stages, and the 1–1 (5–3 penalty shoot-out) defeat to [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in the last 16, during which he converted his penalty kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/greece/10810255/Greece-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|title=Greece World Cup 2014 squad|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2015, two days before the crucial [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification|Euro 2016 qualifier]] for Greece against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], media reports claimed that Holebas had trained normally with his Roma squad after departing from Austria on Tuesday. "On Monday José underwent a radiographic examination of which it was diagnosed that he was suffering from a left rib case injury. The player trained in [[Austria]] under an individual program but was not fit to be available to play against Hungary," the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] (HFF) said in an announcement. The HFF added that reports out of Italy cited by the Greek media "lead to completely erroneous conclusions in regards to the willingness of the player to contribute to his commitments with the national team any further."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/football/greek-football-federation-backs-injured-jose-holebas_1568865.html|publisher=zeenews.india.com|title=Greek football federation backs injured Jose Holebas|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably the cause for the non-call-up of the player for the national team, creating tension with new Greek manager and former national team teammate [[Georgios Karagounis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/National-Greece/holebas-ethniki-greece-hellas-karagounis-roma.3515713.html|publisher=www.contra.gr|title=Χολέμπας στο Contra.gr: "Γελοία αντίδραση το κόψιμό μου"|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 2015, Holebas returned to the national side after being picked by caretaker coach [[Kostas Tsanas]], where he appeared for Greece for the first time in 12 months in Greece's 0–1 home defeat against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Piraeus. The defeat officially ended Greece's hopes of qualification to the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] in [[France]] in a poor overall qualifying campaign for Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013983/index.html|title=Greece 0–1 Finland|publisher=www.uefa.com|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Holebas played his 38th and last ever cap for Greece when he came on as a second-half substitute in the Greek 2–0 home win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] on 7 October 2016 in Piraeus. Then on 10 October 2016, after a 2–0 away win against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Holebas officially announced his decision to retire from International football because he feels that it is time for the younger footballers of Greece to step up and become Greek international regulars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1158132/apoxorei-apo-tin-ethniki-o-xolempas |title=Αποχωρεί από την Εθνική ο Χολέμπας! |publisher=www.naftemporiki.gr |date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However on 1 September 2017, Holebas admitted he had left the Greek national team due to his dislike of national team coach [[Michael Skibbe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/National-Greece/o-xolempas-adeiase-skimpe-gia-tis-epiloges-paiktwn-sthn-ethnikh.4747512.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereyra is right-footed and plays as a [[midfielder]] but can also play as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. Due to his versatility, he is capable of playing a variety of positions such as a left or right [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]],  a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or even as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]].&lt;ref name="Roberto Pereyra, nuovi Zanetti crescono"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciosudamericano.it/roberto-pereyra-nuovi-zanetti-crescono/|title=Roberto Pereyra, nuovi Zanetti crescono...|trans-title=Roberto Pereyra, new Zanettis are developing...|publisher=Calcio Sudamericano|author1=Andrea Bracco|language=Italian|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beginning his career in Argentina with [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], he joined Italian club [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in 2011, where his performances earned him a loan to defending league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2014; he was signed permanently by the team in 2015 and won two consecutive [[Serie A]] titles during his time with the club. During his time in Italy, he developed into a well-rounded, adaptable, and tactically versatile player due to his dynamism, energy, and technique, as well as his offensive and defensive work-rate and attributes.&lt;ref name="Pereyra, dinamismo e duttilità"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/it/news/pereyra%20dinamismo%20e%20duttilita|title=Pereyra, dinamismo e duttilità|trans-title=Pereyra, dynamism and versatility|publisher=Juventus|language=Italian|date=25 July 2015|accessdate=11 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613020935/http://www.juventus.com/juve/it/news/pereyra%20dinamismo%20e%20duttilita|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he joined Watford.

===Udinese Calcio===
Officially signing for [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] 30 August 2011, Pereyra signed a five-year contract with the Friuli outfit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udinese.it/ENG/script/view.php?id=815 |title=Pereyra Declares...Welcome Roberto! |publisher=[[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] |accessdate=31 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929153023/http://www.udinese.it/ENG/script/view.php?id=815 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make 15 appearances in all competitions during his debut season in [[Italy]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Walthamstow]], London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Glenda|editor1-last=Rollin|editor2-first=Jack|editor2-last=Rollin|title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2012–2013|year=2012|publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group|Headline]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7553-6356-8|page=547|edition=43rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoban grew up in the [[Chingford]] and [[Woodford Green]] area. He joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] youth system at the age of 7 and was released at 14. Following his release eight clubs expressed an interest in Hoban, and from them he and his family selected [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] based on location and the recommendation of an Arsenal coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/10170051._/?|title=Watford defender Tommie Hoban believes his release by Arsenal was a blessing in disguise|date=20 January 2013|author=Frank Smith|publisher=''Watford Observer''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoban made his senior debut for Watford on 7 May 2011, in their final game of the [[2010–11 Watford F.C. season|2010–11 season]] against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] coming on for [[Martin Taylor (footballer born 1979)|Martin Taylor]] in the first half.&lt;ref name = "2010-11"/&gt; He turned professional three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/9017617.Hoban_latest_scholar_handed_deal/|title=Watford first-year scholar Tommie Hoban latest academy product to sign pro deal|date=10 May 2011|author=Frank Smith|publisher=''Watford Observer''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following "rave reviews" in the Championship during the [[2012–13 Watford F.C. season|2012–13 season]], Hoban received attention from a number of Premiership clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tommie-hoban-rocking-but-he-wont-let-big-guns-knock-him-off-course-8438170.html|title=Tommie Hoban rocking but he won't let big guns knock him off course|date=4 January 2013|author=Giuseppe Muro|publisher=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Hoban picked up an ankle injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/10229968.Hoban_a_doubt_for_Birmingham_clash/|title=Watford defender Tommie Hoban a doubt for Birmingham City clash after suffering a recurrence of an ankle problem|date=14 February 2013|publisher=Watford Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Amsterdam]] of [[Suriname]]se descent, Zeegelaar finished his formation with local [[AFC Ajax]].

In the summer, he signed a four-year contract with [[RCD Espanyol]] in Spain, being assigned to [[RCD Espanyol B|the B-team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/202082/Aanvaller-Zeegelaar-verruilt-Ajax-voor-Espanyol-B.htm|title=Aanvaller Zeegelaar verruilt Ajax voor Espanyol B|trans-title=Defender Zeegelaar swaps Ajax for Espanyol B|publisher=[[Voetbal International]]|language=nl|date=2011|accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Zeegelaar joined [[Süper Lig]] side [[Elazığspor]]. In September of the following year, he moved to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/news/article/zeegelaar-arrives-on-loan-1032672.aspx|title=Zeegelaar arrives on loan|publisher=Blackpool F.C|date=3 September 2013|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut in the competition on 21 September, playing the second half of the 1–2 home loss to [[F.C. Arouca]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/jogo/rio-ave-vs-arouca-89780|title=Rio Ave 1–2 Arouca|publisher=[[SAPO (company)|SAPO]]|language=pt|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he finished [[2014–15 Primeira Liga|his first season]] with 25 matches and one goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.ao/futebol/primeira-liga/artigos/rio-ave-e-nacional-empatam|title=Rio Ave e Nacional empatam|trans-title=Rio Ave and Nacional draw|publisher=SAPO|language=pt|date=9 March 2015|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to a final tenth position.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
====Academy====
Liverpool signed Sinclair as a 14-year-old from the [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] youth academy in the summer of 2011&lt;!-- after refusing to extend his his scholarship terms with West Bromwich following interest from the Merseyside team *** not in cited source ***--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9567196/Liverpool-teenager-Jerome-Sinclair-set-to-become-clubs-youngest-ever-player-aged-16-years-and-six-days.html |title=Liverpool teenager Jerome Sinclair set to become club's youngest ever player aged 16 years and six days |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liverpool staff compared him to [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A258058424/GPS?sid=wikipedia |title=Ciss is one for Kenny |newspaper=The People |location=London |date=5 June 2011 |page=54 |accessdate=2 February 2017 |via=Infotrac Newsstand |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of the 2011–12 season with the Under-16s before coach [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] gave him a run of four games with the Under-18s at the end of the season. He impressed greatly in those games, though he failed to find the back of the net. On 14 July 2012, Sinclair came off the bench to score a hat trick against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in an Under-18s pre-season friendly. In all, Sinclair netted eight goals in the six Under-18s pre-season friendly games in the run up to the 2012–13 Academy Under 18s season. He went on to score his first competitive goals for the Under-18s on 25 August 2012, hitting a brace in a 3–3 draw with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====Reserves and first-team debut====
While still only 15, Sinclair was called up to Rodolfo Borrell's [[NextGen Series (2011–13)|NextGen Series]] side for the away match with defending champions [[Inter Milan]] in September 2012, after first-team manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] included a number of young players in his [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] squad. He started the match and performed well, winning a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that [[Krisztián Adorján]] converted and going close himself on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/liverpool-inter-milan-nextgen-jerome-sinclair-krisztian-386290 |title=Liverpool youngsters edged out by NextGen champions Inter Milan |first=Adrian |last=Back |newspaper=International Business Times |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers called Sinclair up to the first team for the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] third-round tie away to his boyhood club, West Bromwich Albion, on 26 September. At the age of 16 years and 6 days, he came off the bench in the 81st minute to replace [[Samed Yeşil]] in the 2–1 win at [[The Hawthorns]], thus breaking [[Jack Robinson (footballer born 1993)|Jack Robinson]]'s record as Liverpool's youngest ever player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645199 |title=West Brom 1–2 Liverpool |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the [[2012–13 Liverpool F.C. season|2012–13 season]] Sinclair continued to play for Liverpool U18s, but his 2013–14 season was disrupted by injury.&lt;ref name=ChelseaU21&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-u21s-2-0-chelsea-8756434 |title=Liverpool FC U21s 2–0 Chelsea U21s: Jerome Sinclair could be next Academy graduate heading to first team and Sergi Canos' form going from strength to strength – five things we learned |first=Andy |last=Kelly |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the beginning of March 2015, Sinclair scored 22 goals for Liverpool youth teams at various levels,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} including 6 goals in 7 [[2014–15 UEFA Youth League|UEFA Youth League]] games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/clubs/club=2606417/index.html |title=UEFA Youth League: Liverpool FC |publisher=UEFA |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an impressive finish against [[Manchester United F.C.

On 16 March 2015, Sinclair was loaned to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], where he linked up with academy teammate [[Sheyi Ojo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/181788-sinclair-joins-wigan-on-youth-loan-deal |title=Sinclair joins Wigan on youth loan deal |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he made his [[Football League]] debut in what proved to be his only Wigan appearance, replacing [[Marc-Antoine Fortuné]] for the final eight minutes of a 2–0 loss to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at the [[DW Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31809691 |title=Wigan 0–2 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Liverpool, Sinclair made his [[Premier League]] debut as a 68th-minute substitute for [[Rickie Lambert]] in a 1–1 draw away to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 10 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32571658 |title=Chelsea 1–1 Liverpool |first=Marc |last=Higginson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first appearance of the 2015–16 season, away to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 8 January 2016, Sinclair scored his first senior goal for Liverpool in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35155398 |title=Exeter City 2–2 Liverpool |first=Gary |last=Rose |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later he confirmed that he would leave Liverpool at the end of the season, suggesting he wanted to play in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35342040 |title=Jerome Sinclair: Liverpool youngster to leave the club |first=Simon |last=Stone |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, an offer from [[AFC Bournemouth]] of £4&amp;nbsp;million plus add-ons was accepted by the club but rejected by the player.&lt;ref name=AFCBbid&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-hope-jerome-sinclair-tribunal-11372756 |title=Liverpool hope for Sinclair tribunal windfall |first=Neil |last=Jones |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
In the January 2016 transfer window, Liverpool had rejected an offer of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million for Sinclair from Premier League club Watford.

'''Stefano Chuka Okaka''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsteːfano oˈkaːka}}; born 9 August 1989) is an Italian [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on loan from English club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

==Club career==
===Roma===
Born in [[Castiglione del Lago]], Umbria, Italy to [[Nigeria]]n parents who later obtained Italian citizenship, Okaka joined the [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] youth system in 2004. He was part of the team that won the [[Trofeo Giacinto Facchetti|U-20 national title]] in 2005 and scored goals against Juventus in the semi-final and Atalanta in the final.

On 29 September 2005, he made his debut with the first team in the [[UEFA Cup]], playing against [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]]. He thus became the youngest footballer to debut in an international competition for an Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://it.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=2005/round=2208/match=81841/index.html|publisher=UEFA.com|language=Italian|title=Roma in scioltezza|accessdate=15 January 2008|date=29 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okaka scored his first official goal for Roma in a [[Coppa Italia]] match against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] on 8 December 2005, with a powerful run from midfield and a precise shot to the left of the goalkeeper, making him the youngest goalscorer in the competition.&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"/&gt; He made his [[Serie A]] debut with the club later that month, on 18 December 2005, at the age of 16 years and 125 days, in a 1–1 away draw against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/sport/cards/i-piu-giovani-esordire-serie-a/stefano-okaka.shtml|title=I più giovani a esordire in Serie A Pellegri come Amadei quando la carriera inizia a 15 anni|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|author1=Fiorenzo Radogna|date=21 November 2016|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/speciali/statistiche/2006/giocatori/presenze_okaka_chuka_ste.shtml|title=Stefano OKAKA CHUKA|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several more appearances for the senior squad, scoring his first [[Serie A]] goal nine months later, on 17 September 2006, the last of three Roma goals in a 3–1 win over [[A.C. Siena|Siena]], just 38 days after his 17th birthday, after coming on as a substitute for [[Francesco Totti]]. He also made his debut in the [[UEFA Champions League]] later that month, in a 2–1 away loss to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], on 27 September.&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/sampdoria/story/2036404/stefano-okaka-could-be-top-italy-striker-says-sampdoria-coach-sinisa-mihajlovic|title=Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Ben Gladwell|date=15 September 2014|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently loaned to [[Serie B]] side [[Modena F.C.|Modena]] for the [[2007–08 Serie B|2007–08 season]] in order to gain some first team experience. Okaka had a fairly good season at Modena, scoring seven times in 33 appearances.

After returning to Roma, he signed a new contract which lasted until 30 June 2012. As a part of it, he earned a gross annual salary of €0.6M in the first two seasons, which then increased to €0.7M and €0.9M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asroma.it/NewsDoc.aspx?Categoria=ITComunicatiFinanziari&amp;Documento=9547|title=Prolungato il contratto economico per le prestazioni sportive di Stefano Okapa|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=18 June 2010|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent a six-month loan period at [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] in Serie B from January to June 2009, where he scored two goals in 16 appearances.

On August 2009, he scored his first goal with Roma in a continental competition, the final goal in a 7–1 result defeat of [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] in the second leg of the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]] third qualifying round. He scored again in the Europa League in Roma's 2–0 win over [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] and in Roma's 2–1 win over Fulham. His last goal with Roma was an 88th-minute winner against Siena.

On 1 February 2010, he joined Fulham on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut for Fulham in the 1–0 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 3 February 2010. He scored his first goal for the club on 14 February 2010 in a 5th round [[FA Cup]] tie at home to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2011 he moved to [[F.C. Bari 1908|Bari]] on loan. There, he scored his first goal against [[US Lecce|Lecce]] for 1–0 win. In this game he and [[Kamil Glik]] marking their debuts for Bari. He scored one further goal for Bari that season. Okaka sustained an injury in round 30 and missed the rest of the season.

In August 2011, Okaka was attacked by Roma fans after a training session for allegedly not wishing to sign autographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landolina|first1=Salvatore|title=Roma Condemn Fan Attacks On Ahmed Barusso &amp; Stefano Okaka|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2176/serie-a/2011/08/10/2614011/roma-condemn-fan-attacks-on-ahmed-barusso-stefano-okaka|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Goal|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to make a single appearance for Roma in the first half of the season, on 22 January 2012, he joined [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coerts|first1=Stefan|title=Official: Parma sign Roma's Stefano Okaka on loan|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2012/01/22/2860468/official-parma-sign-romas-stefano-okaka-on-loan|publisher=Goal|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first Parma goal on 7 March 2012, the opener in a 2–2 against Fiorentina. He netted his second goal on 21 April from the spot against Cesena. He scored his third against Palermo four days later.

===Parma===
Having returned to Roma at the end of the season Okaka signed a permanent deal with Parma on 20 August. The following day he was loaned to the newly promoted [[Serie B]] club [[Spezia Calcio|Spezia]] where he made 38 appearances, scoring seven goals and assisting six more. After his loan spell, he returned to Parma for the 2013–14 season, making only two Serie A matches as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcparma.com/flashnews/shirt-numbers-2013-14?lang=en|title=Shirt numbers 2013–14|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Parma F.C.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174727/http://fcparma.com/flashnews/shirt-numbers-2013-14?lang=en|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampdoria===
On 31 January 2014, Okaka was transferred to the fellow Serie A outfit [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] on a permanent deal, with [[Nicola Pozzi]] moving the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/okaka-e-un-calciatore-blucerchiato-pozzi-va-al-parma.html|title=Okaka è un calciatore blucerchiato, Pozzi va al Parma|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=9 February 2014|work=U.C.

He scored his first goal of the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15]] season on 14 September 2014, a solo effort, in the 2–0 victory against [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on 14 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimaldi|first1=Filippo|title=Sampdoria-Torino 2–0: Gabbiadini e Okaka, show a Marassi|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/14-09-2014/sampdoria-torino-2-0-gabbiadini-okaka-show-marassi-90446992070.shtml#|accessdate=28 June 2016|work=La Gazetta dello Sport|date=14 September 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2015, the owner and president of Sampdoria Massimo Ferrero told the Italian media that Okaka would be leaving the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampdoria, Ferrero: "No a Pazzini.

===Anderlecht===
On 28 July 2015, Okaka joined Belgian side [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] from Sampdoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official: Anderlecht sign Okaka|url=http://www.football-italia.net/70216/official-anderlecht-sign-okaka|website=Football Italia|accessdate=10 April 2016|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
On 29 August 2016, Okaka joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] from Anderlecht on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official: Okaka signs|url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/okaka-signs|website=Watford FC|accessdate=30 April 2016|date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He scored his first two goals for Watford on 10 December 2016, against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in a Premier League match which Watford went on to win 3–2. Okaka first equalised for the ''Hornets'' to make it one apiece, producing an elegant [[Glossary of association football terms|back-heeled]] strike from inside the six-yard box and then put his side 3–1 up after heading in from a corner. He was awarded the 'man of the match' in that game.

===Udinese===
On 8 January 2019, Okaka was signed by [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on a season long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.football-italia.net/132984/official-okaka-joins-udinese&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
After gaining Italian citizenship in 2007, Okaka was selected for the [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italian Under-19]] side. He made his debut for the Italy U-20 team in 2008, scoring two goals.&lt;ref name="figc_presenze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=3155&amp;squadra=3|publisher=FIGC.it|language=Italian|title= OKAPA CHUKA STEFANO – Convocazioni e presenze in campo|accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 2009, he made his debut with the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy U-21]] squad in a match against [[Luxembourg national under-21 football team|Luxembourg]].

In April 2014, Okaka revealed he was in talks with the [[Nigeria Football Federation]] about the possibility of him switching allegiance to his parents' country and play with the [[Nigeria national football team]] already at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/24-04-2014/okaka-gioca-la-nigeria-ci-penso-ma-sono-italiano-80512356275.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian |accessdate=25 April 2014 |date=24 April 2014 |title=Okaka gioca per la Nigeria? "Ci penso, ma sono italiano" |trans-title=Okaka playing for Nigeria? "I am thinking, but I am Italian" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Okaka was included in the Italy squad for their friendly against [[Albania national football team|Albania]] on 18 November 2014 by manager [[Antonio Conte]]. He made his debut as a substitute, replacing [[Sebastian Giovinco]] in the second half, and scored the winning goal at Sampdoria's ground the [[Stadio Luigi Ferraris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International friendly: Italy edge to narrow 1–0 victory over Albania in Genoa|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/327826/report|accessdate=19 November 2014|work=[[Sky Sports]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
