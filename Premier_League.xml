The '''Premier League''' (often referred to as the '''English Premier League''' ('''EPL''') outside [[England]]) is the top level of the [[English football league system]]. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[English Football League]] (EFL).

The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/fans/faqs/when-will-goal-line-technology-be-introduced.html When will goal-line technology be introduced?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709015312/http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/fans/faqs/when-will-goal-line-technology-be-introduced.html |date= 9 July 2013 }} The total number of matches can be calculated using the formula n*(n-1) where n is the total number of teams.&lt;/ref&gt; Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Premier League has featured 47 [[Association football in England|English]] and two [[Association football in Wales|Welsh]] clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border league.

The competition was formed as the '''FA Premier League''' on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the [[Football League First Division]] to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,626773,00.html |title=United (versus Liverpool) Nations |newspaper=The Observer |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was worth £1&amp;nbsp;billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with [[BSkyB]] and [[BT Group]] securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Gibson |title=Premier League lands £3bn deal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt/ |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 June 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league generates €2.2&amp;nbsp;billion per year in domestic and international television rights.&lt;ref name="international rights"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-11/top-soccer-leagues-get-25-rise-in-tv-rights-sales-report-says.html "Top Soccer Leagues Get 25% Rise in TV Rights Sales, Report Says"].

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. [[Stadium]]s were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/31/newsid_2481000/2481723.stm |title=1985: English teams banned after Heysel |work=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 August 2006 |date=31 May 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Football League First Division]], the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's [[Serie A]] and Spain's [[La Liga]] in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.&lt;ref name="premsitehistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0,,12306,00.html |title=A History of The Premier League |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118121453/http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0%2C%2C12306%2C00.html |archivedate=18 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse: at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], England reached the semi-finals; [[UEFA]], European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1991, and the [[Taylor Report]] on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], was published in January of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |title=The Taylor Report |publisher=Football Network |accessdate=22 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016222436/http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |archivedate=16 October 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. [[Martin Edwards]] of Manchester United, [[Irving Scholar]] of Tottenham Hotspur, and [[David Dein]] of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation. It gave the top clubs more power. By threatening to break away, clubs in Division One managed to increase their voting power. They took a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ6MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Association Game: A History of British Football |first=Matthew |last=Taylor |page=342 |publisher=Routledge |date=18 October 2013 |isbn=9781317870081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue from television also became more important: the Football League received £6.3&amp;nbsp;million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44&amp;nbsp;million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ6MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Association Game: A History of British Football |first=Matthew |last=Taylor |page=343 |publisher=Routledge |date=18 October 2013 |isbn=9781317870081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leicester_tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs8.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080220/http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs8.html |archivedate=6 June 2011 |title=Fact Sheet 8: British Football on Television |publisher=Centre for the Sociology of Sport, University of Leicester |last=Crawford |first=Gerry |accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scholar who was involved in  the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sO1zDQAAQBAJ |title=White Hart Lane: The Spurs Glory Years 1899–2017 |first=Martin |last=Lipton |chapter=Chapter 15: Mr Chairman |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=5 October 2017 |isbn=9781409169284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a "super league", but they were eventually persuaded to stay with the top clubs taking the lion share of the deal.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Super Ten Losing Ground |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZmFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7001%2C3212387 |date=14 July 1988 |newspaper=New Straits Times |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html |title=The History of the Football League |publisher=Football League |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=11 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411034859/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10794%2C00.html |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose, the country's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the influx of money into the sport.&lt;ref name="FLhistory"/&gt;

=== Foundation ===
{{See also|Foundation of the Premier League}}

In 1990, the managing director of [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT), [[Greg Dyke]], met with the representatives of the "big five" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner.&lt;ref name="Conn"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2013/sep/04/greg-dyke-premier-league-history |title=Greg Dyke seems to forget his role in the Premier League's formation |first=David |last=Conn |date=4 September 2013 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from [[The Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/1180279.stm |title=The Men who Changed Football |date= 20 February 2001 |work=BBC |accessdate=20 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2012/feb/02/20-years-premier-league-football-1992 |title=Premier League football at 20: 1992, the start of a whole new ball game |first=Jason |last=Rodrigues |date=2 February 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of [[The Football Association]] and so [[David Dein]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/23/deceit-determination-murdochs-millions-how-premier-league-was-born |title=Deceit, determination and Murdoch's millions: how Premier League was born |first=Paul |last=MacInnes |date=23 July 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |work=HM Courts Service |publisher=HM Government |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from [[The Football Association]] and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.&lt;ref name="premsitehistory"/&gt; Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as [[BSkyB]] won with a bid of £304&amp;nbsp;million over five years with the [[BBC]] awarded the highlights package broadcast on ''[[Match of the Day]]''.&lt;ref name="Conn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"/&gt;

In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League ''[[en masse]]'' and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a [[private limited company by shares|limited company]] working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in [[Lancaster Gate]].&lt;ref name="premsitehistory"/&gt; This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.&lt;ref name="FLhistory"/&gt;

The league held its first season in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93]]. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season. The first Premier League goal was scored by [[Brian Deane]] of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--the-premier-kickoff-fergusons-false-start-1540915.html |title=The Premier Kick-Off: Ferguson's false start |first=Phil |last=Shaw |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 August 1992 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=1&amp;seasonid=122 |title=Final 1992/1993 English Premier Table |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Racing Post |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61BMkbWA2?url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?comp_id=1# |archive-date=24 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Joe |title=Glory, Goals and Greed: Twenty Years of the Premier League |publisher=Random House |year=2011 |chapter=3.

=== "Top Four" dominance (2000s) ===
One significant feature of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the dominance of the so-called "Top Four" clubs: [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3908394.ece |title=Breaking up the Premier League's Big Four |date=11 May 2008 |last=Northcroft |first=Jonathan |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bestofrest&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=405515&amp;root=england&amp;&amp;cc=5739 |title=The best of the rest |date=29 January 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive, while every season during the 2000s saw the "Big Four" always qualifying for European competition. Following the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04]] season, Arsenal acquired the nickname "[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]" as they became the first club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3696197.stm |title=Arsenal make history |date=15 May 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arsenal Invincibles: How Wenger's 2003-04 Gunners went a season without defeat |first=Oli |last=Platt |work=Goal |date=11 December 2018 |accessdate=10 January 2019 |url= https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/arsenal-invincibles-how-wengers-2003-04-gunners-went-a/1xkm3tgyvsbjj1wzrewhqz0liu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, only four sides outside the "Top Four" managed to qualify for the Champions League: [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] ([[1999–2000 FA Premier League|1999–2000]]), [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] ([[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02]] and [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]]), [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] ([[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]]) and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ([[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]]) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.

In May 2008 [[Kevin Keegan]] stated that "Top Four" dominance threatened the division, "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Power of top four concerns Keegan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7384247.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier League chief executive [[Richard Scudamore]] said in defence: "There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scudamore defends 'boring' League |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7388360.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] finals, with only "Top Four" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool ([[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]]), Manchester United ([[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]]) and Chelsea ([[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|2012]]) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal ([[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|2006]]), Liverpool ([[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007]]), Chelsea ([[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]]) and Manchester United ([[2009 UEFA Champions League Final|2009]] and [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final|2011]]) all losing Champions League finals.&lt;ref name="ChampionsFinals"&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Champions League – History: Finals by season |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/champions/ |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds United were the only non-"Top Four" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League|2000–01 season]].

Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup or Europa League]] finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in [[2001 UEFA Cup Final|2001]]. Arsenal ([[2000 UEFA Cup Final|2000]]), [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] ([[2006 UEFA Cup Final|2006]]) and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] ([[2010 UEFA Cup Final|2010]]) all lost their finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Europa League – History: Finals by season |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/champions/index.html |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of the "Big Six" (2010s) ===
The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the "Top Four" with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the "Top Four" into the "Big Six".&lt;ref name="Jolly"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Changing dynamics of the 'Big Six' in Premier League title race |last=Jolly |first=Richard |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/changing-dynamics-of-the-big-six-in-premier-league-title-race |work=The National |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10 season]], Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] five years prior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/7907619/Champions-League-defeat-could-ruin-Tottenhams-season-says-Vedran-Corluka.html "Champions League defeat could ruin Tottenham's season says Vedran Corluka"].

That season also saw two of the "Big Four" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.&lt;ref name="Jolly" /&gt;

With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. If the teams are level on points and goal difference, play off for UEFA champions league spots will be played in neutral ground. In the following five seasons after the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]], ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal secure top-four finish for 20th straight season to reach Champions League after Manchester United defeat |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-secure-top-four-finish-for-20th-straight-season-to-qualify-for-champions-league-after-a7024176.html |first=Jack |last=De Menezes |publisher=Independent |date=11 May 2016 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]], the top four was breached by a non-Big Six side for the first time since Everton in 2005. [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] were the surprise winners of the league, qualifying for the Champions League as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leicester City win Premier League title after Tottenham draw at Chelsea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35988673 |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off the pitch, the "Big Six" wield financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Premier League clubs aim to block rich six's bid for a bigger share of TV cash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/premier-league-clubs-block-big-six-tv-cash |work=The Guardian |date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The changing shape of the Premier League: how the 'big six' are pulling away |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/02/changing-shape-premier-league-big-six-pulling-away/ |work=The Telegraph |date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]] [[Deloitte Football Money League#2016–17|Deloitte Football Money League]] report showed the financial disparity between the "Big Six" and the rest of the division. All of the "Big Six" had revenues greater than €350&amp;nbsp;million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3&amp;nbsp;million. Leicester City was the closest club to the "Big Six" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1&amp;nbsp;million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth largest revenue generator West Ham, who didn't play in European competition, had revenues of €213.3&amp;nbsp;million, nearly half of the club with the fifth largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42767374 |title=Manchester United remain football's top revenue-generator |work=BBC Sport |date=23 January 2018 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150&amp;nbsp;million to nearly £200&amp;nbsp;million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/06/premier-league-finances-club-guide-2016-17 |title=Premier League finances: the full club-by-club breakdown and verdict |first=David |last=Conn |date=6 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Deloitte's 2019 report, all of the "Big Six" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.sky.com/story/deloitte-football-money-league-2019-real-madrid-richest-ahead-of-barcelona-and-manchester-united-11615915&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition format ==

=== Competition ===
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin system]]), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents', for 38 games. Teams receive [[three points for a win]] and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are [[Group tournament ranking system|ranked]] by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporting-life.com/football/live/tables/premiership.html |title=Barclays Premier League |work=Sporting Life |publisher=365 Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Promotion and relegation===
A system of [[promotion and relegation]] exists between the Premier League and the [[EFL Championship]]. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Kevin |title=There are millions of reasons to want a promotion and avoid relegation in the English Premier League |url=http://beta.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-soccer-baxter-20160515-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 May 2016 |accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fisher |first=Ben |title=Fulham lead march of heavyweights in £200m Championship play-offs |work=The Guardian |date=9 May 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/may/09/fulham-heavyweights-200m-chmapionship-play-offs |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Premier League had 22 teams when it began in 1992, but this was reduced to the present 20-team format in 1995.&lt;ref name="evolved"/&gt;

====Wales====
In 2011, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time after [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] gained promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wathan |first=Chris |title=Rodgers looking for his Swans to peak in play-offs and reach Premier League summit |work=Western Mail |date=12 May 2011 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swansea wins promotion to EPL |publisher=ESPN.

Because they are members of the [[Football Association of Wales]] (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused [[Football in England#Welsh clubs|long-running discussions]] in [[UEFA]]. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] in 2013–14 by winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swans end Bantams fairytale |publisher=ESPN FC |date=24 February 2013 |url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/359954/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227022630/http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/359954/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uefa give Swansea and Cardiff European assurance |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17459332 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland and Ireland====
Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result.
The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] received Premier League approval to [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocate to Dublin, Ireland]], but the move was blocked by the [[Football Association of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="thewimbledonwehave"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hammam|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mihirbose"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mihir |last=Bose |authorlink=Mihir Bose |title=Hammam cast in villain's role as Dons seek happy ending |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/3010879/Inside-Sport-Hammam-cast-in-villains-role-as-Dons-seek-happy-ending.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |location=London |date=16 August 2001 |accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DublinDonsIndo230198&gt;{{cite news |title=Hammam meets grass-roots on whistle-stop tour |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hammam-meets-grassroots-on-whistlestop-tour-26199426.html |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=13 June 2013 |date=23 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DublinDonsIndo100698&gt;{{cite news |title=`Dublin Dons on way' Hammam |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/dublin-dons-on-way-hammam-26183373.html |first=Philip |last=Quinn |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=13 June 2013 |date=10 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.&lt;ref name="strachan"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Martyn |last1=Ziegler |first2=Ronnie |last2=Esplin |title=Celtic and Rangers will join European super league, says Scotland manager Gordon Strachan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic/9985432/Celtic-and-Rangers-will-join-European-super-league-says-Scotland-manager-Gordon-Strachan.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |location=London |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Qualification criteria for 2019–20 ====
{{See also|2019–20 UEFA Champions League#Association team allocation|l1=2019–20 UEFA Champions League§Association team allocation}}

The top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the subsequent season's [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. The winners of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]] also qualify for the subsequent season's [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League instead plays in the [[UEFA Europa League]], as any single nation is limited to a maximum of 5 teams.

The fifth-placed team in the Premier League qualifies for the subsequent season's [[UEFA Europa League]] group stage. The winner of the [[FA Cup]] also qualifies for the subsequent season's [[UEFA Europa League]] group stage, but if the winner also finished in the top five places in the Premier League, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the [[EFL Cup]] qualifies for the subsequent season's [[UEFA Europa League]] second qualifying round, but if the winner already qualified for a [[UEFA]] competition via the Premier League or FA Cup, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the [[FA Cup]] result already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier League clubs' UEFA qualification explained |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/671047 |publisher=Premier League |date=4 May 2018 |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of places allocated to English clubs in [[UEFA]] competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the [[UEFA coefficient#Country coefficient|UEFA country coefficients]], which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in [[UEFA]] competitions in the previous five years. Currently the ranking of England (and [[de facto]] the Premier League) is 2nd behind [[Spain]].

==== Previous seasons ====

An [[Liverpool F.C. 2005–06 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4613695.stm |title=Liverpool get in Champions League |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=index |title=EXCO approves new coefficient system |publisher=UEFA |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521053931/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind%3D64/newsid%3D698237.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=index |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|won]] the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/20/sport/football/football-chelsea-champions-league/index.html |title=Jubilant Chelsea parade Champions League trophy |publisher=CNN International |date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1992–93 and the 2017–18 seasons, Premier League clubs won the [[UEFA Champions League]] four times (and had six runners-up), behind Spain's [[La Liga]] with eleven wins, and Italy's [[Serie A]] with five wins; ahead of, among others, Germany's [[Bundesliga]] with three wins.&lt;ref name="ChampionsFinals"/&gt; The [[FIFA Club World Cup]] (originally called the FIFA Club World Championship) [[List of FIFA Club World Cup finals#Results by nation|has been won]] once by a Premier League club (Manchester United in [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup|2008]]),&lt;ref name="FIFA 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2008/matches/round=252219/match=300073127/index.html |title=Red Devils rule in Japan |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two runners-up (Liverpool in [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship|2005]], Chelsea in [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup|2012]]),&lt;ref name="FIFA 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA 2012" /&gt; behind Spain's La Liga with seven wins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/y=2017/m=12/news=real-madrid-presented-with-the-fifa-world-champions-badge-2925088.html |title=Real Madrid presented with the FIFA World Champions Badge |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brasileirão]] with four wins,&lt;ref name="FIFA 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2005/matches/round=47350600/match=47350007/index.html |title=Sao Paulo FC – Liverpool FC |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=18 December 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/matches/round=259327/match=300219235/index.html |title=Guerrero the hero as Corinthians crowned |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=16 December 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/brazil2000/matches/round=3695/match=22236/index.html |title=Corinthians – Vasco da Gama |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2006/matches/round=24830600/match=24830007/index.html |title=Sport Clube Internacional – FC Barcelona |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=17 December 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy's Serie A with two wins.&lt;ref name="FIFA 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/matches/round=249933/match=61295/report.html |title=Boca Juniors – AC Milan |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/uae2010/matches/round=254488/match=300140542/index.html |title=Internazionale on top of the world |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 2016, the Premier League had [[title sponsor]]ship rights sold to two companies, which were [[Carling brewery]] and [[Barclays Bank PLC]]; [[Barclays]] was the most recent title sponsor, having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 until 2016 (until 2004, the title sponsorship was held through its [[Barclaycard]] brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5384750.stm |title=Barclays nets Premier League deal |date=27 September 2006 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a "clean" brand for the competition more in line with those of [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major U.S. sports leagues]].&lt;ref name=espn-notitlesponsor&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier League closes door on title sponsorship from 2016 to 2017 season |url=http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/story/2479193/premier-league-closes-door-on-sponsorship-from-2016-17 |accessdate=7 June 2015 |work=ESPN FC |agency=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world.

Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Austin |title=Premier League clubs agree new cost controls |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20773526 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of "merit" which was based upon final league position.&lt;ref name="Premier League"/&gt; The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).&lt;ref name="Premier League"/&gt;

Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to [[Sky plc|BSkyB]] in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.&lt;ref name="leicester_tv"/&gt;

The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8545202.stm |title=Why TV is the key to Real success |first=Nils |last=Blythe |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money is divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Faqs/0,,12306,00.html |title=Frequently asked questions about the F.A.

The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/premier-league-nets-16314bn-tv-rights-bonanza-1925462.html |title=Premier League nets £1.4bn TV rights bonanza |newspaper=The Independent |last=Harris |first=Nick |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304&amp;nbsp;million over five seasons.&lt;ref name="fgrc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.sky.com/about_sky/timeline.htm |title=BSkyB Timeline |publisher=BSkyB |accessdate=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670&amp;nbsp;million over four seasons.&lt;ref name="fgrc"/&gt; The third contract was a £1.024&amp;nbsp;billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320&amp;nbsp;million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2005 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/160604/premier-league-launches-international-rights-tender |title=Premier League launches international rights tender |work=SportBusiness |publisher=SBG Companies Ltd. |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when [[Setanta Sports]] was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the [[European Commission]] that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7&amp;nbsp;billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3&amp;nbsp;pm match solely for Irish viewers. The [[BBC]] has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on ''[[Match of the Day]]'') for £171.6&amp;nbsp;million, a 63&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent increase on the £105&amp;nbsp;million it paid for the previous three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/5060828.stm |title=BBC keeps Premiership highlights |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky and [[BT Group|BT]] have agreed to jointly pay £84.3&amp;nbsp;million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10&amp;nbsp;pm on matchday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/sport/2006/05/26/sfntv26.xml |title=TV deal pays another £84m |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |first=David |last=Bond}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas television rights fetched £625&amp;nbsp;million, nearly double the previous contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6273617.stm |title=Premiership in new £625m TV deal |accessdate=3 June 2007 |date=18 January 2007 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7&amp;nbsp;billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40&amp;nbsp;million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8595655.stm |title=Premier League clubs benefit from new overseas TV deal |date=30 March 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Widening gap with lower leagues ==
{{See also|Premier League–Football League gulf|Premier League Parachute and Solidarity Payments}}
There has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the [[English Football League|Football League]], many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues,&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1771399,00.html |title=Rich clubs forced to give up a sliver of the TV pie |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2006 |first=David |last=Conn |date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02]], 2011–12 and 2017–18, at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In [[1997–98 FA Premier League|1997–98]], all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1997/98 – Season Review |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=333233&amp;root=extratime&amp;cc=5739 |last=Brewin |first=John |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=29 November 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of "parachute payments". Starting with the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] season, these payments are in excess of £60&amp;nbsp;million over four seasons.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier League's relegated clubs to receive £60m boost |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22171365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="Mail Sport"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hull set for £120m cash windfall if they win promotion to Premier League |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2315255/Hull-set-make-extra-120m-win-promotion-Premier-League.html |work=Daily Mail |first=Paul |last=Collins |date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the average [[Football League Championship]] club receives £2&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name="Guardian Sport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Richard Scudamore takes big stick to Championship over parachute money |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/16/premier-league-championship-parachute-payments}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=James |title=Why clubs may risk millions for riches at the end of the rainbow |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html |date=5 August 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the common occurrence of teams "[[Premier League–Football League gulf|bouncing back]]" soon after their relegation. For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases [[Administration (British football)|administration]] or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier+League+casualties+-+clubs+that+have+struggled+since+relegation/article.do |title=Premier League casualties – clubs that have struggled since relegation |newspaper=Evening Standard |publisher=Daily Mail &amp; General Trust |first1=Ben |last1=Bailey |first2=Patrick |last2=Whyte |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322034918/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier%2BLeague%2Bcasualties%2B-%2Bclubs%2Bthat%2Bhave%2Bstruggled%2Bsince%2Brelegation/article.do |archivedate=22 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2299511/Down-again-Leicesters-relegation-horror.html |title=Down again: Leicester's relegation horror |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managers ==
{{See also|List of Premier League managers}}
[[Manager (association football)|Managers]] in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Managers, directors and trust in professional football |first1=Seamus |last1=Kelly |first2=John |last2=Harris |journal=Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=489–502 |doi=10.1080/17430431003588150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers are required to have a [[UEFA Pro Licence]] which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the [[UEFA]] 'B' and 'A' Licences.&lt;ref name="licences"&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Duncan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/12/05/sfnkmo05.xml |title=The Knowledge |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (''i.e.'', more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified [[caretaker manager]] is allowed to take control).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/chelsea/article2508204.ece |title=Avram Grant's job under threat from lack of Uefa licence |newspaper=The Times |first1=Matt |last1=Hughes |first2=Martin |last2=Samuel |date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including [[Paul Hart]] at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[David Pleat]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

[[Arsène Wenger]] is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Premier League from 1996 to his retirement at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by [[Alex Ferguson]], who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 2017–18 and 2018-19 season, 12 managers were sacked, the most recent being [[José Mourinho]] of [[Manchester United|Manchester United]].

There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign players and transfer regulations ===
{{See also|List of foreign Premier League players|List of foreign Premier League goalscorers}}

At the inception of the Premier League in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93]], just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4487212-3057,00.html |last=Atkinson |first=Ron |title=England need to stem the foreign tide |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 August 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65TlYTLaE?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/aug/23/sport.comment/print |archivedate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[2000–01 FA Premier League|2000–01]], the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]] season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,474626,00.html |title=Phil Neal: King of Europe? |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=10 August 2006 |first=Sean |last=Ingle |date=12 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4266443.stm |title=Wenger backs non-English line-up |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8182090.stm |title=Where the Premier League's players come from |date=17 August 2009 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=3 October 2010 |first=Ollie |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, in 1999, the [[Home Office]] tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=32096&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |title=New Work Permit Criteria for Football Players Announced |work=Department for Education and Employment |publisher=HM Government |date=2 July 1999 |accessdate=1 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154815/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=32096&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.&lt;ref name=HOworkpermits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/work_permits0/applying_for_a_work/sports_and_entertainers/football_players.html |title=Work permit arrangements for football players |work=Home Office |publisher=HM Government |accessdate=1 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926091514/http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/work_permits0/applying_for_a_work/sports_and_entertainers/football_players.html |archivedate=26 September 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players may only be [[Transfer (association football)|transferred]] during [[transfer window]]s that are set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/7a/20/0,,12306~139386,00.pdf |title=Premier League rules |publisher=Premier League |year=2010 |page=150 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306153852/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/7a/20/0%2C%2C12306~139386%2C00.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]], the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=PLHomeGrownPlayerRules16Jul2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2094341,00.html |title=Home Grown Player rules |publisher=Premier League |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813203222/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~2094341%2C00.html |archivedate=13 August 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC27July2010NewRules&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8858634.stm |title=New Premier League squad rules explained |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to enable the "home grown" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be "home-grown players".&lt;ref name=PLHomeGrownPlayerRules16Jul2010/&gt;

=== Player wages ===

There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,1009392,00.html |title=Forty factors fuelling football inflation |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 July 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99&amp;nbsp;million.

The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 was £1.62bn, this compares to £1.05bn in [[La Liga]], £0.83bn in [[Serie A]], £0.72bn in [[Bundesliga]], and £0.54bn in [[Ligue 1]]. The club with the highest average wages is [[Manchester United]] at £6.5m. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain ([[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]] £10.5m), and Italy ([[Juventus]] £6.7m), but higher than in Germany ([[Bayern Munich]] £6.4m), and France ([[Paris St Germain]] 6.1m).

Th ratio of the wages of the highest paid team to lowest paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in [[La Liga]] (19.1 to 1), [[Serie A]] (16 to 1), [[Bundesliga]] (20.5 to 1), and [[Ligue 1]] (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalsportssalaries.com |title=Global Sports Salaries Survey 2018 |publisher=Sporting Intelligence |date=27 November 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Player transfer fees ===
{{See also|Progression of British football transfer fee record|List of most expensive association football transfers}}

The [[Progression of British football transfer fee record|record transfer fee]] for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Prior to the start of the first Premier League season [[Alan Shearer]] became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="OSMtransfers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1720979,00.html |title=From £250,000 to £29.1m |newspaper=The Observer |date=5 March 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record has increased steadily and [[Philippe Coutinho]] is now the most expensive transfer involving a Premier League club at £106&amp;nbsp;million. The highest transfer fee paid by a Premier League club is £89&amp;nbsp;million for [[Paul Pogba]].

The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers [[Garrard &amp; Co|Asprey of London]]. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a [[malachite]] plinth base. The plinth weighs {{convert|33|lb|kg}} and the trophy weighs {{convert|22|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Size and weight of the Barclays Premier League trophy |url=http://premierleague.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28/~/size-and-weight-of-the-barclays-premier-league-trophy |work=premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112081448/http://premierleague.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28/~/size-and-weight-of-the-barclays-premier-league-trophy |archivedate=12 January 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy and plinth are {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|43|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="Trophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/learn-english/premier-league-trophy |title=The Premier League Trophy |accessdate=22 January 2013 |work=Premier Skills |publisher=British Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main body is solid [[sterling silver]] and silver [[gilding|gilt]], while its plinth is made of malachite, a [[semi-precious]] stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play.&lt;ref name="Trophy"/&gt; The design of the trophy is based on the [[heraldry]] of [[Royal Arms of England|Three Lions]] that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sponsorship.barclays.co.uk/football/trophy-tour-fact.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122094405/http://www.sponsorship.barclays.co.uk/football/trophy-tour-fact.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 November 2010 |title=What makes the Barclays Premier League Trophy so special? |publisher=Barclays |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.

=== Player and manager awards ===
In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual [[List of Premier League winning players|winner's medals]] awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.
