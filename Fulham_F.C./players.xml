In his second season, Sessegnon renewed his form, and helped Fulham achieve promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.

Sessegnon has previously represented his country at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] levels.

'''Denis Frimpong Odoi''' (born 27 May 1988) is a Belgian [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sporza.be/permalink/1.1013325 |title=Anderlecht snatches Odoi away from Sint-Truiden |language=dutch |date=29 April 2011 |publisher=sporza.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sporza.be/permalink/1.1046497 |title=Odoi: "Standard did not show any respect" |language=dutch |date=17 June 2011 |publisher=sporza.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is from Ghana and his mother is from Belgium.

On 14 July 2016, it was announced that Odoi had signed for [[Football League Championship|English Championship]] side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. Odoi signed for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-year contract with an option of a further 12 months.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Odoi is a right-footed full-back who can operate on either side. He mainly played at left-back for the past 3 years for his former club, [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]]. He prefers playing centre back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fulham-denis-odoi-tomas-kalas-14399182.amp |title=Odoi: I've no idea whether I'll keep my starting spot |date=13 March 2018 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fulham==
On 5 August 2016, Odoi made his debut for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in a 1–0 win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]- his debut drawing acclaim for his "outrageous display of skill" controlling the ball off of his back shoulder.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11681/10524689/fulhams-denis-odoi-with-outrageous-skill-off-his-back |title=Fulham's Denis Odoi with Outrageous Skill off His Back |language=english |date=6 August 2016 |publisher=skysports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Fulham in a 3–2 win against [[Wigan Athletic]] on 11 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38865828 |title=Fulham 3–2 Wigan |publisher=BBC |date=11 February 2017 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017 he nearly signed for [[AA Gent]] but stayed on an improved contract following intervention from the Fulham chairman's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportwitness.co.uk/fulham-player-confirms-interest-another-club/ |title=Fulham player confirms interest from another club, glad chairman's son stopped move – Sport Witness |first=A. |last=E. |date=27 April 2018 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2018 he scored the winning goal as Fulham beat [[Derby County]] to reach the [[2018 EFL Championship play-off Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44026478 |title=Fulham 2–0 Derby County (Agg 2–1) |date=14 May 2018 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
He made his senior Belgian debut in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cottagersconfidential.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2016/7/14/12188408/denis-odoi-signs-from-lokeren&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McDonald was born in [[Montréal]], [[Québec]], the son of Sheila and Hamilton "Hammy" McDonald, who was a dental equipment salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/18/Kevin-McDonald.html|title=Kevin McDonald Biography (1961-)|website=www.filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of seven, after his father was transferred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kithfan.org/kith/kevin.html|title=KITHfan.org : Kids in the Hall : Kevin McDonald|website=www.kithfan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family subsequently lived in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] as well. McDonald has a younger sister, Sandra.

During an interview on ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', McDonald discussed his father's severe [[alcoholism]], which inspired the ''Kids In The Hall'' sketches "Daddy Drank" and "Girl Drink Drunk". Although he calls his mother "a wonderful woman," she was nevertheless reluctant to leave him until Kevin turned 19, when his father's drinking had escalated to two bottles of vodka daily. McDonald, his mother and sister rented an apartment, where they quietly moved their belongings "every night [after his father would] collapse on the stairs." Once they had completely moved, his parents divorced, his father lost his job, went bankrupt and lived in a homeless shelter for a year, during which he abstained from drinking (although he alleged "his roommates were drinking Drano"); coincidentally, Kevin McDonald would use the same building to rehearse with ''The Kids In The Hall'' as they were starting out on stage. His father was able to find employment at a flower shop, then an apartment and, over time, resume his career in dental equipment sales. Eventually, he did drink again, but not to the extent he had earlier in his life. He died of an [[aneurysm]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE-vR-bHI7Q|title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast Episode 477 Kevin Macdonald / Kevin McDonald|first=|last=Freddie Hodges|date=19 October 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin McDonald would use his relationship with his father as the basis for a one-man show, "Hammy And The Kids", in which he said he had no happy ending to the story of his father;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipstercrite.com/2010/09/06/hammy-and-the-kids/|title=Hammy and the Kids|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, during his interview with [[Marc Maron]], he said after one performance of his one-man show, he was approached by a stranger who said that he had served his father as a bartender, and that his father mentioned how proud he was of his son, the famous comedian, which moved McDonald to tears "like the ending to a bad movie."

McDonald briefly studied acting at a community college, where he was kicked out for being "a one-legged actor" (i.e. he could perform comedy, but not drama) by a dean who had a leg amputated, and was therefore a literal one-legged actor. However, [[William B. Davis]], who would later find fame in his portrayal of [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] on ''[[The X-Files]]'', was one of his professors, saw McDonald's potential and encouraged him to pursue [[improv comedy]] by giving him the number to [[The Second City]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During his youth, he had a weight problem. It wasn't until just prior to ''The Kids in the Hall'' in the late 1980s that he went from overweight to rather skinny. Several sketches and monologues allude to the issue, and a stockier McDonald can be seen in archival footage on ''The Kids in the Hall'' on [[DVD]] [[box sets]].

==Career==
McDonald founded [[The Kids in the Hall]] comedy troupe with his friend [[Dave Foley]]. They met in [[Toronto]] at the [[Second City Training Center]], and the two wrote and performed in sketches together more than any other pair in the group. In the troupe's TV show and stage shows, he portrays several popular recurring characters, such as the King of Empty Promises, Sir Simon Milligan, and Jerry Sizzler. A frequent running gag was that McDonald is the least popular member and always struggling not to get kicked out.

When the troupe ended the five-season run of its [[List of The Kids in the Hall episodes|eponymous television series]] in 1994, the five members moved to a number of solo projects. McDonald has played roles in movies like ''[[Boy Meets Girl (1998 film)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', [[Agent Pleakley]] in the [[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]], and [[Harry Potter]] in ''[[Epic Movie]]''. On [[television]], he has appeared on ''[[The Martin Short Show]]'', ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' (as a radio personality), ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (as a confused young cleric, Pastor Dave), ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'' (on which Foley starred), ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[Corner Gas]]''. McDonald has also done voice work for various animated series, including ''[[Invader Zim]]'' (in which he did the voice for Almighty Tallest Purple), ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'', ''[[Catscratch]]'' (in which he voiced Waffle), and ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''. He also played an [[imaginary friend]] named Ivan in the ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' episode ''Sight For Sore Eyes'', and appeared in the music video for "Roses" by [[OutKast]].

In 2006, McDonald hosted a [[CBC Television]] special, ''Sketch with Kevin McDonald'', featuring several of Canada's best-known sketch comedy troupes. The special received two nominations, for the performances by [[The Minnesota Wrecking Crew]] and by The Imponderables, for [[Canadian Comedy Award]] in the category Best Taped Live Performance, with The Minnesota Wrecking Crew winning the award.

Since 2000, McDonald and the other members of The Kids in the Hall have reunited for [[The Kids in the Hall#End of the show and beyond|a number of tours and televised performances]]. The troupe played the 2007 [[Just for Laughs]] festival, where McDonald also performed his one-and-a half-man show ''Hammy and the Kids'' with [[Craig Northey]], based on his two [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] families, his father ("Hammy") and The Kids in the Hall.

'''Neeskens Kebano''' (born 10 March 1992) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for English club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He plays as an [[midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].

He made his youth international debut at the [[2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Kebano was born in the commune of [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]], Île-de-France. He was given the first name ''Neeskens'' as a homage to the former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch international]] [[midfielder]] [[Johan Neeskens]] whom his father, Nestor Kebano, was a big admirer of.&lt;ref name="kebano_montereau"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://montereau.typepad.fr/montereau/2006/09/neeskens_kebano.html | title = Neeskens Kebano: "le PSG est une fierté teintée de lucidité" | date = 25 September 2006 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]] | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721022301/http://montereau.typepad.fr/montereau/2006/09/neeskens_kebano.html | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/actualite/528319.shtml | title = Kebano: "Etre digne de cette convocation" | date = 23 March 2009 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/1140-neeskens-kebano-en-hommage-a-johan-neeskens.html | title = Neeskens Kebano en hommage à Johan Neeskens | date = 26 March 2009 | work = Espoirs du Football | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kebano was immersed into football at an early age and began his career playing for hometown club ASA Montereau.&lt;ref name ="kebano_montereau"/&gt; While at Montereau, he also competed in judo before opting to focus on football.&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"/&gt; In 2004, Kebano was among a host of players attempting to earn selection to the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] academy.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fK4HAw1oHYIJ:lestitisdupsg.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!237F13A51E00435!12725.entry%3F%26_c02_owner%3D1+Neeskens+Kebano+techniquement&amp;cd=25&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com | title = Interview N°213: Neeskens Kebano | date = 10 October 2009 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = Les Titis du PSG | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the academy's detection camp, he drew interest from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] scout Pierre Reynaud. The club contacted the player and offered him a trial at the club, which he accepted. After spending the 2005 season playing at Montereau, Kebano was contacted again by Paris Saint-Germain who brought him in for a second trial in December 2005. In the following January, the club signed him on an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract and he joined the club in July 2006.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt;

===Paris Saint-Germain===
Kebano began his Paris Saint-Germain career at the club's youth academy in the [[Camp des Loges]]. He was placed on the club's under-14 team and formed friendships with youth and international teammates Jimmy Kamghain, Alassane Tambe, and Bastien Héry.&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"/&gt; The combination of the four were particularly instrumental in their youth team's success. With the under-14 team, Kebano won the ''Championnat Fédéraux de 14 ans''.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt; In the next season with the club's under-15 team, he played on the team that won the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]]. The team won its league, the Division d'Honneur, and also captured the Coupe de Paris.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt; At under-16 level, Paris Saint-Germain and Kebano won the ''Championnat National des 16 ans''. Though, he is still eligible to compete at youth level, ahead of the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 season]], Kebano was promoted to the club's [[Championnat de France amateur]] team in the fourth division. He was also placed onto the club's squad for the [[UEFA Europa League]] being assigned the number 38 shirt by manager [[Antoine Kombouaré]].

Kebano made his amateur debut on 8 August 2010 in a 1–0 victory over [[FC Bourg-Péronnas|Bourg-Péronnas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Paris SG B v. Bourg-Péronnas Match Report | url = http://www.foot-national.com/fiche-match-football-24081.html | date = 8 August 2010 | work = Foot-National | accessdate = 2 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, he scored his first amateur goal in a 4–1 win over [[Monts d'Or Azergues Foot|Monts d'Or Azergues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Monts d'Or Azergues v.

He appeared on the substitute's bench, but failed to make his debut as Paris Saint-Germain and Karpaty drew 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000128/match=2003039/index.html | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Karpaty and PSG make their point |language = French |date = 15 December 2010 | accessdate = 30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the winter break, Kebano returned to the club's reserve team and spent January playing with the team. In February 2011, he was called back up to the senior team after being named to the 18-man roster to play amateur club [[FC Martigues|Martigues]] in the [[Coupe de France]]. On 2 February, Kebano made his professional debut in the match appearing as a substitute for [[Mevlüt Erdinç]] in a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/14841-neeskens-kebano-debute-en-pro.html | title = Neeskens Kebano débute en pro | date = 2 February 2011 | work = Espoirs du Football | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/73932 | title = Martigues v.

On 14 August 2012, Kebano was loaned to [[Ligue 2]] side [[Stade Malherbe Caen|SM Caen]]. As the 2012–13 season ended, Kebano was released to [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]].

===Fulham===

'''Thomas Cairney''' (born 20 January 1991) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Fulham}} club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. Cairney has previously played for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Born in England, he made his full international debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in March 2017. Cairney had previously represented Scotland at [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels.

==Early life==
Cairney was born and raised in [[Nottingham]], Nottinghamshire, to a Scottish father, who worked as a miner and then as a taxi driver.&lt;ref name="Cairney Daily Record"/&gt; He also revealed that his father would take him to Scotland and watch [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a youngster.&lt;ref name="Cairney Daily Record"/&gt; When he was about 15 or 16, he worked for Barclays Bank for work experience. He described this as the "worst two weeks of [his] life!" and had to work 9–5 in a bank and wear suit and tie for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rovers.co.uk/news/2014/september/getting-personal-with-tom-cairney/|title='Getting Personal' with Tom Cairney|publisher=Blackburn Rovers F.C.|date=15 September 2014|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906205737/https://www.rovers.co.uk/news/2014/september/getting-personal-with-tom-cairney/|archivedate=7 September 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Cairney was released from the [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] youth system at the age of 16 after being told he was too small. He had been with the club since the age of seven.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio Humberside"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sports Talk|network=BBC|station=BBC Radio Humberside|location=Hull|airdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull look likely to benefit from Cairney's keenness to prove Leeds wrong|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/hull-look-likely-to-benefit-from-cairney-s-keenness-to-prove-leeds-wrong-1-2559976 |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=2 February 2010|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on his time at Leeds United, he said: "To be honest it crushed me, it crushed me a lot, I was with Leeds from I was seven to 16 so it was a big part of my life. I was going there three-four times a week, missing days of schools, and obviously my mum and dad had put a lot into it too. So getting released at 16, it just felt like, ‘oh no, after all that effort’. But I was determined I would not stop there. I went to Hull and they offered me a YTS as they obviously saw something. And from 16–18 I shot up in height and then it went back to my footballing ability. From getting released at 16 to making my Premier League debut – if you wrote it down you wouldn't believe it. I owe a lot to (then Hull manager) [[Phil Brown (footballer, born 1959)|Phil Brown]] as he believed in me. I think the academy staff at Leeds must have got a bit of a shock when they saw me playing in the Premier League! I don’t know what happened to them but I think they may have got a telling off!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leeds United release left me crushed but it also inspired me, says Blackburn Rovers star Tom Cairney|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/11315829.Leeds_United_release_left_me_crushed_but_it_also_inspired_me__says_Blackburn_Rovers_star_Tom_Cairney/ |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |location=Blackburn |date=3 July 2014|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hull City===

'''Ryan Guno Babel''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrɑjɐn ˈbaːbəl}}; born 19 December 1986)&lt;ref name="LFC profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/first-team/player/19-ryan-babel |title=Liverpool F.C. Official profile |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128060918/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/first-team/player/19-ryan-babel |archivedate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. He can play as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] or [[Winger (soccer)|left winger]].

Babel began his career at Ajax in 1998, working his way up through the youth team and into the senior squad. He played three seasons for the first team before he was transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in mid-2007, where under three successive managers he failed to secure a regular first team position. Babel was sold to [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] in January 2011, for a sum around half of that which Liverpool paid for him. His time at Hoffenheim was marred with disciplinary problems with three managers at the club. In the summer of 2012, Babel bought out the remaining final year of his contract, making him a free agent, and re-signed a one-year contract with Ajax. After this season, Babel went on to sign with Turkish club [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]] on 21 June 2013. Babel often was linked to a return to the Premier League during his time in Turkey, before ending rumours by signing for UAE side [[Al Ain FC]] in July 2015.

Babel has been part of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] since 2005, and has represented his country at all youth team levels. He played in two World Cups, 2006 and 2010, reaching the final of the latter.

==Early career==
Babel was born in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Inspired by the local footballing talent, including [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]], Babel played for nearby youth-teams S.V Diemen, then Fortius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelofficial.com/en/biography.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529051821/http://www.babelofficial.com/en/biography.asp |archivedate=29 May 2010 |title=Biography |publisher=Babelofficial.com |accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he attended a youth selection day with [[AFC Ajax]]. He made it through the first selection round, but failed to progress any further.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=ryanbabel.nl |url=http://www.ryanbabel.nl/ryanbabel/biografie.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823165051/http://www.ryanbabel.nl/ryanbabel/biografie.html |archivedate=23 August 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2007 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next year Ajax accepted him and he played the 1999–2000 season for their D1 team.&lt;ref name=biography/&gt; After having graduated through the C1, B1 and A1 teams, Babel signed his first professional contract in January 2004.&lt;ref name=biography/&gt;

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Playing as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]], on 1 February 2004, just one and a half months after his 17th birthday, Babel made his first-team debut in Ajax's 4–0 home win over [[ADO Den Haag]] in the [[Eredivisie]].&lt;ref name=ARCHIVES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=61694 |title=Extension for Ryan Babel |publisher=AFC Ajax |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313203650/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154814/contentid%3D61694 |archivedate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax went on to win the Dutch league title, but Babel didn't feature again that season. Nine months later, on 20 November 2004 Babel scored his first senior goal against [[De Graafschap]] in a 5–0 victory.&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=26825.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165032/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=26825.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |title=Babel rewarding Van Basten's faith |publisher=FIFA |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Babel signed a new contract with Ajax. He started the new season by scoring the winning goal in Ajax's 2–1 defeat of [[PSV Eindhoven]] in the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]]. Babel scored in both legs of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] third qualifying round against [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] as Ajax made it to the group stage. 2005–06 was a tougher season for Babel in general though as he managed only two league goals. He did however continue to feature for the national team, and scored his second goal against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in November. At the end of the season, Babel came on as a second-half [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in Ajax's 2–1 victory over PSV in the [[KNVB Cup]] final.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Babel marked the start of 2006–07 with another Johan Cruyff Shield medal, as Ajax defeated PSV 3–1. Babel was linked with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United]] during the January transfer window of the [[2007 in football (soccer)|2006–07 season]] but no move materialised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/news/article2137748.ece |title=West Ham in for Ljungberg as Arsenal line up Dutch star |last=Burt |first=Jason |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714071255/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/news/article2137748.ece |archivedate=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/2402772/babel-catching-magpies-eye |title=Babel catching Magpies' eye |last=van Leeuwen |first=Gerrit |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the transfer speculation, Babel agreed to a new three-year deal with Ajax on 2 February 2007.&lt;ref name="ARCHIVES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=472023&amp;CPID=9&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=&amp;title=Ajax+star+wowed+by+Wenger |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703085837/http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=472023&amp;CPID=9&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=&amp;title=Ajax+star+wowed+by+Wenger |archivedate=3 July 2007 |title=Ajax star wowed by Wenger |publisher=Sky Sports |date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Babel got another Dutch Cup winners medal as Ajax successfully defended the title. The match against AZ went to a penalty shoot-out, but Babel was substituted off after 120 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/clubs/knvbbeker/archief/knvb_beker_nieuw/ajax_wint_beker_na_thriller |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204033937/http://www.knvb.nl/clubs/knvbbeker/archief/knvb_beker_nieuw/ajax_wint_beker_na_thriller |archivedate=4 February 2010 |title=Ajax win cup in thriller |publisher=Royal Dutch Football Association |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 10 July 2007 it was reported that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] had made a [[pound sterling|£]]14&amp;nbsp;million offer to the Amsterdam club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6285040.stm |title=Liverpool make improved Babel bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July it was reported that Liverpool and Ajax had agreed a fee in the region of £11.5&amp;nbsp;million, and later Liverpool confirmed that Babel would sign a five-year contract on 13 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Eaton |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/babel-to-sign-for-reds-today |title=Babel set to sign on Friday |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=23 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160941/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/babel-to-sign-for-reds-today |archivedate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unveiled on 13 July with [[Yossi Benayoun]]. Babel was handed the number 19 shirt. He made his debut on 17 July against [[Werder Bremen]] in a friendly. He was due to play in the first round of the [[Barclays Asia Trophy 2007]] but had a delay in the granting of international clearance. This was sorted out in time for the final against Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11669/2621711/reds-reach-asia-trophy-final |title=Reds reach Asia Trophy final |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his [[Premier League]] debut in the 2007–08 Premier League curtain raiser against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] away after coming on off the bench. A week later he made his [[Anfield]] debut, coming off the bench against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. On 1 September Babel scored his first goal for Liverpool against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6963702.stm |title=Liverpool 6–0 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Chris |last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored his first Champions League goal for Liverpool on 6 November against [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] after coming on as a substitute. He netted twice in the game and almost completed a hat-trick, with a header from a [[Harry Kewell]] cross, but was denied by the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7076592.stm |title=Liverpool 8–0 Besiktas |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored the fourth and last goal in Liverpool's [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage]] match against [[Olympique de Marseille]], which they needed to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7136346.stm |title=Marseille 0–4 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=John |last=Sinnott}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench in the second leg of the quarter final against Arsenal in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and won a penalty and scored a goal, with Liverpool winning the game 4–2 (5–3 on aggregate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7332209.stm |title=Liverpool 4–2 Arsenal (agg 5–3) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also came on as a substitute against Chelsea in the semi-final and despite scoring a goal, Liverpool lost 3–2 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7368736.stm |title=Chelsea 3–2 Liverpool (4–3) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Sam |last=Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Liverpool and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] player [[Kenny Dalglish]] has said that Babel has the ability to terrorise defenders in the Premier League with his pace and trickery with the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/kenny-babel-is-terrifying |title=Kenny: Babel Is Terrifying |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=23 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114541/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/kenny-babel-is-terrifying |archivedate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2008, Babel came off the bench to score the winner for Liverpool in a 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United]], his first goal of the [[Premier League 2008-09|2008–09 season]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/babel-propels-liverpool-to-win-over-manchester-united-1.719115 |title=Babel propels Liverpool to win over Manchester United |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 September 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored his second goal of the season in Liverpool's 5–1 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 28 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7788422.stm |title=Newcastle 1–5 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2009, against West Ham, Babel came off the bench for Dirk Kuyt. At this stage the score was 2–2. Babel picked up the ball and did well to beat the full-back and sent in a delightful cross for [[Fernando Torres]] to head home the winner. Babel, who has been criticised in the past for his work rate and attitude, earned praise for his efforts in the West Ham game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N165837090920-0012.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126140048/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N165837090920-0012.htm |archivedate=26 November 2009 |title=Torres: My goal debt to Babel |first=Steve |last=Hunter |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 27 September 2009, Babel scored two goals against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] coming off the bench for Fernando Torres to round up a match which ended 6–1 for Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8270616.stm |title=Liverpool 6–1 Hull |date=26 September 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 November 2009 |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2009, Babel scored the opening goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in a Champions League game, a strike from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw. Former Liverpool player [[Alan Hansen]] called upon Babel to play like he did against Lyon, as he still possessed the ability to be a 'top player'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8338788.stm |title=Lyon 1–1 Liverpool |date=4 November 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 November 2009 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2010, it was reported that Liverpool rejected an £8&amp;nbsp;million offer from [[Birmingham City F.C|Birmingham City]] for Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8443286.stm |title=Birmingham's £8m bid for Liverpool's Ryan Babel denied |date=6 January 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel was then disciplined by manager Benitez, over stating on his Twitter page that he had been dropped for the game against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], and was fined two weeks wages of £120,000. He was frequently linked with a move away from Anfield but Rafael Benitez stated his desire for Babel to stay. On 15 March 2010 he scored against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a 4–1 win. On 1 April 2010, he was [[sent off]] for the first time in his Liverpool career in the 30th minute of the first leg of the [[Europa League]] quarter-final against [[S.L. Benfica]] after an altercation with [[Luisão]]. He scored in Liverpool's 4–0 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at Turf Moor, subsequently relegating Burnley to the Championship.
On 19 August 2010, Babel scored the winner against [[Trabzonspor]] in the [[Europa League]] qualifier first leg, it was his first game of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8924283.stm |title=Liverpool 1 – 0 Trabzonspor |date=19 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 August 2010 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his first match in the Premier League at [[Anfield]] against Aston Villa and scored his first goal in the Premier League with a right-footed volley that beat former Liverpool goalkeeper [[Brad Friedel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Babel gained further notoriety amongst fans when, on [[Transfer window|transfer deadline day]] 31 August 2010, it was reported that the player was travelling by helicopter between Liverpool and an unspecified London location as possible transfer talks with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] were ongoing, and there was speculation about his true destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2010/08/31/2097031/ryan-babel-reveals-on-twitter-im-going-nowhere-after |title=Ryan Babel reveals on Twitter 'I'm going nowhere' after Liverpool accept Tottenham's £5m offer |publisher=Goal.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No transfer actually occurred and the helicopter story may be apocryphal, but the image stuck and the term "Babelcopter" became a metaphor for players with an uncertain destination on future transfer deadline days, with the player himself promoting the use of the [[hashtag]] #BabelCopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anchorfan.com/image/babelcopter-takes-off-again-with-ryan-babel-reckons-adam-may-be-on-his-way-59191.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831054542/http://www.anchorfan.com/image/babelcopter-takes-off-again-with-ryan-babel-reckons-adam-may-be-on-his-way-59191.html |archivedate=31 August 2013 |title='BabelCopter' takes off again, and Ryan Babel reckons Adam may be on h |publisher=Anchorfan |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Premier League players to use Twitter to communicate with fans, in January 2011, Babel posted a [[photoshop]]ped image on Twitter of referee [[Howard Webb]] in a [[Manchester United]] shirt following Liverpool's 1–0 defeat to United in the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. He was subsequently charged by [[The Football Association|the F.A.]] with improper conduct and fined £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/863846/fa-charges-ryan-babel-for-webb-based-photo-joke?cc=5739 |title=FA charges Babel for Webb tweet |date=10 January 2011 |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, Liverpool agreed a fee believed to be in the region of £7&amp;nbsp;million for Babel from [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8267227/Liverpool-accept-Hoffenheim-bid-for-unsettled-winger-Ryan-Babel.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, [[Kenny Dalglish]] said that Babel would be staying at Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/01/24/2320776/kenny-dalglish-confirms-ryan-babel-is-staying-at-liverpool |title=Kenny Dalglish confirm Ryan Babel is staying at Liverpool |date=24 January 2011 |website=Goal.com |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the next day Babel flew to Germany to finalise the deal to sign with Hoffenheim.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/70077.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1899 Hoffenheim===
On 25 January 2011, it was confirmed that Babel had left Liverpool to join German side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim for a reported fee of £8 million, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8281942/Ryan-Babel-leaves-Liverpool-for-Hoffenheim-two-and-a-half-year-contract.html |title=Ryan Babel leaves Liverpool for Hoffenheim two-and-a-half-year contract |date=25 January 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first competitive match was on 26 January 2011 in the [[DFB-Pokal|DFB Cup]] quarter final match against [[FC Energie Cottbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/311815/statistics.html |title=Energie Cottbus 1 – 0 TSG Hoffenheim |date=26 January 2011 |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his 'left little finger out' celebration, in support of disadvantaged youths in Amsterdam.
On 9 April 2011, Babel scored his first goal for Hoffenheim, in a 3–2 loss to [[SC Freiburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/matches/2010/spieltag-29/124995/sc-freiburg-vs-1899-hoffenheim/spielbericht.php |title=Bundesliga – official website |publisher=Bundesliga |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, Babel netted his first league goal of the season on 20 August 2011 against [[FC Augsburg|Augsburg]] in a 2–0 away win. On 10 September 2011, he scored his first brace for 1899 Hoffenheim in a 4–0 win against [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] and scored again in the next game on 17 September in a 3–1 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

After playing for Hoffenheim for 18 months, scoring six goals in 51 matches, he was released by the club on 31 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8036433/Hoffenheim-release-Babel |title=Hoffenheim release Babel |last=Zocher |first=Thomas |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ajax===
After personally buying off the remaining year of his contract with Hoffenheim, he returned to his old club Ajax on a one-year deal. Wearing shirt number 49, the same number he wore when he made his first ever appearance for the first team at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], he made his debut with Ajax for the 2012–13 season on 15 September 2012, in a regular season match against [[RKC Waalwijk]]. He came on as a substitute for [[Derk Boerrigter]] in the second half, assisting [[Jody Lukoki]] on the second goal in the 2–0 home win for the [[Amsterdam]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/31/soccer-dutch-babel-idINL4E8JV7HG20120831 |title=Soccer-Babel agrees one-year deal with Ajax |agency=Reuters |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal since returning to Ajax in a match against ADO Den Haag on 23 September 2012.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Struggling with a slight injury midway through the season, Babel managed to play a total of 16 league matches for Ajax, scoring four goals in total in the [[Eredivisie]]. He also made four appearances in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]], as well as two more appearances in the [[2012–13 KNVB Cup]], where he scored the second goal in the '15-minute of the second round fixture against [[FC Utrecht]], with the match ending 3–0 for the Amsterdam side prior to his injury. He would return to action after being sidelined to help his side secure their 3rd consecutive national title and 32nd overall.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Kasımpaşa===
Opting not to extend his contract with Ajax in order to make way for the next generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=190237 |title=Babel en Malki voor drie jaar naar ambitieus Kasimpasa |publisher=Voetbalzone |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=12 February 2014 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel decided to join Turkish side [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]] where former Ajax player [[Shota Arveladze]] was the current manager. He was joined in Turkey by fellow Amsterdam born defender [[Ryan Donk]] who made the transfer from Belgian side [[Club Brugge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/242146/Kasimpasa-slaat-slag-met-binnenhalen-Babel-en-Donk.htm |title=Kasimpasa slaat slag met binnenhalen Babel en Donk |publisher=Voetbal International |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2013 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Ain===
Babel signed a contract with [[UAE Arabian Gulf League]] champions [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]] to replace the outgoing [[Miroslav Stoch]]. He signed the contract after passing a medical test on 2 July 2015. In December 2015, Al Ain and Babel were involved in a conflict over Babel's disciplinary issues with the club's hierarchy and regarding his use of social media. The club demoted him to the reserves citing poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/ryan-babel-part-of-al-ain-reserve-team |title=Ryan Babel part of Al Ain 'reserve team' |first=Ashwani |last=Kumar |newspaper=Khaleej Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beşiktaş===
In January 2017, Babel joined [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] on a two-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38492178|title=Ryan Babel: Former Liverpool forward joins Turkish side Besiktas |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2017 |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only joining the club in January, Babel became a crucial member of the squad that season, making 18 [[2016–17 Süper Lig|league]] appearances and scoring 5 goals as he helped Beşiktaş secure their fifteenth league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fall-rise-ryan-babel-how-14464244 |title=The fall and rise of Ryan Babel – how the former Liverpool man has rescued his career |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulham===
On 15 January 2019, Babel signed for Premier League club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a contract until the end of the [[2018–19 Fulham F.C. season|2018–19 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2019/january/15/ryan-babel-signs-for-fulham |title=Babel signs for Fulham  |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=15 January 2019 |accessdate=16 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Babel Oranje.jpg|150px|thumb|Babel playing for the Netherlands in August 2007]]

Babel took part in the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. Babel scored two goals in four games as the Netherlands reached the quarter-finals. There they were defeated by Nigeria, 10–9 in a penalty shoot-out (Babel scored his penalty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/netherlands2005/matches/round=91020300/match=91020047/index.html |title=Nigeria 1–1 Netherlands |publisher=FIFA |date=25 June 2005 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that season, Babel made his international debut on 26 March 2005, away against [[Romanian national football team|Romania]]. He entered the game as a first-half substitute for [[Arjen Robben]] and went on to score the second goal in a 2–0 victory.&lt;ref name=fifa/&gt; The goal made Babel the youngest goalscorer in 68 years for the Netherlands&lt;ref name=fifa/&gt; and the fourth-youngest of all time.&lt;ref name=MARCO/&gt; Babel had been a first team regular with Ajax in 2004–05 and finished with seven league goals in 22 appearances.

In 2006, [[Marco van Basten]] included Babel in the Dutch squad for [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Due to a knee injury however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contacttheplayers.com/profiles/ryan-babel/253.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502025215/http://www.contacttheplayers.com/profiles/ryan-babel/253.html |archivedate=2 May 2010 |title=Ryan Babel |publisher=contacttheplayers |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel only featured once, as a second-half substitute for [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] in the group match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/germany2006/matches/round=97410100/match=97410037/index.html |title=Netherlands 0–0 Argentina |publisher=FIFA |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Basten has been quoted as saying Babel "has all the potential to become the next [[Thierry Henry]]".&lt;ref name=MARCO&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2183792.ece |title=Gunners ready to snare Babel, 'the new Henry' |last=Burt |first=Jason |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061523/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2183792.ece |archivedate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Babel was part of the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands under-21 team]] competing in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|UEFA Under-21 Championship]], being held in the Netherlands. In the group stage, Babel scored a penalty against Portugal, helping the Dutch to secure a semi-final spot and thus qualifying for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. His second tournament goal came during his [[man of the match]] performance in the final as the Netherlands defeated [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia]] 4–1 to retain their title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=4/newsid=555143.html |title=Babel pays tribute to best vintage |publisher=UEFA |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629013958/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=4/newsid=555143.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Babel was selected for the Dutch squad which would compete in the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament. On 31 May, it was announced that Babel had been withdrawn from the squad after tearing ankle ligaments in training. Van Basten added then-[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[Khalid Boulahrouz]] to his squad in place of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/netherlands/7429356.stm |title=Injury rules Babel out of Euros |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 May 2008 |date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup===
Babel was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219200542/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg?hl=en |archivedate=19 December 2013 |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager [[Bert van Marwijk]] announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Netherlands reached [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], Babel did not appear in any of the matches during the tournament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Euro 2012===
Babel returned in Oranje after an absence of almost a year on 11 November 2011 as a starter in the pre Euro 2012 0–0 drawn friendly against Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=1715444.html |title=Netherlands draw blank against Switzerland by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com |publisher=UEFA |date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A left-footed player traditionally used as a central defender, he also plays left back.

==Career==
===Youth and college===
Born in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]], Ream was a 2005 NSCAA All-Midwest Region selection with his high school, [[St. Dominic High School (O'Fallon, Missouri)|St. Dominic]], and after finishing his career with 15 goals and a school-record 39 assists, was tabbed All-State, All-Conference and Class 2 Defensive Player of the Year in both 2004 and 2005, was a St. Louis Post-Dispatch All-Metro selection and garnered Archdiocesan Athletic Association Player of the Year honors following senior season.

During his college years Ream also played for [[Chicago Fire Premier]] in the [[USL Premier Development League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/teams/13381239/22315-13381307/10355035.html |title=United Soccer Leagues (USL) |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711123416/http://www.uslsoccer.com/teams/13381239/22315-13381307/10355035.html |archivedate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Red Bulls===

|quote="He has a future. I probably shouldn't say too much, but Ream has a chance to be a national team player. He's a center back who is comfortable and calm in possession of the ball. He plays a good passing game, he's an excellent passer. A European-type center back who, I think, reminds me of Rio Ferdinand in the Premier League. Ream is strong tactically and never stressed, and of course he's good in the air. He has a top-class attitude and spirit."
|source= -Red Bulls coach [[Hans Backe]] speaking about Tim Ream, March 17, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/red-bulls-coach-likes-one-young-defender-in-particular/ |work=The New York Times |first=Jack |last=Bell |title=Red Bulls Coach Likes One Young Defender in Particular |date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ream was drafted in the second round (18th overall) of the [[2010 MLS SuperDraft]] by [[New York Red Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mlsnet.com/mls/events/superdraft/2010/draft_tracker.jsp 2010 MLS SuperDraft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117173019/http://web.mlsnet.com/mls/events/superdraft/2010/draft_tracker.jsp |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His play during pre-season impressed many observers, including new coach Hans Backe who was pleased with his distribution and tactical awareness.

On March 20, 2010, Ream started and played the full 90 minutes for Red Bulls in a 3–1 victory against [[Santos FC]], which was the first match played at the new [[Red Bull Arena (Harrison)|Red Bull Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php?article_id=22956 |title=THE STARTING XI Salou, Kandji partner up top |publisher=Bigapplesoccer.com |date=March 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201611/http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php?article_id=22956 |archivedate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on March 27, 2010, playing the full 90 in New York's opening game of the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010 MLS season]] against [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] that ended in a 1–0 victory for New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/gamecast?id=289679&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=USA.1 |title=Gamecast: New York Red Bulls v Chicago – Major League Soccer – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=March 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2010, he scored his first professional goal (and MLS goal) against the [[Colorado Rapids]] in a 3–1 win for [[New York Red Bulls]]. Ream ended his first professional season starting all 30 matches for New York and helped New York capture its second regular season [[2010 Major League Soccer|Eastern Conference]] title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/red-bulls-beat-revs-clinch-eastern-conference ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023070503/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/red-bulls-beat-revs-clinch-eastern-conference |date=October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon the conclusion of the 2010 season, he was named the team's Defender of the Year, and he was one of three listed candidates for [[MLS Rookie of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/10/12/new-york-red-bulls-2010-mls-season-awards-contenders |title=New York Red Bulls 2010 MLS Season Awards Contenders |publisher=New York Red Bull Official Website |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701205837/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/10/12/new-york-red-bulls-2010-mls-season-awards-contenders |archivedate=July 1, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/11/19/red-bulls-announce-2010-team-awards |title=Red Bulls announce 2010 team awards |publisher=New York Red Rulls Official Website |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322023644/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/11/19/red-bulls-announce-2010-team-awards |archivedate=March 22, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Ream's second season in New York, he played and started in 28 of 34 matches during the regular season; he missed 6 matches largely due to international call-ups during the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

In December 2011, during the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] off-season, Ream spent a short time training with both [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] with permission from the Red Bulls to maintain his fitness during the winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2074044/West-Brom-Bolton-warned-Tim-Ream.html |title=West Brom and Bolton warned off Tim Ream &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=December 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of January 2012, Bolton made a transfer offer of £2.5m for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Trotters move for American |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7415635/Bolton-launch-Ream-bid |title=Bolton launch Ream bid &amp;#124; Latest Football Transfer News |publisher=Sky Sports |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was accepted and after personal terms were agreed he received a work permit on January 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Holden welcomes arrival of fellow USA international |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11672/7452668/Ream-granted-work-permit- |title=Ream 'granted work permit' &amp;#124; Bolton Wanderers News, Fixtures, Results, Transfers |publisher=Sky Sports |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the start of the 2012–13 season, Ream was given the number 5 shirt, previously worn by [[Gary Cahill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-announced-5.6.12-217943.aspx |title=Squad Numbers Announced |publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227211807/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-announced-5.6.12-217943.aspx |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given his first start of the 2012–13 season in a 2–0 loss against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burnley 2 – 0 Bolton Wanderers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221523 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=August 18, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was sidelined from the first team, due to losing his starting place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/glad-to-be-back-22.10.12-439687.aspx |title=Glad To Be Back |publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024221419/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/glad-to-be-back-22.10.12-439687.aspx |archivedate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was relegated to the substitutes bench.

He began his career at [[FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] in 2009, spending two years at the club before a £6.5 million transfer to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]].

Schürrle played one-and-a-half [[Premier League]] seasons at the English club before joining [[VfL Wolfsburg]] for £22 million in January 2015, winning the [[DFB-Pokal]] and [[DFL-Supercup]] in his first year.

Schürrle has been a full international for Germany since 2010, gaining over 50 caps and scoring 20 goals. He was a member of the German squads which reached the semi-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. During extra-time in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] he provided the assist for [[Mario Götze]]'s winning goal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].

'''Håvard Nordtveit''' (born 21 June 1990) is a Norwegian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] for Fulham and the [[Norway national football team|Norway national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/sport/fussball/bundesliga/vereine/gladbach/2010/12/30/martin-stranzl-und-havard-nordtveit/sind-endlich-borussen.html |title=Stranzl und Nordtveit sind endlich Borussen |publisher=Bild |language=German |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010 | first = Christian | last = Hornung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Norway===
Nordtveit began his career as a youth in Norway with Vats 94 and Skjold. On 20 August 2006 he became the youngest player ever to play for [[FK Haugesund|Haugesund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-avis.no/article/20060822/SPORT/108220002 |title=Slipper Nordtveit til landslaget |publisher=Haugesund Avis |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204171720/http://www.h-avis.no/article/20060822/SPORT/108220002 |archivedate=4 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was selected for the starting line-up in a 2–0 victory against [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] at [[Haugesund stadion|Haugesund Stadium]]. He made nine league appearances during the [[Norwegian First Division 2007|following season]] for Haugesund in the [[Norwegian First Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifs.no/personprofil.php?person_id=19752 |title=Nordtveit factfile – Norwegian &amp; International Statistics of Football |publisher=Nifs.no |accessdate=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season he also appeared in the [[Norwegian Football Cup 2007|Norwegian Football Cup]], being in the starting line up in the 1–6 victory against Djerv 1919 (1st round),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altomfotball.no/element.do?cmd=match&amp;matchId=107582&amp;tournamentId=110&amp;seasonId=329 |title=Djerv 1919 - Haugesund |work=altomfotball |publisher=TV 2 |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coming on in the 33rd minute in a 4–0 victory over [[Løv-Ham Fotball|Løv-Ham]] scoring one goal (third round).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifs.no/kampfakta.php?kamp_id=257026&amp;land=1&amp;t=14&amp;u=2336 |title=Match Statistics – Norwegian &amp; International Statistics of Football |publisher=Nifs.no |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haugesund went all the way to [[2007 Norwegian Football Cup Final|the final]].

===Arsenal===
[[Arsène Wenger]] travelled to Norway on 11 June 2007 to watch an Adeccoligaen match and begin negotiations to sign Nordtveit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotballmagasinet.no/?mode=news&amp;id=8169 |title=Arsene Wenger overvåket Håvard Nordtveit, og Haugesunds hjemmeseier |publisher=FotballMagasinet.no |first=Sten Christian |last=Kvindesland |accessdate=15 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204100534/http://fotballmagasinet.no/?mode=news&amp;id=8169 |archivedate=4 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the FKH board stated that the club had rejected Arsenal's initial bid. The player himself said that his club was asking for a "supernaturally high" transfer fee. The price being quoted in the Norwegian media was 20 million [[Norwegian krone]]r &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Øystein Eide |url=http://www.h-avis.no/article/20070611/SPORT/106110022/1062 |title=Er ikke 20 millioner nok? |publisher=Haugesunds Avis |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204171715/http://www.h-avis.no/article/20070611/SPORT/106110022/1062 |archivedate=4 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately £1.7 million at the time). A transfer fee was later finalized on 3 July 2007 for £500,000 initially, rising to £2m after 40 first team appearances.&lt;ref name=Feature /&gt;
He was thereafter given the shirt number 55 by the club.

Haugesund captain [[Kevin Nicol]] and former Norway coach [[Nils Johan Semb]] went on to praise him as the brightest defensive talent in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youngguns.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/havard-nordtveit-brightest-defensive-talent-in-europe/ |title=Håvard Nordtveit, Brightest Defensive Talent In Europe? |publisher=Youngguns.wordpress.com |date=19 February 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304123309/http://youngguns.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/havard-nordtveit-brightest-defensive-talent-in-europe/ |archivedate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his Arsenal debut in their first pre-season friendly against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 14 July 2007.
Nordtveit came on after half-time, replacing [[Kerrea Gilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0708pre-season-barnet-0-2-arsenal-match-report|title=Barnet 0-2 Arsenal|website=Arsenal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named captain of Arsenal's [[Arsenal F.C. Reserves|reserve squad]] for the first match of the [[2007–08 Premier Reserve League|2007–08]] [[FA Premier Reserve League]] season. In an interview with Arsenal.com, Nordtveit said he was "honoured" to have been named captain, and that he hoped to continue in that role in the future.&lt;ref name=Feature&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleacherreport.com/amp/2248347-former-arsenal-young-gun-havard-nordtveits-second-chance-at-gladbach.amp.html|title=Former Arsenal Young Gun Havard Nordtveit's 2nd Chance at Gladbach|website=Bleacher Report.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final game of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season he was named on the substitutes' bench in Arsenal's 1-0 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7381801.stm|title=Sunderland 0-1 Arsenal|website=BBC.co.uk|date=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
On 18 August 2008, [[UD Salamanca|Salamanca]] of the [[Segunda División]] signed him on a six-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en/amp/news/8/main/2008/08/19/825027/arsenal-defender-loaned-to-salamanca|title=Arsenal Defender Loaned To Salamanca|website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At Salamanca he played alongside another young [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player, [[Pedro Roberto Silva Botelho|Pedro Botelho]]. He came off the bench to make his debut for UD Salamanca as they drew 1-1 with [[Sevilla Atlético]] in the second fixture of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com.ng/match?gameId=254121|title=UD Salamanca 1-1 Sevilla Atlético|website=ESPN FC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal recalled him on 29 October, after becoming unhappy with the amount of playing time the Norwegian had received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/ibergen/article2348443.ece |title=Blir i Arsenal til jul |publisher=Nettavisen.no |date= 30 October 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2009 | language = Norwegian | first = Ørjan | last = Nilsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not eligible to play for the club until 1 January 2009. On 21 January, he finally made his first appearance for the reserves since spending time on-loan at UD Salamanca, in a 2–2 draw against the [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] reserves. 

On 10 March 2009, [[Norwegian Premier League]] outfit [[Lillestrøm SK|Lillestrøm]] signed Nordtveit on loan until 1 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Another Young Gun goes on loan"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Adams |title=Another Young Gun goes on loan |url=http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/Football/2009/03/10/Premier-League-Nordtveit-joins-Lillestrom/gnid-43850/ |publisher=Setanta Sports |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314041330/http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/Football/2009/03/10/Premier-League-Nordtveit-joins-Lillestrom/gnid-43850/ |archivedate=14 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the [[Eliteserien (football)|Norwegian Premier League]] in Lillestrøm's season opener away against [[Stabæk Fotball|Stabæk]] as a right fullback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/sport/fotball/stabaek---lillestrom-spark-for-spark-1.6525047|title=Poengdeling i serieåpningen|language=Norwegian|website=NRK.no|date=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was a role which he retained during his time with the Norwegian side.

====2009–10 season====
On 28 July 2009, [[1. FC Nürnberg]] agreed a one-year loan deal for the Norwegian defender from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sport.msn.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/512037/artikel_Havard-Nordtveit-kommt-zum-Club.html | title = Havard Nordtveit kommt zum Club | language = German | publisher = sport.msn.de | date = 28 July 2009 | accessdate = 3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a centre-back, his primary role at [[1. FC Nürnberg|Nürnberg]] was in the defensive midfield position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/nordtveit-i-can-follow-in-bould-s-footsteps | title = Nordtveit – I can follow in Bould's footsteps | publisher = arsenal.com | date = 3 August 2010 | accessdate = 3 October 2012 | first = Chris | last = Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feature@ /&gt;

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===
On 30 December 2010, Nordtveit joined [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] on a three-and-a-half-year contract, the transfer fee was £800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-why-i-will-let-nordtveit-leave|title=Wenger&amp;nbsp;— Why I will let Nordtveit|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|date=31 December 2010|first=Chris|last=Harris|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut for the club on 15 January 2011 in their [[Bundesliga]] match against Nürnberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/nurnberg-vs-mgladbach/220857|title=Match Report|website=Sky Sports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordtveit scored his first goal in Germany, against [[1. FC Köln]] in a 5–1 victory for Borussia Mönchengladbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2010-11/29/1013496/spielanalyse_borussia-mgladbach-15_1-fc-koeln-16.html|title=Gladbach 5-1 Koln|language=German|website=Kicker.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was used mostly as a defensive midfielder, and established himself as a key player for Gladbach, taking the departed [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]]'s place in the squad.&lt;ref name=Feature@&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/havard-nordtveit-west-ham-bound-ball-winner-who-arsenal-could-regret-letting-go|title=Havard Nordtveit: The West Ham-bound ball winner who Arsenal could regret letting go|website=Four Four Two.com|date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
On 16 May 2016, it was announced that Nordtveit would be joining [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 1 July 2016 on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/west-ham-united-havard-nordveit-borussia-monchengladbach-free-transfer|title=West Ham sign Havard Nordtveit from Borussia Mönchengladbach|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2016-05-16|last1=Association|first1=Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his official debut for the ''Hammers'' on 28 July in a 2–1 defeat to [[NK Domžale]] in the first leg of a [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] qualifying match, playing the full 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/nk-domzale-vs-west-ham/362689|title=Hammers lose in Slovenia|website=Sky Sports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoffenheim===
On 20 June 2017, West Ham announced that Nordtveit had signed for German side [[TSG Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]], for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2017/june/20-june/havard-nordtveit-signs-hoffenheim|title=Havard Nordtveit signs for Hoffenheim|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=West Ham United}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Nordtveit was a regular for the Norway U-17 in qualifying and they barely missed out on a place at the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2007 European Championships]].  After that he was promoted to the U-19 squad and was ever-present during the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification|2009 European Championship qualifying]], scoring twice, but once again Norway did not make it past the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship elite qualification|elite qualification stage]]. He has been a regular for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|U-21]] team in the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification Group 7|2011 European Championship]] qualifying campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U21-TROPP TIL EM-KVALIK I SERBIA |publisher=[[Football Association of Norway|fotball.no]] |url=http://www.fotball.no/Landslag_og_toppfotball/Landslag/Aldersbestemt_gutter/U20/2009/U21-tropp-til-EM-kvalik-i-Serbia/ |date=2 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802114729/http://www.fotball.no/Landslag_og_toppfotball/Landslag/Aldersbestemt_gutter/U20/2009/U21-tropp-til-EM-kvalik-i-Serbia/ |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first international appearance on 7 June 2011, in a friendly game against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].

'''Luciano Darío Vietto''' ({{IPA-es|luˈsjano ðaˈɾi.o ˈβjeto|am}};{{efn-ua|In isolation, ''Darío'' and ''Vietto'' are pronounced {{IPA-es|daˈɾi.o|}} and {{IPA-es|ˈbjeto|}} respectively.}} born 5 December 1993) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], on loan from [[Atletico Madrid]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Vietto was born in the small town of Balnearia in the [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Province of Córdoba]]. He joined his local team Independiente de Balnearia at the age of seven.

At the age of 15, Vietto joined [[Argentine Primera División]] club [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pensionpincha.blogspot.ca/2008/04/luciano-vietto.html|title=Pensión de Estudiantes de La Plata: Luicano Vietto|trans-title=Board of Estudiantes de La Plata: Luciano Vietto|publisher=Pensión Del Pincha|language=es|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was released two years later. He subsequently moved to [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]'s youth academy, after a failed trial at [[Rosario Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1515212-vietto-la-joya-de-racing-que-estuvo-cerca-de-dejar-el-futbol|title=Vietto, la joya de Racing, que estuvo cerca de dejar el fútbol|trans-title=Vietto, Racing's pearl, who almost left football|publisher=Cancha Llena|language=es|date=7 October 2012|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racing Club===
In 2011 Vietto signed his first professional contract, and was called up to the main squad by manager [[Diego Simeone]] on 25 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/racing/Vietto-creer_0_578942367.html|title=Vietto para creer|trans-title=''Vietto'' to believe|publisher=[[Olé (sports newspaper)|Olé]]|language=es|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on a day later, coming on as a late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 1–1 home draw against [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espndeportes.com/futbol/cronica?id=325703&amp;league=ARG.1|title=Racing igualó con Lanús y está más lejos de Boca|trans-title=Racing draws with Lanús and is farther of Boca|publisher=[[ESPN Deportes]]|language=es|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietto was handed his first start on 3 September 2012, scoring his first professional goals (and his first [[hat-trick]]) in a 3–1 home success over [[San Martín de San Juan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espndeportes.com/futbol/cronica?id=352350&amp;league=ARG.1|title=Racing le ganó a San Martín y quedó a un punto de Boca|trans-title=Racing defeated San Martin and ended up a point behind Boca|publisher=ESPN Deportes|language=es|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a regular starter under [[Luis Zubeldía]] and contributed with 13 goals during [[2012–13 Argentine Primera División season|the campaign]], as his side only finished fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/168277/luciano-vietto?season=2012|title=Luciano Vietto – 2012 season|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attracting interest from European clubs such as [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2201987/Liverpool-eye-Argentinian-starlet-Luciano-Vietto.html|title=Liverpool rival Juventus for Argentinian starlet Vietto|website=[[Daily Mail]]|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietto signed a four-year contract extension with Racing on 26 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingclub.com.ar/plantel/nota/2013/03/1241_vietto-acordo-la-extension-de-su-contrato-con-el-club/|title=Vietto acordó la extensión de su contrato con el club|trans-title=Vietto agreed to a contract extension with the club|publisher=Racing Club's official website|language=es|date=26 March 2013|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietto appeared in 35 matches in [[2013–14 Argentine Primera División season|2013–14]], scoring five times. Highlights included a brace in a 3–1 away win against [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimansia La Plata]] on 2 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/futbol/cronica/_/id/373353|title=Racing logró su segundo triunfo en fila frente a Gimnasia|trans-title=Racing achieved its second successive triumph against Gimnasia|publisher=ESPN Deportes|language=es|date=2 November 2013|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maxime Le Marchand''' (born 11 October 1989) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

==Club career==
===Youth career===
Le Marchand was born in the port city of [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany and began his youth football career with his hometown club, [[US Saint-Malo|Saint-Malo]]. In 2000, he joined the prestigious youth academy of [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. Upon arriving at the club, Le Marchand initially joined as a [[Midfielder|left-sided midfielder]], but eventually moved to the [[left-back]] role. After ascending the youth ranks, he added the [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]] position into his arsenal often playing both positions in dual roles. Between 2006 and 2008, he was frustrated by injuries to his ankle, but was still able to celebrate Rennes's capturing of the under-18 championship for the 2006–07 season, and the [[Coupe Gambardella]] in 2008 alongside his Rennes teammates [[Yann M'Vila]], [[Damien Le Tallec]], and [[Yacine Brahimi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stade-rennais-online.com/Maxime-Le-Marchand.html Maxime Le Marchand]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Michaël Seri''' (born 19 July 1991) is an Ivorian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivorian national team]].

==Club career==
===Early career in the Ivory Coast===
In his native Ivory Coast, the young Seri was nicknamed "Galla", because he tried to emulate the former [[AS Monaco|Monaco]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain]] midfielder [[Marcelo Gallardo]], whose technical skills he admired. Seri joined the Ivorian football academy that was opened in 2001 by the Ivorian footballer [[Cyril Domoraud]]. "Jean is gifted, intelligent and respectful," Domoraud said in retrospect. "In his young days, he was one step ahead of the others, thanks to his ball control."&lt;ref name="JeanSeriESPN5AUg2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal target Jean Seri destined for big move after Nice displays|url=http://www.espnfc.com/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/3172560/arsenal-target-jean-seri-in-line-for-big-move-after-nice-displays|work=ESPN|date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Born in the south-western city of [[Grand-Béréby]], Seri began his career as a youth player with [[Abidjan]] club [[Africa Sports d'Abidjan]] in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean-Michaël Seri at FootballDatabase.eu|url=http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.joueurs.jean-michael.seri.134057.fr.html|work=FootballDatabase.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best clubs in Ivory Coast fought for his services. In January 2010, Seri started his career as a senior player by joining [[ASEC Mimosas]], the most successful club in Ivorian football, where he needed just one season to prove himself and become one of the best players in the country. "He is a great listener, and his state of mind is impeccable," raved Sébastien Desabre, ASEC Mimosas's head coach from October 2010 to October 2012 when Seri was a senior player there, and that quality enabled Seri to make steady progress.&lt;ref name="JeanSeriESPN5AUg2017"/&gt;

===Porto===
On 2 November 2012, Seri joined [[Primeira Liga]] club [[FC Porto]] on loan, after impressing their scouts. However, there was no place for Seri in the club's first team. He was thus forced to play for the club's [[FC Porto B|reserve team]], scoring once in 19 [[2012–13 Segunda Liga|Segunda Liga]] matches in the first five months of 2013.&lt;ref name="JeanSeriESPN5AUg2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/fc-porto/detalhe/dragoes-garantem-jean-michael-seri-786352.html|title=Dragões garantem Jean-Michael Seri|trans-title=Dragons guarantee Jean-Michael Seri|work=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JeanSeri at Soccerway"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean Seri at Soccerway|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/jean-michael-seri/171726/|work=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paços de Ferreira===
On 31 August 2013, two months after finishing his loan spell at Porto (the ''Dragões''), Seri joined another [[Primeira Liga]] club [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira|Paços de Ferreira]] on a permanent basis and on a free transfer by signing a three-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/fc-porto-jean-michel-seri-assina-pelo-p-ferreira/5221d1f984ae24c6a09fc476.html|title=FC Porto: Jean Michel Seri assina pelo P. Ferreira|trans-title=FC Porto: Jean Michel Seri signs for P. Ferreira|work=MaisFutebol|date=31 August 2013|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted for the ''Pacenses'' on 14 September 2013 against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in a [[2013–14 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]] 3–1 away loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zerozero.pt/jogo.php?id=2838079|title=Benfica 3–1 P. Ferreira|trans-title=|work=ZeroZero|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2014, he scored a goal in the 54th minute to register his first competitive goal for Paços de Ferreira in a 3–1 Primeira Liga home win over [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]] to send his side away from the relegation zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zerozero.pt/jogo.php?id=2838213|title=P. Ferreira 3–1 Marítimo|trans-title=|work=ZeroZero|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Paços de Ferreira where Seri's magnificent range of passing and ability to dictate the tempo of the game made him a fans' favourite. The club finished in eighth place in the [[2014–15 Primeira Liga]], and [[Ligue 1]] club [[OGC Nice|Nice]] were quick to sign Seri before bigger clubs took notice.&lt;ref name="JeanSeriESPN5AUg2017"/&gt;

===Nice===
On 11 June 2015, Seri officially joined [[Ligue 1]] club [[OGC Nice|Nice]] for a transfer fee of €1 million.&lt;ref name="JeanSeriESPN5AUg2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seri à Nice, c'est officiel|trans-title=Seri to Nice, it's official|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Seri-a-nice-c-est-officiel/565777|accessdate=19 February 2017|work=L'Equipe|date=11 June 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Michaël Seri : L’Ivoirien signe à Nice|trans-title=Jean-Michaël Seri: The Ivorian signs to Nice|url=http://www.africatopsports.com/2015/06/11/jean-michael-seri-livoirien-signe-a-nice/|website=Africa Top Sports|accessdate=19 February 2017|language=French|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, prior to the opening of the transfer window, the club had announced the "very likely" arrival of Seri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=P. Ferreira: Nice confirma contratação de Seri|trans-title=P.

On 27 September 2015, he scored in the 53rd minute to register his first competitive goal for Nice in a 4–1 Ligue 1 away win over [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]].&lt;ref name="JeanSeri at Soccerway"/&gt;

===Fulham===
In July 2018, Seri joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a four-year deal until 2022 with an option for Fulham to extend the contract by a further year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jean Michael Seri: Fulham sign Ivory Coast international from Nice |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44807027 |accessdate=12 July 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Seri made a total of three appearances for the [[Ivory Coast national under-23 football team|Ivory Coast U-23 team]], all of them at the [[2011 CAF U-23 Championship]] held in Morocco, playing every minute of all their three Group B matches against South Africa, Egypt and Gabon. Ivory Coast finished third in Group B and thus did not qualify for the semifinals.

On 27 February 2014, Seri received his first senior international call up for the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] in an upcoming [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/pacos_ferreira/interior.aspx?content_id=870292 |title=Séri convocado para a seleção costa-marfinense |trans-title=Séri selected for the Ivorians |work=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]] |date=27 February 2014 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305182620/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/pacos_ferreira/interior.aspx?content_id=870292 |archivedate= 5 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was an unused substitute in ''The Elephants''' 2–2 away draw (held on 5 March 2014) against Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2014/03/05/4867900/belgium-draws-with-ivory-coast.html|title=Belgium draws with Ivory Coast 2–2 in WCup warm-up|trans-title=|work=KansasCitySports|date=5 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2015, Seri made his senior international debut in a [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification Group I|2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match]] against [[Sierra Leone national football team|Sierra Leone]], playing the entire match in the 0–0 away draw. Seri played two of Ivory Coast's three [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]] Group C matches. They finished third in Group C and thus did not qualify for the quarterfinals. On 17 November 2015, Seri scored a goal in the 64th minute of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF Second Round|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] second round second leg 3–0 home win over [[Liberia national football team|Liberia]] to register his first senior international goal.

Rico made his senior international debut for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in 2016, and was chosen for [[UEFA Euro 2016|the year's European Championship]].

==Club career==
Rico was born in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]]. He played youth football with [[Sevilla FC]], spending several of his first seasons as a senior with [[Sevilla Atlético|the reserves]], in [[Segunda División B]]. On 1 July 2013, he signed a new two-year deal with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sevilla.abc.es/deportes/orgullodenervion/noticias/sevilla-fc/sergio-rico-renueva-contrato-hara-pretemporada-primer-equipo-sevilla.html|title=Sergio Rico renueva dos años y hará la pretemporada con el primer equipo|trans-title=Sergio Rico renews for two years and will make the pre-season with the first team|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|last=Parejo|first=Jaime|language=es|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2014, profiting from the injuries of both [[Beto (footballer, born 1982)|Beto]] and [[Mariano Barbosa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2141413.html|title=Beto, Barbosa present Sevilla with keeping crisis|publisher=UEFA|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rico made his first-team – and [[La Liga]] – debut, starting in a 2–0 home win against [[Getafe CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-divisi%C3%B3n/match/402605/sevilla-fc-getafe/report|title=Sevilla FC 2–0 Getafe|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|date=14 September 2014|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first appeared in the [[UEFA Europa League]] four days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a home success over [[Feyenoord]] for [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|the same scoreline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000587/match=2014444/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Quick-fire Sevilla catch Feyenoord cold|publisher=UEFA|date=18 September 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Rico was definitely promoted to the main squad, overtaking Barbosa in the pecking order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2014/12/03/futbol/equipos/sevilla/1417600813.html|title=Sergio Rico sí se queda|trans-title=Sergio Rico does remain|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|last=Quintero|first=Fede|language=es|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his contract with the ''Rojiblancos'' on the 16th, signing until 2017 and being awarded a place with the first team in the following campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2014/12/16/primera/1418761563_417689.html|title=Sergio Rico renueva hasta 2017|trans-title=Sergio Rico renews until 2017|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|last=López|first=José María|language=es|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished [[2014–15 La Liga|the campaign]] with 37 appearances all competitions comprised, including 11 in the Europa League&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2015/05/26/futbol/equipos/sevilla/1432631495.html|title=Consejo de héroes|trans-title=Council of heroes|newspaper=Marca|last=Fernández|first=Alberto|language=es|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded with a 3–2 win over [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in [[2015 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]].&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3099823/Dnipro-2-3-Sevilla-Carlos-Bacca-scores-twice-La-Liga-survive-scare-retain-Europa-League-crown-earn-Champions-League-spot-dramatic-win-Warsaw.html|title=Dnipro 2–3 Sevilla: Carlos Bacca scores twice as La Liga side survive scare to retain Europa League crown and earn Champions League spot with dramatic win in Warsaw|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Keegan|first=Mike|date=27 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2015–16 La Liga|2015–16]], Rico played in Sevilla's [[UEFA Champions League]] [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|group stage elimination]], but was replaced by fellow youth graduate [[David Soria]] as the team [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|went on to win]] a third consecutive Europa League title.&lt;ref name=THREE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000663/match=2017222/postmatch/report/index.html#sevilla+make+three+liverpools+expense|title=Sevilla make it three in row at Liverpool's expense|publisher=UEFA|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was still first-choice during [[2017–18 La Liga|2017–18]], but was also involved in altercations with manager [[Vincenzo Montella]] and a group of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/deportes/futbol/2018-04-07/sergio-rico-sevilla-montella-aficion-fallos_1545414/|title=Sergio Rico y su insostenible situación en el Sevilla por el pulgar abajo de la afición|trans-title=Sergio Rico and his unsustainable situation at Sevilla for the supporters thumbs down|newspaper=[[El Confidencial]]|last=Sánchez-Flor|first=Ulises|language=es|date=7 April 2018|access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2018, Rico was loaned to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for [[2018–19 Premier League|one season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sevillafc.es/actualidad/noticias/sergio-rico-se-marcha-cedido-al-fulham-fc|title=Sergio Rico se marcha cedido al Fulham FC|trans-title=Sergio Rico goes out on loan at Fulham FC|publisher=Sevilla FC|language=es|date=9 August 2018|access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut on 27 October, in a 0–3 home loss against [[AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45924057|title=Fulham 0–3 AFC Bournemouth|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|last=Holland|first=Kris|date=27 October 2018|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 26 May 2015, Rico and Sevilla teammate [[Aleix Vidal]] were the two players called up to the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] for the first time, ahead of a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] and a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualifying match]] against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beinsports.tv/soccer/article/8fmekfgmj7141sxmbdb6mijvl/title/sevilla-duo-sergio-rico-and-aleix-vidal-handed-spain-calls|title=Sevilla duo Sergio Rico and Aleix Vidal handed Spain calls|publisher=[[beIN Sports]]|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not play in either fixture. He was the third-choice goalkeeper for the final tournament behind [[Iker Casillas]] and [[David de Gea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36312769|title=Euro 2016: Diego Costa, Juan Mata &amp; Fernando Torres not in Spain squad|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut on 1 June, [[Substitute (association football)|replacing]] the former for the final 14 minutes of a 6–1 friendly win over [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/video-spain-6-1-south-korea-highlights-salzburg-friendly-ahead-euro-2016-2376728|title=VIDEO Spain 6–1 South Korea: Highlights from Salzburg friendly ahead of Euro 2016|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|last=Le Miere|first=Jason|date=1 June 2016|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In December 2016, Rico was given the Sport award at the Young Andalusia Prizes, receiving his honour from regional president [[Susana Díaz]], a fan of [[Seville derby|city rivals]] [[Real Betis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2016/12/21/primera/1482322835_729608.html|title=Susana Díaz: 'No hay bética que premie tanto a los sevillistas'|trans-title=Susana Díaz: 'There's no Betis fan who bestows so much awards on Sevilla players|newspaper=Diario AS|last=López|first=José María|language=es|date=21 December 2016|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfie Robert John Mawson''' (born 19 January 1994) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Fulham}} club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

He started his senior career with [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] from the youth ranks but spent his entire time on loan with four different clubs, including three separate loan spells with [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]] and winning the [[EFL League Two|League Two]] Player of the Year award with [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in 2015. He was transferred to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] after failing to record a League appearance with Brentford, and made 49 appearances during the one season there, helping the former to win promotion to the Championship. He signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 2016, and his second season there he featured in every Premier League match of the campaign but could not prevent the team from relegation.

Mawson has made six appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] and was called up for the [[England national football team|England]] squad in March 2018 but did not play in the two friendlies.

'''Lazar Marković''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Лазар Марковић}}, {{IPA-sh|lâzaːr mǎːrkoʋitɕ|pron}}; born 2 March 1994) is a Serbian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]].

He started his career at [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] before moving to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in 2013, where he won a domestic [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in his only season, after which he completed a £20 million move to Liverpool. His second season at Liverpool was spent on loan at [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]], and finished prematurely due to injury. He was then transferred to [[Sporting CP]] on a season-long loan, which was cancelled in January 2017, after which he was loaned to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. In January 2019 he moved to [[Fulham F.C|Fulham]] on a free transfer after not making a competitive appearance for Liverpool since May 2015.

Marković made his full international debut for Serbia in 2012.

===Benfica===
On the morning hours of 10 June 2013, Partizan club president [[Dragan Đurić]] told ''[[Sportski žurnal]]'', "[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] wants to loan Marković to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] for two years, and honestly speaking, I hope to God that they don't come to an agreement so that Lazar can stay six more months at Partizan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=sr:КРАЈ САГЕ: Челзи позајмио Марковића у Бенфику на две године|url=http://www.zurnal.rs/2013/06/10/kraj-sage-celzi-pozajmio-markovica-u-benfiku-na-dve-godine/index.html|work=zurnal.rs|language=Serbian|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was later misinterpreted by several non-Serbian sports news outlets, which incorrectly cited Đurić stating, "It is true, Chelsea will send Marković on a loan for two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partizan Belgrade Claim Chelsea Have Already Signed Serbian Youngster Lazar Markovic|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2013/06/10/partizan-belgrade-claim-chelsea-have-already-signed-croatian-youngster-lazar-markovic/|work=caughtoffside.com|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partizan: Chelsea own Markovic|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/premierleague/story/Partizan-Chelsea-own-Markovic-28825949|work=FOX Sports|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately eight hours after the article was published, Benfica's official website released a statement stating Marković had signed a five-year contract with the club, not mentioning any loan deal with Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazar Markovic contratado pelo SL Benfica por cinco temporadas|trans-title=Lazar Markovic signed by Benfica for five seasons|url=http://aovivo.slbenfica.pt/Noticias/DetalhedeNoticia/tabid/790/ArticleId/30008/language/pt-PT/Lazar-Markovic-contratado-pelo-SL-Benfica-por-cinco-temporadas.aspx|work=S.L. Benfica|language=Portuguese|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier statements regarding a potential loan deal with Chelsea caused great confusion among journalists and followers of the transfer saga alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benfica contradict Partizan, claim they're signed Markovic to 5-year deal|url=http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/6/10/4415428/lazar-markovic-transfer-rumour-benfica|work=weaintgotnohistory.com|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fabricio Agosto Ramírez''' ({{IPA-es|faˈβɾiθjo aˈɣosto raˈmiɾeθ}}; born 31 December 1987), known simply as '''Fabricio''' or '''Fabri''' {{IPA-es|ˈfaβɾi|}}, is a Spanish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

He also competed professionally in Turkey and England, winning the [[Süper Lig]] championship with [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] in [[2016–17 Süper Lig|2016–17]].

==Club career==
===Spain===
Fabricio was born in [[Las Palmas]], [[Canary Islands]]. After being bought at almost 18 from local [[UD Vecindario]], he finished his football formation at [[Deportivo de La Coruña]]. After suspensions to goalkeeping teammates [[Dudu Aouate]] and [[Gustavo Munúa]] due to a post-training punching session,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/01/11/spain.deportivo/index.html Deportivo keepers axed after fight]; [[CNN]], 11 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; he was made first-choice, and made his [[La Liga]] debut on 13 January 2008 in a 3–4 away loss against [[Villarreal CF]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2007_08/primera/jornada_19/vil_dep/index.html Cabeza de turco blanquiazul (White-and-blue Turkish head)]; [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], 13 January 2008 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; in February both offenders were reinstated in the first team, and he returned to [[Deportivo de La Coruña B|the B-squad]].

In January 2008, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] reportedly showed interest in signing Fabri, considered "one of Spain's brightest talents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_3046046,00.html Gunners in Depor starlet link]; [[Sky Sports]], 14 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09 season]] he was definitely promoted to backup duties as Munúa and Aouate were both deemed surplus to requirements, and also [[2008–09 Copa del Rey|appeared]] in the [[Copa del Rey]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://masdeporte.as.com/masdeporte/2008/11/12/polideportivo/1226543103_850215.html El Deportivo pasa y Omar Bravo se estrena como goleador (Deportivo go through and Omar Bravo gets first goal)]; [[Diario AS]], 12 November 2008 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; however, after the [[Israel]]i's move to [[RCD Mallorca]], Munúa was again reinstated as second-choice and Fabricio returned to the reserves.
 
On 13 July 2009, Fabricio was released by ''Depor'', joining [[Real Valladolid]] on a 2+2 contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realvalladolid.es/noticias/actualidad/14072009/Fabricio-apuesta-futuro-porteria/ Fabricio, apuesta de futuro en la portería (Fabricio, bet for future in goal)]; Real Valladolid, 13 July 2009 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August of the following year he signed for [[Recreativo de Huelva]] in [[Segunda División|division two]], on a [[2010–11 Segunda División|one-year]] loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/es/news/21/fichajes/2010/08/19/2078362/mercado-es-oficial-el-recreativo-ficha-a-fabricio-y-descarta Mercado: Es oficial, el Recreativo ficha a Fabricio y descarta a Ibrahima (Market: It's official, Recreativo sign Fabricio and rule out Ibrahima)]; [[Goal (website)|Goal]], 19 August 2010 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabri returned to the top flight for the [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12 campaign]], moving to [[Real Betis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2011/06/22/futbol/equipos/betis/1308748724.html Fabricio se convierte en nuevo guardameta bético (Fabricio becomes new ''bético'' goalkeeper)]; Marca, 22 June 2011 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in 17 overall contests in his first year, keeping [[Shutout|clean sheets]] against [[Real Zaragoza]] (2–0, away),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2011_12/primera/jornada_24/zar_bet/ El Zaragoza compra billete para el infierno (Zaragoza buy a ticket to hell)]; Marca, 20 February 2012 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Málaga CF]] (2–0, also away)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2011_12/primera/jornada_31/mga_bet/ Excesivo castigo en La Rosaleda (Excessive punishment at La Rosaleda)]; Marca, 31 March 2012 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CA Osasuna]] (1–0 at the ''[[Estadio Benito Villamarín]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/es/match/63251/betis-vs-osasuna/report Betis 1–0 Osasuna: Rubén Castro da los tres puntos (Betis 1–0 Osasuna: Rubén Castro gives three points)]; Goal, 15 April 2012 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; however, following a run-in with manager [[Pepe Mel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2012/09/16/futbol/equipos/betis/1347790957.html Mel: "No encuentro sentido a lo que dijo Fabricio" (Mel: "I find no logic in what Fabricio said")]; Marca, 16 September 2012 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; he was demoted to third-choice and eventually left the club in the 2013 summer, returning to Deportivo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/deportivo/2013/08/17/fabricio-regresa-deportivo/00031376741714463829767.htm Fabricio regresa al Deportivo (Fabricio returns to Deportivo)]; [[La Voz de Galicia]], 17 August 2013 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabricio played second-fiddle to [[Germán Lux]] in [[2013–14 Segunda División|his first year]] in his second spell in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2014/06/06/futbol/equipos/deportivo/1402052029.html La afición del Dépor, pendiente de la renovación de Germán Lux (Dépor's faithful, hanging on Germán Lux's renewal)]; Marca, 6 June 2014 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently became the starter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/deportivo/2014/10/22/espina-saco-fabricio-deportivo/00031413998327890884356.htm La «espina» que se sacó Fabricio en el Deportivo («Thorn» off Fabricio's side at Deportivo)]; La Voz de Galicia, 22 October 2014 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the vast majority of [[2015–16 La Liga|2015–16]], however, due to a [[tibia]] injury he originally contracted ten years ago (in 2011, whilst at Betis, he also suffered a potentially career-threatening shoulder ailment).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/deportes/1081980/fabricio/supera/una/lesion/comprometio/su/carrera.html Fabricio supera una lesión que comprometió su carrera (Fabricio overcomes career-threatening injury)]; Diario de Sevilla, 6 October 2011 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/torremarathon/2015/12/05/diez-anos-ligamento-roto/0003_201512H5P46991.htm Diez años con el ligamento roto (Ten years with a ruptured ligament)]; La Voz de Galicia, 5 December 2015 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beşiktaş===
In July 2016, Fabri moved abroad for the first time, signing for Turkish [[Süper Lig]] champions [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş JK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.besoccer.com/noticia/fabricio-dice-adios-al-depor-para-fichar-por-el-besiktas|title=Fabricio dice adiós al Dépor para fichar por el Besiktas|trans-title=Fabricio says goodbye to Dépor to sign for Beşiktaş|publisher=Be Soccer|language=Spanish|date=10 July 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|0–6 loss]] at [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage on 6 December, he began to cry after conceding the fourth goal of the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/champions-league-besiktas-goalkeeper-cries-video-a7460781.html|title=Besiktas goalkeeper Fabricio cries after conceding four first half goals in Champions League|publisher=[[The Independent]]|last=Critchley|first=Mark|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After signing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as a 16-year-old, he only made one competitive appearance for the club before signing with [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]], who loaned him several times for the duration of his contract, including at [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] who acquired him permanently in 2011. He subsequently joined [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], where injury problems saw him feature sparingly until his release; with his next team, [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], he notably won the [[2016 Taça de Portugal Final|2016 Portuguese Cup]].

All youth levels comprised, Fonte earned 69 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], scoring 26 goals.

==Club career==
===Early years / Arsenal===
Fonte was born in [[Lisbon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|23066|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]'s youth system at only nine. In 2006 he signed a three-year contract with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], with a clause stating he was to return to his previous club if the English did not extend the contract beyond the original period.

A regular member of Arsenal's [[Arsenal F.C. Reserves|reserves]], Fonte made his debut for the first team in a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the 2008 pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0809//first-team/barnet-1-2-arsenal-picture-gallery|title=Barnet 1–2 Arsenal|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|date=19 July 2008|accessdate=19 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171026/http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0809//first-team/barnet-1-2-arsenal-picture-gallery|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut for the Gunners as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Carlos Vela]] in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 11 November 2008, a [[2008–09 Football League Cup|3–0 home win]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0809/post/first-team/arsenal-3-0-wigan-athletic-match-report|title=Arsenal 3–0 Wigan Athletic|publisher=Arsenal F.C|first=Chris|last=Harris|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2009, Fonte signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a one-month loan, with his older brother [[José Fonte|José]] playing a big role in persuading club and player of each other's merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7861771.stm|title=Palace sign Arsenal striker Fonte|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=30 January 2009|accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for his new team in a 0–1 home defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on the following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7856654.stm|title=Crystal Palace 0–1 Blackpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 January 2009|accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his loan was subsequently extended until the end of the season;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7929365.stm|title=Crystal Palace extend Fonte loan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace were docked a point and fined £20,000 for fielding him in their final match, despite his loan having expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/01/crystal-palace-point-deducted-rui-fonte|title=Crystal Palace have one point deducted for fielding ineligible Rui Fonte|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamara – Profile with news, career statistics and history – Soccerway|publisher=soccerway.com|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kamara made his [[Ligue 1]] debut for [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] on 12 September 2014 against [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in a 2–1 away defeat. He replaced [[Yannick Carrasco]] after 84 minutes.&lt;ref name="soccerway2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/09/12/france/ligue-1/olympique-lyonnais/association-sportive-monaco-fc/1686787/|title=Lyon vs. Monaco – 12 September 2014 – Soccerway|publisher=soccerway.com|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2015, Kamara signed a three-year contract with [[Belgian Pro League]] side [[K.V. Kortrijk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KV Kortrijk trekt aanvaller van AS Monaco aan|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/cnt/dmf20150706_01764473|website=nieuwsblad.be|publisher=nieuwsblad|accessdate=8 September 2015|language=French|date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to France only six months later, joining [[Championnat National]] side [[Amiens SC|Amiens]] and helping the club to achieve back-to-back promotions up to [[Ligue 1]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/FootballFicheJoueur50513.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goal.com/en/news/strasbourg-amiens-promoted-ligue-1-finale/e1sa45mfsqqj1e1atfw2dz9qi&lt;/ref&gt; Kamara scored the first goal of a dramatic 2-1 win against [[Stade de Reims]] in the last matchday, with Amiens clinching promotion after retaking the lead in the 6th minute of the stoppage time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goal.com/en-tza/match/reims-v-amiens-sc/lineups/bgw7mnm8l1k5uplbpa4r0hre1&lt;/ref&gt; Kamara ended the season as the club's top goalscorer at the [[2016–17 Ligue 2]] with 10 goals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/classementButeurs#sai=100&amp;journee1=1&amp;journee2=38&amp;cat=G&amp;poste=Tous&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulham===
On 31 July 2017, Kamara signed for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract with an option for another 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2017/july/31/kamara-signs|title=Kamara Signs|website=www.fulhamfc.com|date=31 July 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to wear the number 47 so that his initials and number would match [[AK-47]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sofoot.com/aboubakar-kamara-appelez-le-ak-47-446357.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September, Kamara scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41289622|title=Fulham 1–1 Middlesbrough|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 September 2017|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three days later, he scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41315214|title=Nottingham Forest 1–3 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 September 2017|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October, he was sent off for shoving [[Bailey Wright]] off the ball, as Fulham lost 2–0 to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41730389|title=Fulham 0–2 Bristol City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2017|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later scored consecutive braces for Fulham in a 2–2 draw with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and in a 4–1 win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42463026|title=Hull City 2–2 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 December 2017|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42481346|title=Fulham 4–1 Ipswich Town|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 January 2017|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2018, he scored the final goal in a 6–0 win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42671844|title=Fulham 6–0 Burton Albion|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 January 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out to be the last goal he scored for Fulham during the 2017–18 season, as he was used sparingly afterwards, with the rest of his appearances coming off the bench.

On 5 December, Kamara scored his first goal of the 2018–19 season in a 1–1 draw against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46367297|title=Fulham 1–1 Leicester City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 December 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three days later, he scored a consolation penalty in a 4–1 loss to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], after coming on at half-time for [[Aleksandar Mitrović (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409331|title=Manchester United 4–1 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 December 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], Kamara argued with Mitrović over taking a penalty; his effort was saved by [[Jonas Lössl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46656880|title=Fulham 1–0 Huddersfield Town|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 December 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fulham won the match, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was angered by Kamara's decision to take the penalty, stating: "He did not respect me, the club, team-mates and crowd. I spoke with him, it is not right". Mitrović was more forgiving of Kamara, referring to a similar incident he had while playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46711004|title=Claudio Ranieri says he 'wanted to kill' Aboubakar Kamara|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 December 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On New Year's Day, Kamara scored against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], in a eventual 4–1 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46677557|title=Arsenal 4–1 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 January 2018|accessdate=2 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During January, Kamara had another altercation with Mitrović in a yoga session at the club's training ground, and as a result, was left out of the team squad for Fulham's match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11681/11607867/fulhams-aleksandar-mitrovic-and-aboubakar-kamara-in-gym-bust-up|title=Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic and Aboubakar Kamara in gym bust-up|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 January 2019|accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11681/11610910/aleksandar-mitrovic-and-aboubakar-kamara-bust-up-played-down-by-claudio-ranieri|title=Aleksandar Mitrovic and Aboubakar Kamara bust-up played down by Claudio Ranieri|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 January 2019|accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Kamara was arrested at the club's training ground on suspicion of [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and [[Criminal damage in English law|criminal damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/fulham-aboubakar-kamara-arrested-on-suspicion-of-actual-bodily-harm|title=Fulham’s Aboubakar Kamara arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm|work=The Guardian|first=Sachin|last=Nakrani|date=23 January 2019|accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "banned indefinitely from all club activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aboubakar Kamara: Fulham striker arrested on suspicion of ABH and criminal damage |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46978891|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 January 2019|accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
