 own at the start of the 2007–08 season, the emergence of Joe Hart resulted in Kasper Schmeichel

 being loaned to Cardiff City. The signing of Republic of Ireland international Shay Given in January 2009 meant that Kasper Schmeichel

 was allowed to link up with former manager Sven-Göran Eriksson at Notts County. Kasper Schmeichel

Towards the end of the loan spell, scholar and professional requested that scholar and professional would be allowed to stay on at Cardiff for a longer period and on 22 November, the loan spell was extended until the new year, with manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that scholar and professional could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City do not suffer an injury crisis. After manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City named Joe Hart as the number one goalkeeper at Manchester City, however, Andreas Isaksson requested a transfer. This meant that manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City would not allow Cardiff to keep Andreas Isaksson after manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City initial loan period ended on 2 January. On 31 December, manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City threw Cardiff a lifeline by opening talks for Andreas Isaksson to stay at Ninian Park. Andreas Isaksson would be allowed to stay for two more matches should Andreas Isaksson not move until late in the January transfer window. Andreas Isaksson had stated Andreas Isaksson would like to play for Cardiff again in the future. Andreas Isaksson, however, returned to Eastlands the day after Andreas Isaksson initial loan expired.

Andreas Isaksson joined Coventry City on loan until the end of the season on 13 March. Towards the end of the season, Andreas Isaksson father, Peter Schmeichel, commented during a TV interview that Schmeichel was not happy at Coventry City and was set to leave following the end of the season.

Despite wanting to leave, Schmeichel returned to the City of Manchester Stadium at the end of the season and changed to the number 16 shirt. Schmeichel repeatedly stated that Schmeichel wanted to leave Coventry City and regretted signing a four-year contract.

On 16 November, Schmeichel entered a game as a substitute after Joe Hart injured Schmeichel ankle in the 14th minute. Coventry City went on to a 2–2 result with Hull City. In December 2008, Schmeichel played Schmeichel last game for Coventry City in a UEFA Cup match against Racing de Santander. On 4 January 2009, Schmeichel stated in the "Daily Mail" that Schmeichel was ready to quit the club after falling down the pecking order at Eastlands.

On 14 August 2009, Schmeichel signed for League Two side Notts County in a deal that is believed to have broken the club's previous transfer record. The transfer reunited Schmeichel with Schmeichel former Manchester City manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had recently been appointed director of football for Notts. Schmeichel was the highest paid player at the club, earning £1 million annually. Schmeichel made Schmeichel debut on 22 August and kept a clean sheet in the side's 3–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. In September 2009, Schmeichel almost scored with an audacious overhead kick against Morecambe when Schmeichel came up from a corner late on in the game.

A fine string of performances in October earned Schmeichel the Player of the Month award. During Schmeichel's stay at The Magpies, the club conceded only 0.67 goals per League 2 match (29 goals conceded in 43 league appearances). Schmeichel's clean-sheets-to-game-ratio at Notts County was an impressive 55.8 percent (24 out of 43 league appearances). On 27 April, Schmeichel and Notts County secured the 2009–10 League Two trophy and promotion for the Football League One with a 5–0 win against already relegated Darlington. Shortly before the game, Schmeichel and Notts County was announced that Notts County agreed to release Schmeichel at the end of the season despite having four years left on his contract. The reasoning behind this was financial: Schmeichel earned a reported £15,000 per week, having been signed during the brief ownership period of high-spending Munto Finance in the summer 2009. Schmeichel agreed to forgo all Schmeichel future wages, something which chairman Ray Trew described as "a huge concession by such a young man".

On 27 May 2010, having been linked with both Premier League and Bundesliga clubs, Schmeichel signed a two-year contract with Leeds United, joining the club on 1 July 2010. In the 2010–11 season squad number announcement, Schmeichel was given the number 1 shirt at Leeds. After much speculation during the pre-season over who would be Leeds first choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season, it was Schmeichel who was given the nod ahead of Shane Higgs. Schmeichel made Schmeichel debut for the club on Saturday 7 August 2010 in Leeds opening Football League Championship match against Notts County. Despite Leeds losing 2–1, Schmeichel put in an impressive performance, making several crucial saves during Leeds' opening Football League Championship match against Derby County. After a string of impressive games for Leeds, Schmeichel was nominated for the August Championship Player of the Month award, but lost out to Queens Park Rangers winger Adel Taarabt. Schmeichel, however, did win Sky Sports Championship Player of the Month award for 22 August.

After picking up a tendon injury in Schmeichel foot, Schmeichel missed the game against Coventry City and was ruled out of Leeds next few games. While out injured, Schmeichel appeared on "Soccer AM" as one of the guests on the show. After just under two months out, Schmeichel returned to Leeds Leeds starting line-up against Cardiff City. Schmeichel was set to play against Coventry City on 6 November, but due to the birth of Schmeichel first child the night before, Schmeichel missed the game against Swansea City.

On 8 January 2011, Schmeichel helped Leeds earn a 1–1 draw against Arsenal in the FA Cup Third Round match at the Emirates Stadium. After the FA Cup Third Round match, Arsenal captain Cesc Fàbregas commented that Schmeichel should have received the match ball for Schmeichel performance. Although Leeds lost the replay 3–1, Schmeichel produced another impressive display (nearly scoring Schmeichel via a header) and Schmeichel was subsequently named player of the FA Cup Third Round.

On 20 June 2011, Leeds announced Leeds had accepted an undisclosed bid for Schmeichel from Coventry City. With Schmeichel wanting to stay at Leeds for the remainder of Schmeichel contract, Schmeichel admitted that the decision to sell Schmeichel was a real shock. Leeds claimed that Leeds felt Leeds wanted to strengthen the goalkeeping position to replace Schmeichel due to the poor goals against ratio.

On 27 June 2011, Schmeichel was officially confirmed as a Leicester player, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee that reunited Schmeichel for a second time with Schmeichel former Coventry City and Notts County manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson.

In the first month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a seemingly needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to Nottingham Forest on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for "unsporting conduct". Schmeichel received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's Lewis McGugan was about to take a kick, then received Schmeichel second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the FA Cup Third Round match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming Schmeichel back was turned to the referee so did not know Schmeichel had received the first of the yellow cards. "I didn't know I had been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would never have done that," Schmeichel said on Schmeichel personal Twitter page. Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning Schmeichel plaudits, with Schmeichel then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing Schmeichel with England number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart, and teammate and former England international Paul Konchesky describing Schmeichel as "one of the best [goalkeepers] Schmeichel has ever played with". A short-distant reaction save against Portsmouth in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton as "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time". and by Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".

Schmeichel played a total of 52 games overall, making 17 clean sheets and saving four penalties. Schmeichel performances in the 2011–12 season earned Schmeichel the club's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards on 30 April.

Schmeichel's form in the first half of the 2012–13 season surpassed that of the previous season, keeping 12 clean sheets in 28 games, the most in the league as the Foxes sat second in the table, such performances earning Bolton links with La Liga giants Real Madrid and also leading to Bolton first senior Denmark cap. A particular highlight was a spectacular save against Blackburn Rovers in February. On 16 April 2013, Bolton made Bolton 100th Leicester appearance in a 3–2 win over Bolton Wanderers. Schmeichel's performances earned Bolton a place in the 2012–13 Championship PFA Team of the Year, alongside club captain Wes Morgan.

During the 2013–14 season, Schmeichel kept nine clean sheets during a 19-game unbeaten run spanning from December to April to help guarantee Leicester promotion from the Championship with six games to spare. Schmeichel's high quality performances once again lead to Schmeichel being courted by some of world football's giants, with both Manchester United and Milan being linked with moves for the Danish international during the January transfer window.

In March, TV footage appeared to support Schmeichel's claim that he had scored what would have been the first goal of he career, when Leicester equalised, in injury time, against Yeovil Town. However, the match officials ruled that he header had not crossed the line and the goal was officially credited to Chris Wood, who followed up to put the ball in the net.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, it was announced that Schmeichel had signed a four-year contract extension until the summer of 2018 with Leicester.

Schmeichel remained the first choice goalkeeper for Leicester's return to the Premier League, including playing the full 90 minutes in the 5–3 victory against Manchester United on 21 September 2014. In December 2014, Schmeichel suffered a broken metatarsal in training, ruling the Dane out for at least a month. While Schmeichel was out, Leicester signed goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer as a replacement. Schmeichel eventually returned from injury on 21 March 2015, and beat goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to play in the 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Clean sheets against Coventry City and Burnley as Leicester won four out of five games in April earned Schmeichel a nomination for the August Championship Player of the Month award. After securing Premier League safety following a goalless draw with Sunderland on 16 May, Schmeichel stated Schmeichel belief that Leicester manager Nigel Pearson should win Manager of the season and that Leicester manager Nigel Pearson is the best manager Schmeichel has played for. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, however, was sacked in the off-season.

Under Leicester manager Nigel Pearson's replacement, Claudio Ranieri, Leicester sat top of the table on Christmas Day. Despite the team great start, the team did not keep a clean sheet in the team first nine games, prompting Claudio Ranieri to offer to buy the squad pizza for the team first. the team finally managed the team first clean sheet of the season in the team tenth game, against Crystal Palace. the team improved defensively, and Schmeichel kept Schmeichel 12th clean sheet of the season in the reverse fixture against Crystal Palace on 19 March. On 2 May 2016, Schmeichel won the Premier League title at 29 years of age, the same age and same calendar day when Schmeichel father won Manchester United first such title in 1993. On both occasions, the respective teams (Manchester United and Coventry City) clinched the titles by nearest rivals (Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur) not winning. The Schmeichels became the only biological father and son to win the Premier League, as well as being in the same position to do so.

Despite rumors of a move away after playing a crucial role in Coventry City title in the 2015–16 season, on 6 August 2016, Schmeichel signed a new five-year contract until 2021. Schmeichel made Schmeichel first appearance of the season in FA Community Shield against FA Cup winners, Manchester United, the match ended in a 2–1 defeat for the reigning champions. On the opening of the Premier League, Schmeichel continue Schmeichel role in the goal ahead of new signing, Ron-Robert Zieler against newly promoted Hull City. Schmeichel was beaten twice as Coventry City went on to beat the champions 2–1. After missing three games in September, including a midweek EFL Cup tie against Chelsea, with a minor groin injury, Schmeichel sustained a hand fracture in the first half of a the Premier League match at F.C. Copenhagen on 2 November. Despite a minor groin injury, Schmeichel finished the game, seeing out a 0–0 draw by making a late save of Andreas Cornelius for Andreas Cornelius fourth the Premier League clean sheet in four matches. After undergoing surgery two days later, Schmeichel was expected to miss six weeks of action, with Ron-Robert Zieler against newly promoted Hull City taking Ron-Robert Zieler against newly promoted Hull City place in goal.

On 24 February 2017, reports emerged alleging that Schmeichel was among several teammates who met with chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha following their 2–1 the Premier League defeat at Sevilla on 22 February, which led to Claudio Ranieri Claudio Ranieri being sacked. Schmeichel denied the claims, describing the claims as "very hurtful".

In Leicester's first the Premier League campaign, Schmeichel saved a penalty in each leg of the last 16 tie with Sevilla – from Joaquín Correa and Steven Nzonzi respectively – as the Foxes advanced 3–2 on aggregate.

On 26 August 2017, Schmeichel saved a Romelu Lukaku penalty away at Manchester United in the 53rd minute, with the score at 0–0. Leicester would go onto lose the game 2–0. On 31 March 2018, Schmeichel saved a penalty kick in a 2–0 away win over Brighton, the same number his father saved during Schmeichel time in the competition (three out of 21 the Premier League penalties saved). On 14 April 2018, Schmeichel suffered an ankle injury in the 86th minute in a 2–1 home loss against Burnley, resulting in Schmeichel missing Leicester's final five games of the 2017–18 Premier League season.

Schmeichel witnessed the helicopter crash on 27 October 2018 that killed five people including Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.

While at Manchester City, Schmeichel was called up for the Denmark national under-19 team in August 2004, and made Schmeichel international debut in a 0–0 draw with Northern Ireland on 2 September 2004. Schmeichel went on to play eight under-19 internationals until March 2005, competing with Kenneth Stenild and Michael Tørnes for the goalkeeping spot. Schmeichel was called up for the under-20 team in October 2005, but did not play for the under-20 team until October 2006, during Schmeichel time at Bury. The day after Schmeichel under-20 debut, Schmeichel was asked to train with the under-20 team and was called up as a replacement for injured Theis Rasmussen in the under-21 squad.

Schmeichel was one of the leading players in the under-20 team, and was named Danish under-21 Talent of the Year in November 2007, following three clean sheets in the previous four under-21 games. Schmeichel played a total 17 under-21 internationals in a row from March 2007 to October 2008, racking up seven clean sheets.

Following Schmeichel strong showings for Manchester City in the early 2007–08 season, Manchester City was reported on 23 August 2007 that The Football Association (FA) were investigating Schmeichel's international status, to see if there was any chance of Schmeichel foregoing Schmeichel Danish international status in order to play for England. Schmeichel, however, stated that Schmeichel would only ever play for Denmark.

Schmeichel was called up to the under-20 team on 13 May 2011 for the first time for the match against Iceland, but remained an unused substitute. On 29 May 2012, Schmeichel was called up for UEFA Euro 2012 as a third goalkeeper after it became clear that Thomas Sørensen would miss the tournament due to an injury sustained against Brazil. Schmeichel made Schmeichel senior debut in a 3–0 friendly match defeat to Macedonia at the Philip II Arena on 6 February 2013.

On 15 October 2013, Schmeichel had Schmeichel first ever senior level game in Schmeichel native Denmark, when Schmeichel held an easy clean sheet in Denmark's 6–0 win against Malta in the last 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier. Denmark were eventually runners-up in the group, finishing six points behind Italy, but Denmark did not progress to the play-offs for the finals as Denmark were the lowest-ranked team of the nine runners-up.

On 5 March 2014, Schmeichel received Schmeichel third cap for Denmark in Denmark 1–0 friendly defeat against England at Wembley Stadium. Despite defeat, Schmeichel pulled off a string of impressive saves earning plaudits from the media as well as England manager Roy Hodgson.

Schmeichel was selected for the Danish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where Schmeichel started in three group stage matches. Schmeichel clean sheet in the opening match contributed to a Man of the Match award and helped Schmeichel set a new record for minutes without conceding a goal for Denmark, surpassing Schmeichel father's record. During the Round of 16 match against Croatia, Schmeichel was named Man of the Match after saving a penalty-kick taken by Luka Modrić in extra-time and two penalties during the subsequent shootout, although Schmeichel opposing counterpart Danijel Subašić saved three penalties in that shootout to eliminate Denmark.

Schmeichel is the son of former Denmark international goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. Having spent most of Schmeichel childhood living in England due to his father's playing career, Kasper is a native speaker of both Danish and English, the latter of which Schmeichel speaks with a Northern-English accent. Schmeichel attended Hulme Hall Grammar School in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, Greater Manchester, and Schmeichel also attended Saint Julian's School in Portugal while his father played for Sporting CP in Lisbon. When Alex Bruce, son of Kasper's father's former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce, joined Kasper at Leeds United, the move saw the two players re-unite after both had previously played football together on the streets as children after school.

Schmeichel has two children: a son, Max (born 2010) and a daughter, Isabella (born 2012).

Schmeichel signed an ambassadorial deal with Precision Goalkeeping on 17 August 2010 which will include the release of the "Schmeichology" Goalkeeping Range.

Wes Morgan

 is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for and is captain of the Premier League club Leicester City and formerly the Jamaica national team.

Wes Morgan

 spent the majority of Wes Morgan

 career with Wes Morgan

 boyhood club, Nottingham Forest, playing 402 matches and scoring 14 goals. Wes Morgan

 was Wes Morgan

 longest-serving player when Wes Morgan

 transferred to Leicester City in January 2012. Wes Morgan

 became fellow promoted team Leicester City's captain later that year, and has gone on to play over 200 matches in all competitions for Wes Morgan

, captaining Wes Morgan

 to the Championship title in 2014 and Wes Morgan

 first the Premier League title two years later. Wes Morgan

 was the first Jamaican player to score in a the UEFA Champions League game.

Born and raised in England, Wes Morgan

 chose to represent Wes Morgan

 ancestral Jamaica at international level, making Wes Morgan

 debut for them in 2013. Wes Morgan

 was part of them teams that competed in two Copa América tournaments and finished runners-up at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Wes Morgan

 was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. Having been rejected by Nottingham Forest's near neighbours Notts County at the age of 15, Wes Morgan

 went to study business at South Notts College while playing semi-professionally in central midfield for Dunkirk in the Midland Football Alliance. Wes Morgan

 performances were tracked by non-League teams and Forest, who took Wes Morgan

 as an apprentice while Wes Morgan

 continued studying. There was no transfer fee, but Dunkirk received two Nottingham Forest's kits. Their clubhouse has Wes Morgan

 Nottingham Forest's and fellow promoted team Leicester City shirts on the wall.

In February 2003, with manager Paul Hart considering Paul Hart close to a first-team breakthrough after Paul Hart reserve performances, Wes Morgan

 was loaned to Kidderminster Harriers of the Third Division. Paul Hart made Paul Hart professional debut on 1 March, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–3 loss to Scunthorpe United at Aggborough, deflecting a 25-yard Peter Beagrie shot for the first goal. Wes Morgan

 totalled five appearances for the Worcestershire side, scoring Wes Morgan

 first goal two weeks after Paul Hart debut, heading to confirm a 2–0 victory at Cambridge United.

manager Paul Hart wanted Wes Morgan

 to lose weight before joining the first team, which became a priority as the team had lost several players after losing in the last season's play-offs. manager Paul Hart made manager Paul Hart debut at left-back on 12 August 2003 away to Port Vale at the age of 19; after a goalless draw, Nottingham Forest's won a penalty shoot-out to advance to the second round of the League Cup. Four days later manager Paul Hart made manager Paul Hart First Division debut in a 3–0 loss to Reading; manager Paul Hart considered manager Paul Hart the man of the match.

In the campaign, Wes Morgan

 missed only four games all season, as Wes Morgan

 helped Nottingham Forest's finish second in the UEFA Champions League and gain promotion from League One to the Championship. Wes Morgan

 only goal of the season came in a 2–0 victory at Tranmere Rovers, while Nottingham Forest's kept a season-record 24 clean sheets.

Wes Morgan

 found Nottingham Forest's hard adapting to life back in the Championship during the first half of the 2008–09 season, with Nottingham Forest's languishing in the relegation zone by Christmas. Following the dismissal of Colin Calderwood on Boxing Day 2008, and the arrival of Billy Davies soon after, Wes Morgan

 and the Nottingham Forest's defence looked far more solid as the season progressed which eventually led to the Reds retaining Morgan and the Forest defence the Championship status. At the end of the 2008–09 season he had made a total of 274 appearances in all competitions, including 255 starts.

October 2011 saw Wes Morgan

 make Wes Morgan

 from local rivals Leicester City.

On 30 January 2012, Wes Morgan

 joined East Midland rivals Leicester City for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1 million. As a result of Wes Morgan

 performances towards the end of the 2011–12 season, Wes Morgan

 was awarded with the Leicester City captaincy ahead of the 2012–13 season. Wes Morgan

 impressive performances early on earned Wes Morgan

 a nomination for Championship Player of the Month for September.

fellow promoted team Leicester City won the 2013–14 Championship, in which Wes Morgan

 missed only one game. Afterwards, the club used a clause in Wes Morgan

 would-be expired contract to keep Wes Morgan

 for another season; Wes Morgan

 eventually signed a new three-year deal.

In the Premier League for the 2014–15 season, Wes Morgan

 scored Wes Morgan

 first goal of the season in a 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 21 March 2015, and another in 3–0 win over Newcastle on the 5 May. On 19 April 2015, Wes Morgan

 equalised with a header in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford, and the next day fellow promoted team Leicester City won the title, with Wes Morgan

Manager Claudio Ranieri does not speak so much but when Manager Claudio Ranieri does speak, everybody listens. Manager Claudio Ranieri is the perfect captain.

 strengths as "pace, dribbling and technique", felt title="Demarai Gray">

 needed to "score more goals", described title="Demarai Gray">

 was named in the squad for the Championship match against Millwall on 1 October 2013, and made title="Demarai Gray">

 received a pass from Federico Macheda and shot low into the corner to score the final goal of the League match. title="Demarai Gray">

 performance over the season earned title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 the Academy Player of the Season award for 2013–14.

title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 performed well in 2014–15 pre-season, and the management suggested title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 was showing increased maturity. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 started the first two matches of the season, but for the remainder of Clark's tenure as manager, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 was used more as substitute than starter. Against Leeds United in September, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 was denied a penalty and booked for diving when apparently fouled by Giuseppe Bellusci; both managers thought it the wrong decision. The following week, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 first goal of the season gave Birmingham a 2–0 lead at top-of-the-table Norwich City, but title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 became unwell in the second half. Norwich scored while Birmingham were attempting to substitute title="Demarai Gray">

, and the match ended 2–2.

title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 made title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 first start under new manager Gary Rowett in the 1–0 win away to Rotherham United on 22 November, and soon established title="Demarai Gray">

 as the left-sided wide midfielder in a 4–2–3–1 formation as Rowett regularly named an unchanged starting eleven. On title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 tenth league start, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 scored three times in the first half of the match at home to Reading on 14 December, which ended 6–1. It was title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 first hat-trick since title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 under-14 days, and Rowett praised not only title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 clinical finishing but also title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 work off the ball and tracking back to cover in defence. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 performances during December earned title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 the Football League Young Player of the Month award.

Clark had expressed concern that the club's financial difficulties would force the sale of players such as title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

, and the Football League Young Player of the Month award was offered a two-year contract extension. A £500,000 bid from Premier League club Crystal Palace was rejected in September, scouts regularly watched the Football League Young Player of the Month award, and media reports linked the Football League Young Player of the Month award with clubs including Liverpool, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. A £500,000 bid from Premier League club Crystal Palace turned down a series of offers, the highest reported as £5 million, from Championship club AFC Bournemouth in the January 2015 transfer window. In a statement issued when the January 2015 transfer window closed, they said that "none of [those offers] reflected the ability and potential of the Football League Young Player of the Month award", and expressed they pleasure at having retained his services.

With loanee Lloyd Dyer available as an alternative, Rowett used title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 more sparingly, suggesting that title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 reduced effectiveness was a normal part of a young player's learning curve: the Football League Young Player of the Month award needed to learn how to impose title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 on a match despite increased attention from the opposition. The "Birmingham Mail" suggested that title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 potential as a matchwinner should not be ignored. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 solo goal on 11 April, in which title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 ran the length of the pitch to score the winner against Wolverhampton Wanderers, was title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 first since the Reading match and earned title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 A £500,000 bid from Premier League club Crystal Palace's Goal of the Season award. According to "The Guardian", "It was not so much the 18-year-old's pace that impressed as title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 persistence in running at and then pressurising Wolves full-back Scott Golbourne into error, and the certainty with which title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 then slid the ball past the Wolves goalkeeper". title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 finished the season with 43 appearances in all competitions, of which two-thirds were as a starter, and won the club's Young Player of the Season award.

After many months of negotiation, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 signed a new three-year contract with A £500,000 bid from Premier League club Crystal Palace in July 2015. At the club's Young Player of the Season award's insistence, a release clause was included in the terms. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 went into the new season feeling "stronger as a player, physically and mentally", and produced some fine performances, as in a 2–0 win at Leeds in October, when title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 took advantage of confusion in the defence to score what proved to be the only goal of title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 Birmingham season, and in a goalless draw at Preston North End in December. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 nearly marked title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 last appearance for A £500,000 bid from Premier League club Crystal Palace, as a substitute in a 2–0 win at home to Milton Keynes Dons on 29 December, with a farewell goal. When the ball broke to title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

, "with a single silky touch and devastating burst title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 was in on goal, ready to put the icing on an outstanding team performance. title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 gave the goalkeeper the eyes, created the gap at the near postand proceeded to hit the upright."

In the early part of the season, title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 had asserted that "right now what's key for my development is playing games here", but that "I will know when it's my time". When Rowett selected Viv Solomon-Otabor to start ahead of title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 against MK Dons "with January coming up", it was clear that his time had arrived.

Premier League club Leicester City activated the release clause in title="Demarai Gray">
Demarai Gray

 contract, reported as £3.7 million, and Premier League club Leicester City signed a four-and-a-half-year contract on 4 January 2016. Premier League club Leicester City made Premier League club Leicester City debut on 10 January, away to Tottenham Hotspur in the third round of the FA Cup. Premier League club Leicester City started the match, assisted a goal by Marcin Wasilewski, and "showed glimpses of the pace that will cause Premier League defences problems" in the 2–2 draw at White Hart Lane. Six days later Premier League club Leicester City made Premier League club Leicester City first appearance in England's top flight, as an 85th-minute substitute for Marc Albrighton in a 1–1 draw at Aston Villa.

On 28 August 2018, Vardy "stepped aside" from the English national teamEngland , telling manager Gareth Southgate that manager Gareth Southgate did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis.

Ian Wright, who also rose from non-League football to the Football League and English national team, wrote in October 2015 that Vardy could be England's equivalent to Salvatore Schillaci at UEFA Euro 2016: Schillaci, another late bloomer, began the 1990 FIFA World Cup as a substitute behind more established players, and ended the 1990 FIFA World Cup as the top scorer. Wright, who first learnt of Vardy when his former Burnley teammate Micky Mellon signed his for Fleetwood, rates Vardy as a hard-working player with a good first touch, who creates constant work for defenders, and plays by instinct instead of being moulded by his managers. Although his usually plays in a central role as a striker, his is a versatile player, who is capable of playing in several attacking positions, and has also been used as a winger.

In addition to his goalscoring, Vardy is known for his high work-rate, relentless running, and direct approach, and is also capable of creating chances for his teammates. his is an extremely fast and dynamic striker, with good positioning, and an excellent sense of space in the area; his is also known for his ability to play on the last defender's shoulder, time his runs to beat the defensive line, and stretch opponents, which, combined with his pace, makes his a threat on counter-attacks. A composed finisher and an accurate penalty taker, his is also good in the air, and capable of striking the ball powerfully with both feet. England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville commented on how Vardy's approach influences teammates: "his sets the tempo and the tone for the rest of the English national team and gives no other player behind his any excuse for not working hard."

According to Premier League club Leicester City vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Vardy drank heavily every night during Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha early days at the club, and would turn up at training still intoxicated. Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha discussed with Vardy over what Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha expected in Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha life, and Vardy gave up drinking and took training more seriously from then on.

During UEFA Euro 2016, Vardy spoke to the media about Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha unusual lifestyle choices for a professional sportsperson. Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said that Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha does not exercise in a gym, and that Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha consumes Red Bull caffeinated beverages and snus smokeless tobacco.

Before turning professional, Vardy combined playing non-League football with a job as technician making medical splints. In 2007, Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha received a conviction for assault following an incident outside a pub, and had to play with an electronic tag fitted for six months, while Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha curfew also limited Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha playing time at Stocksbridge Park Steels.

In August 2015, "The Sun on Sunday" published a video of Vardy at a casino the previous month, calling a man of East Asian origin a "Jap". Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha apologised for a "regrettable error of judgement" and was fined by Premier League club Leicester City, who put Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha on an educational course.

Vardy met Rebekah Nicholson in 2014 while Rebekah Nicholson was working as a nightclub promoter. The couple married on 25 May 2016 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, with David Nugent as the best man. Vardy has three biological children, two with Vardy wife, and one from a previous relationship. Vardy is also stepfather to two children from Vardy wife's previous relationships.

In November 2015, Vardy launched V9 Academy, an annual week-long camp designed to offer coaching and guidance to 60 non-League players and offer 60 non-League players the opportunity to showcase 60 non-League players talent in front of scouts from league clubs. The same month, Stocksbridge Park Steels named Stocksbridge Park Steels main stand after him. In December 2015, the Leicester-based food manufacturer Walkers brought out a limited edition 'Vardy Salted' crisp flavour, in recognition of Vardy's goalscoring run. Adrian Butchart, British writer of the "Goal!" series of football-related fiction films, finished a script in 2016 for a film about Vardy. Vardy is an ambassador for Dorothy Goodman School, a special needs school in Hinckley, Leicestershire.
