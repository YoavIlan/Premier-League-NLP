After success with the club's under-18 team, Lloris was promoted to the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football, for the 2004–05 season. Lloris alternated the starting goalkeeper spot with Hilaire Munoz as Lloris appeared in 12 matches. Lloris was promoted to the first team squad ahead of the 2005–06 season and assigned the number 1 shirt. Lloris was designated by manager Frédéric Antonetti as the team's starting goalkeeper for the club's Coupe de la Ligue campaign ahead of fan-favourite (and fellow Nice native) Damien Gregorini, who was relied more upon in league play. Lloris made Lloris professional debut on 25 October 2005, at the age of 18, recording a clean sheet in Nice's 2–0 Coupe de la Ligue win over Châteauroux.

Despite the disappointing finish, the club for Nancy was the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals. Only veterans Grégory Coupet, Cédric Carrasso and Ulrich Ramé conceded fewer. For the early part of the 2007–08 season, Lloris endured a recurring ligament injury in Lloris left knee, which forced Lloris to miss three weeks in September. Lloris returned to the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals on 6 October 2007 in a league match against Le Mans, but was substituted out after 71 minutes after the injury relapsed. Lloris missed a further six weeks before returning on 24 November in the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals's 2–1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain.

Lloris efforts that season led to Lloris being approached by several big European clubs with hopes of signing Lloris for the future.

After another solid season with Nice, speculation arose as to where Lloris would play the following season. Lloris was primarily linked to French club Lyon, who wanted Lloris to replace the departing Grégory Coupet, Milan, who wanted Lloris to replace the Brazilian Dida, and Tottenham Hotspur, who wanted Lloris to replace Paul Robinson. After reportedly coming to personal terms with Milan, Lloris snubbed the Italian club for seven-time Ligue 1 champions Lyon. Milan vice president Adriano Galliani later declared that an agreement had been all but reached stating that Lloris was "practically ours", but the deal reached a stumbling block when Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati refused a move to Palermo. Lloris explained Lloris decision citing Lyon's European ambitions, more playing time at Lyon, and in Milan, Lloris was not guaranteed the starting goalkeeper spot. The transfer fee was initially undisclosed, but was later discovered to be priced at €8.5 million. Lloris was promptly handed the number 1 shirt and also the starting goalkeeper position.

Despite Lyon losing out on the title for the first time in seven years, Lloris finished the campaign conceding only 27 goals in the league and recording 16 clean sheets; both of which were second-best to only Cédric Carrasso. Lloris was, subsequently, named the league's top goalkeeper and also named to the Team of the Year.
In the 2009–10 season, Lloris remained the club for Nancy's first-choice goalkeeper and opened the new campaign by recording four clean sheets in the club for Nancy's first eight matches. For Lloris performances in the month of September, Lloris was awarded the UNFP Player of the Month becoming the first goalkeeper since Steve Mandanda in August 2008 to receive the award. Lloris earned media praise for Lloris performances against Liverpool in the league. In the first match, played at Anfield, Lloris made four saves holding Liverpool to only one goal. Lyon won the match 2–1. In the second match at the Stade Gerland, Lloris produced stops from shots by Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt and Andriy Voronin in the first half, then displayed reflexes to deny the Brazilian Lucas midway through the second period. Though Lyon conceded late, the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals drew the match 1–1 with a goal from Lisandro López in injury time.

On 8 November 2009, Lloris, alongside Marseille and France's number two goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, each conceded five goals in a thrilling 5–5 draw between Lyon and Marseille, though most of the goals conceded were attributed to "slack defending" displayed by both clubs as described by the media and both managers.

Lyon later achieved qualification to the quarterfinals in the competition after drawing 1–1 in Madrid with Lloris conceding the opening goal to Cristiano Ronaldo in the sixth minute. It was the goalkeeper's first goal conceded in over 620 minutes. On 2 May, Lloris provided the assist on the game-winning goal scored by Michel Bastos in Lyon's 1–0 win over Montpellier.

Following the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals's 3–0 win over Lens the following week, in which Lloris earned Lloris first clean sheet in over a month, Lloris reflected on Lloris comments after the Nice match, stating, "It was a human reaction. There was frustration and accumulation and It had to come out. It was intolerable to draw 2–2 when leading 2–0."

Lloris signed for Tottenham Hotspur on 31 August 2012 for €10 million and €5 million variable. Lyon also receives 20% of Lloris's future transfer profit.

Following speculation linking Lloris with a move to Monaco, Lloris insisted Lloris had left Lyon to play abroad. On 3 November 2013, in a match against Everton, Lloris lost consciousness in a collision with Romelu Lukaku's knee, but remained in the game after manager André Villas-Boas determined Lloris "showed great character and personality". The decision was heavily criticised by head injury charities, FIFA and the players' union, FIFPro.

Lloris signed a five-year contract extension in July 2014. Lloris said that Mauricio Pochettino, the new manager at Tottenham, had convinced Lloris to sign the new contract with Lloris "rigour and vision" that gave the club for Nancy "new benchmarks".

On 22 November 2016, Lloris saved Radamel Falcao's 11th-minute penalty and pulled off multiple world-class saves, including incredibly tipping Kamil Glik's powerful volley from five metres out over the bar in the 68th minute, in their 2016–17 UEFA Champions League group stage match away at AS Monaco; however Tottenham lost the match 1–2 and were eliminated from the competition.

In December 2016, Lloris signed a contract extension to remain at Tottenham until 2022.

Erik Lamela

Erik Manuel Lamela (; born 4 March 1992) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for English club Tottenham Hotspur

 and the Argentina national team.



 began 

 career at River Plate and in 2011 transferred to Roma for an initial €12 million. After two Serie A seasons 

 joined Tottenham for a fee of £25.8 million. A full international since 2011, 

 was part of the Argentine squad which finished as runners-up at the 2015 Copa América.

After 

 had joined River Plate as a seven-year old, Barcelona reportedly offered Lamela and 

 family £100,000 a year, as well as a house and employment for 

 parents, to move to the city of Barcelona, in a similar deal to the one that saw Lionel Messi move to Spain as a youngster. In 2004, a "Trans World Sport" film crew travelled to Argentina to interview a 12-year-old Lamela who was already making headlines after scoring 120 goals for River Plate youth side the previous season. In the video, Lamela declares Lamela wish to follow in the footsteps of Diego Maradona and win a World Cup for Argentina.

Lamela made Lamela first team debut for River Plate on 14 June 2009 in a game against Tigre for the 2009 Clausura tournament. Lamela entered the field on the 80th minute, substituting Robert Flores. Lamela scored Lamela first goal for River on 5 December 2010 in a match against Colón for the 2009 Clausura tournament. Lamela scored Lamela second goal against Lanús in the final fixture of that Apertura, helping River win a match against Colón for the Apertura tournament 4–2.

The midfielder was a regular starter for River during the 2010–11 Argentine Primera División season, playing 34 games and scoring four goals. The midfielder helped The midfielder to finish in an overall sixth place that would have qualified his first team for the 2011 Copa Sudamericana. Due to the relegation format of the Argentine Primera that accounts a team's last three seasons, however, River was relegated after losing a playoff with Belgrano.

On 6 August 2011, Lamela joined Italian club Roma of Serie A for a fee of €12 million, plus €2 million in bonuses, which was activated after Lamela 20th club appearance. Roma also paid an additional €3.2 million to Orel B.V. — plus 10% added value if the player was later sold above €12 million — and €3.06 million in the form of taxes to the Government of Argentina. Lamela signed a 5-year contract worth €1.8 million in gross in the first season, but would gradually increase by €350,000 on 1 July 2012 (to €2.15M), 2014 (€2.5M) and 2015 (€2.85M). On 23 October 2011, Lamela scored Lamela first goal in Serie A against Palermo. Later, Lamela scored goals against Lecce, Novara, and Cesena. Lamela ended Lamela first season at the Stadio Olimpico with six goals in 31 games in all competitions.

Lamela began the 2012–13 season well, Lamela first goal of the season coming against Bologna on 16 September 2012. Lamela hit a superb patch of form in October and early November, scoring seven goals in six games, including a brace against Udinese in a 3–2 home defeat and goals against Atalanta, Genoa, Parma, and Palermo. Lamela also scored a goal in the Derby della Capitale against Lazio. After almost a month out with an ankle ligament injury, Lamela returned to the field and scored a brace against Milan in a 4–2 victory on 22 December.

Lamela went on to score 15 times in 33 games, putting Lamela joint-fifth in Serie A and second to striker Pablo Osvaldo (16 goals) at Roma. Lamela's and Roma season, however, ended in heartache with defeat to Rome rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final, coupled with finishing sixth in Serie A, meaning that Roma would not play European football for the second consecutive season.

On 30 August 2013, Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur

 completed the transfer of Lamela from Roma for a deal worth an initial £25.8 million, plus up to £4.2 million in bonus payments. The fee for Lamela made Lamela the most expensive player in the club's history, breaking the two previous records that had been set earlier in the transfer window, first for Paulinho and then Roberto Soldado.

On 1 September, Lamela made Lamela debut for Tottenham as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1–0 North London derby loss to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. On 19 September, Lamela made Lamela first start for Tottenham against Tromsø IL in the UEFA Europa League, assisting Jermain Defoe for Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at White Hart Lane. On 22 September, Lamela assisted Paulinho's stoppage-time winning goal after appearing as a substitute in Tottenham's 1–0 win at Cardiff City.

On 29 October, with Lamela having yet to start a Premier League match, Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas said of the player, "Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas knows Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas isn't producing half of what Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas can produce, but Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas understands the situation now is that Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas has to compete for Tottenham manager André Villas-Boas place." On 7 November, Lamela scored Lamela first goal for the club in a 2–1 the UEFA Europa League win against Sheriff Tiraspol. Seventeen days later, Lamela made Lamela first start in Premier League as Tottenham were beaten 6–0 by Manchester City. Lamela season was ended by a back injury in April 2014.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham's new Argentine manager, Lamela was named in the starting line-up for the opening match of the 2014–15 Premier League season against West Ham United, making Lamela first appearance of 2014. On 21 August, Lamela appeared from the bench in Spurs' the UEFA Europa League match at AEL and assisted goals for Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane to secure a 2–1 win against the Cypriot club. Lamela then recorded two more assists in a 4–0 win over Queens Park Rangers three days later at White Hart Lane.

Lamela scored Lamela first goals of the season on 23 October, a brace in a 5–1 victory over Greek club Asteras Tripoli in Premier League. Lamela first goal was a rabona-style strike from outside the area, the goal being praised by the BBC as brilliant and by ITV as "world-class." Lamela scored Lamela first Premier League goal on 20 December in a 2–1 win against Burnley at White Hart Lane.

Lamela's first goal of the 2015–16 season came in a 3–1 the UEFA Europa League win over Qarabağ FK on 17 September 2015. On 26 September, Lamela scored Lamela first Premier League goal of the season in a 4–1 home victory over Manchester City. Lamela scored Lamela first career hat-trick as Tottenham thrashed Monaco 4–1 in Premier League on 10 December.

Lamela scored with a second half header on the opening day of the 2016–17 season in a 1–1 draw against Everton at Goodison Park. However, a hip injury in late October left Lamela unfit for matches for a long period and ended Lamela season.

After more than a year out due to the hip injury that required two operations, Lamela appeared in Premier League away game against Leicester on 28 November 2017 as a substitute. Lamela assisted in the only goal for Spurs, but game against Leicester on 28 November 2017 as a substitute ended in a 2–1 loss. Lamela followed that up with Lamela first league start of the season in a 2–0 home win against Brighton on 13 December 2017. Lamela scored Lamela first goal of the season in the 2–0 win against Newport County in the fourth round replay of the FA Cup on 7 February 2018.

On 20 July 2018, Lamela signed a new four-year extension to Lamela contract with Tottenham until 2022.

Lamela scored Lamela first goal of the 2018–19 season after coming on as a substitute in the game against Liverpool that Spurs lost 2–1. Lamela also scored in the next league game against Brighton in a 2–1 win, followed by another goal in the next game in the EFL Cup against Watford. On 3 October, Lamela scored Tottenham's second goal in a 4–2 defeat at home to Barcelona in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage; it was the 8,000th goal in the history of Premier League. Lamela made Lamela first league start of the season in the away match against West Ham United, scoring the only goal that secured a 1–0 win.

Lamela took part in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup with the Argentina national under-20 team and scored three goals in four matches.

Lamela made Lamela debut with the Argentina national team on 25 May 2011 in a friendly game against Paraguay.

On 3 September 2014, Lamela scored Lamela first goal for the senior national team, putting Argentina 2–0 ahead against Germany, in an eventual 4–2 win in a rematch of the World Cup final.

In May 2015, Lamela was selected by coach Gerardo Martino in Argentina's squad for the 2015 Copa América held in Chile.
