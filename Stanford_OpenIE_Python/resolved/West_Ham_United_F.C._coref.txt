Łukasz Fabiański

Łukasz Fabiański (; born 18 April 1985) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club West Ham United and the Poland national team.

Having begun his career at Legia Warsaw, Fabiański joined Arsenal for £2.1 million in 2007, and was mainly used as back-up, but played as the club won the 2014 FA Cup Final. On the expiration of his contract in 2014, his joined Swansea.

A full international for Poland since 2006, Fabiański has represented Poland on over 40 occasions and was included in the squads for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. his played every match for Poland at Euro 2016 after the first group match with Northern Ireland due to first-choice goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny's injury.

Fabiański was born in Kostrzyn nad Odrą. After starting his career with Polonia Słubice, Fabiański joined the noted independent football academy MSP Szamotuły at age 14, where his honed his footballing skills. Fabiański then was signed in the 2004–05 season by Lech Poznań.

In the winter of 2005, Fabiański was signed by Legia Warsaw, where his competed with Artur Boruc for a place in the team. After Boruc was sold to Celtic, Fabiański took over as starting goalkeeper on 24 July 2005 in a match against Arka Gdynia, which ended 0–0. The following season, Fabiański helped Legia win the 2005–06 Ekstraklasa. Fabiański started all 30 matches of the campaign, in which Fabiański conceded 17 goals.

In the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, Fabiański performances led to Fabiański being awarded the "Football Oscar" for the best goalkeeper in the 2005–06 Ekstraklasa.

On 8 May 2007, Fabiański underwent medical tests in London after Arsenal agreed a transfer fee with Legia Warsaw worth approximately £2.1 million. The move was confirmed on 11 May 2007 by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger. Fabiański formally signed for Arsenal on 26 May with a long-term contract. Fabiański made Fabiański debut for the club in a 2–0 League Cup win over Newcastle United on 25 September 2007.

In Fabiański's early Arsenal career, two of Fabiański most notable appearances came in the 5–1 defeat to rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the 2007–08 League Cup semi-final and the first leg of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League second round match with Porto. Fabiański received criticism for conceding soft goals in the Porto match as Fabiański scored an own goal and was blamed for the second goal after picking up a backpass from Sol Campbell, with Porto scoring from the resulting free-kick. In January 2010, Arsène Wenger stated that Łukasz Fabiański could become one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League.

Łukasz Fabiański played the last four matches for Arsenal in the 2009–10 season after top-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia suffered a wrist injury. top-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia was criticised for conceding soft goals in the defeats to Wigan Athletic and Blackburn Rovers, but kept clean sheets in the matches at home to Manchester City and Fulham.

Fabiański started the 2010–11 season as Arsenal's second-choice goalkeeper. On 21 September 2010, Fabiański made Fabiański first start of the season in a League Cup match against neighbours Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, which Arsenal won 4–1 after extra time. Fabiański cost the match for Arsenal as Fabiański failed to stop Robbie Keane's long-range effort, despite getting a hand to the shot. After the match, Fabiański revealed Fabiański was disappointed. Fabiański had a solid match in Fabiański second match of the season replacing the injured Manuel Almunia one week later in a UEFA Champions League 3–1 away win against Partizan. Fabiański saved Cléo's second penalty of the match in the second half to deny Partizan a lifeline. Fabiański later turned Ivica Iliev's effort around the post from point-blank range just before the final whistle. Arsène Wenger later commented that Fabiański had a "faultless" match and Fabiański finally saw the player who Fabiański usually see in training. Arsène Wenger kept Arsène Wenger first clean sheet in a win over Manchester City, where Arsène Wenger made many saves in a match that ended 3–0. Arsène Wenger was later named man of the match on an Arsenal.com poll after a brilliant display to keep Arsenal in the match. After the City match, Arsène Wenger admitted Arsène Wenger could well become the club's number one goalkeeper after impressive displays in the matches since the Partizan match.

On 7 November 2010, Fabiański was widely criticised for an error that lead to the only goal as Arsenal lost at home to Newcastle United. However, Arsène Wenger produced a strong display to keep a clean sheet in the next Premier League match, against Wolverhampton Wanderers, in which Arsène Wenger managed to prevent a draw with a last-minute save, and then initiating a counter-attack with a long throw of the ball that led to another Arsenal goal. After the Wolves match, Arsenal played Everton, where Fabiański received the man of the match award from Sky Sports.

Fabiański was injured for Arsenal's crucial match with Manchester United but returned for the equally important match with London rivals Chelsea, making many crucial saves in helping Arsenal to win 3–1. On 5 January 2011, Fabiański suffered a season-ending shoulder injury as Fabiański was warming up with the help of Wojciech Szczęsny, which ruled Fabiański out for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. During this period, Szczęsny established Fabiański as Arsenal's first choice goalkeeper ahead of Fabiański Polish compatriot.

Fabiański spent the 2011–12 season as backup to Wojciech Szczęsny, making Fabiański first appearance against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup.

On 6 December 2011, Fabiański was selected to start in Arsenal's UEFA Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos, but was substituted out after 25 minutes following a knee injury.

Injuries limited Fabiański's appearances during the 2012–13 season, where 

 made only five Premier League appearances as back-up to Wojciech Szczęsny. In March 2013, after Wojciech Szczęsny was dropped, Fabiański started in goal in the second-leg of Arsenal's UEFA Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. Fabiański kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2–0 and retained Fabiański place in the team to make Fabiański first Premier League start of the season away against Swansea City on 16 March 2013, again keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. Fabiański started in Arsenal's next three league matches against Reading, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City. However, an injury sustained in the match against Norwich by Fabiański allowed Szczęsny to return to the starting line-up and reclaim Szczęsny position as first-choice goalkeeper.

During the 2013–14 season, Fabiański was used as Arsenal's starting goalkeeper in FA Cup and League Cup matches, with Szczęsny remaining first-choice in Premier League and UEFA Champions League matches.

On 19 February 2014, Fabiański came on as a substitute in the 37th minute of a 2–0 Champions League home defeat against Bayern Munich, after Szczęsny was sent off for a foul on Arjen Robben. With Szczęsny suspended, Fabiański was in the starting line-up for the second leg and saved a late penalty from Bayern's Thomas Müller.

On 12 April, Fabiański saved penalties from Gary Caldwell and Jack Collison in an FA Cup semi-final shootout victory over Wigan Athletic. Fabiański made Fabiański only Premier League appearance of the season in the last match on 11 May, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win that caused Fabiański opponents Norwich City to be relegated. Six days later, Fabiański started for Arsenal in the 2014 FA Cup Final as Fabiański defeated Hull City 3–2 after extra time at Wembley Stadium.

On 29 May 2014, Fabiański was announced that Fabiański would join fellow Premier League side Swansea City on a free transfer when fellow Premier League side Swansea City Arsenal contract expired on 1 July. fellow Premier League side Swansea City said of a free transfer, "The main reason I came to Swansea was because I want to be the number one goalkeeper." fellow Premier League side Swansea City made fellow Premier League side Swansea City competitive debut for the club on 16 August, a 2–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first match of the Premier League season. On 7 December 2014, Fabiański was sent off in Swansea's 1–3 loss at West Ham United for a foul on Diafra Sakho.

On 11 May 2015, Fabiański kept a clean sheet and was named man of the match in a 1–0 win against Arsenal on Fabiański return to the Emirates Stadium. On 6 July, Fabiański signed a new four-year contract with Swansea, which would keep Fabiański at the club until June 2019.

Fabiański played all 38 of Swansea's Premier League games of 2017–18 and was voted Player of the Season by the club's supporters. Fabiański performances did not prevent the club from ending the season 18th and His performances were relegated to the Championship.

On 20 June 2018, Premier League club West Ham United announced the transfer of Fabiański for £7 million. Fabiański signed a three-year contract with the club. Fabiański, the first Pole to play first-team football for West Ham, was installed as first-choice 'keeper at the start of the 2018–19 season.

Having represented Poland regularly at under-21 level, Fabiański's performances for Legia Warsaw saw Fabiański soon making Fabiański debut for the senior international team in a friendly against Saudi Arabia on 29 March 2006.

Fabiański was included in Poland's squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, serving as back-up to Artur Boruc and Tomasz Kuszczak. During the qualifying campaign for the UEFA Euro 2008, Fabiański made one appearance, playing all 90 minutes in Poland's 2–2 away draw against Serbia on 21 November 2007. In September 2008, Fabiański replaced the suspended Artur Boruc for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Slovenia. Fabiański also played in another qualifying match against San Marino in April 2009.

Despite going into UEFA Euro 2016 as an understudy to Wojciech Szczesny, an injury in the first game of the tournament led to Fabiański becoming first choice for the rest of the tournament. Fabiański went on to keep clean sheets in both of the remaining group games against World champions Germany and Ukraine. Fabiański then kept Fabiański place as Poland defeated Switzerland in the Round of 16 before losing to eventual winners Portugal on penalties.

In 2006, Felipe Anderson was moved to Federal FC, and later to Sport Clube Recreativo Gaminha FC. After some impressive performances on the club, Felipe Anderson was moved to Paraná to play for Astral EC, finishing the Year. In 2007, Felipe Anderson was moved to Coritiba youth side, and then in 2007 summer Felipe Anderson was moved to Santos.

Felipe Anderson then played for Santos youth categories, and was promoted to the senior squad following a rash of injuries in October 2010. Felipe Anderson began training with the senior side and signed a professional contract until July 2013. Felipe Anderson made Felipe Anderson debut for Santos on 6 October 2010 as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–0 win against Fluminense.

On 9 February 2012, Felipe Anderson scored Felipe Anderson first goal of the season, against Botafogo-SP.

On the 31 January 2013, the agreed transfer to the Italian club Lazio for €7.5 million failed due to late arrival of a necessary international fax from Brazil to close the deal.

On 25 June 2013, the Italian club Lazio agreed a €7.8 million fee with Santos, and Felipe Anderson signed a five-year deal worth €800,000 a year. Santos received 50% of the transfer sum and the third part owner Doyen Sports would get the rest. the Italian club Lazio's sporting director Igli Tare criticized the third part owner Doyen Sports for numerous times delaying the transfer, “the transfer will remain in history as the most paradoxical and shocking negotiations I have ever been a part of,” said Tare. “These third party owners changed These third party owners minds continually. When we had everything decided, These third party owners would start from scratch two hours later. It all happened for a full week, so it felt like being in the Twilight Zone."

In his second season at the club, Felipe Anderson achieved 10 goals and nine assists in 27 games across all competitions by April 2015. This included the concluding goal as the Italian club Lazio defeated Varese 3–0 in the fourth round of the season's Coppa Italia, and an assist in both legs of the tournament's semi-final against holders Napoli, the one in the second leg providing the winning goal by Senad Lulić.

On 8 August, Felipe Anderson appeared in the Italian club Lazio's 2–0 defeat to Juventus in the 2015 Supercoppa Italiana. On 23 September 2015, Felipe Anderson scored Felipe Anderson first goal of the season in a 2–0 victory against Genoa. After scoring the second goal in a 3–1 Europa League win against Rosenborg on 22 October 2015, Felipe Anderson scored twice in a 3–0 win against Torino three days later. In February 2016, the Italian club Lazio publicly denied rumours that West Ham United had agreed a transfer for Felipe Anderson. Felipe Anderson finished the Italian club Lazio's season with nine goals in all competitions, coming runner-up to Antonio Candreva in the Italian club Lazio's scoring charts for the season.

After being the subject of reported interest from Chelsea during the summer, Felipe Anderson remained with the Italian club Lazio.

 came back to Club Atlético River Plate 30 June 2012. 

 jumped to the pitch as a starter on the team's first appearance in that tournament, scoring the team's only goal in the 1–2 loss against Belgrano de Córdoba. For his comeback, 

 asked to use the club's iconic number 10 shirt to the coach Matías Almeyda, who allowed the player to do so. Nevertheless, during Almeyda's leadership Lanzini was not able to assure 

 a place in the pitch, sometimes watching the matches from the bench or not forming part of the main team.

Almeyda was finally fired and the club's most successful coach to that date, ex Inter Milan player Ramón Díaz was appointed as team manager. With Almeyda, Lanzini's chance of regaining a place as a starter increased. Coach made a strong bet on Manuel Lanzini, putting Coach as a starter in the team's 2–0 victory against San Martín (SJ) and Manu corresponded scoring one of the two goals. Coach was then considered a regular starter for the team.
During the 12th date of the Torneo Final 2013 tournament, Coach was able to score Coach first goal in the Superclásico, one of the most heated football rivalries in the world, in the 1–1 draw against Boca Juniors; this goal, as of 2018, stands out as the fastest goal in the derby's history (43 seconds). River would end up in 2nd place in the Torneo Final of the season.

During the preseason facing the Torneo Final from the 2013 season, the club received an offer from the Baniyas from United Arab Emirates, but the player turned down an offer from the Baniyas from United Arab Emirates because, citing the player own father, the player considered to prioritize the player professional sporting career over economic opportunities. the player remained one of the team highlights in both Torneo Inicial 2013 and international cup Copa Sudamericana 2013 during that year, but the overall form of the team was inconsistent and thus Club Atlético River Plate did not win any trophies in that year.

Things would be different for the club in 2014. that year proved to be one of the most memorable year's in club's history, winning the Torneo Final 2014 and the Copa Sudamericana 2014 kicking out Boca Juniors from that international competition. Manuel Lanzini remained half of the year as part of the team, so Manuel Lanzini was part of the Torneo Inicial 2014 trophy; during that time Manuel Lanzini continued to be one of the most important players in the pitch.

This match stood out in particular because This match was the one that definitively launched the career of his teammate Ramiro Funes Mori, a defender who scored a header in the last minutes of the match; his would end up also playing in the Premier League, as Lanzini, for Everton FC. Club Atlético River Plate would end up being Torneo Final 2014 champion, with a very solid performance from Manu, who scored 2 goals in 18 appearances.

Prior to the beginning of local 2014 Torneo de Transición Championship and international Copa Sudamericana 2014, 6 August 2014 he transferred to the Al-Jazira Club of the Premier League, for US$6.000.000, with a salary amounting to US$12.000.000 in 3 years.

 opened up about the situation, stating that during Gallas final year at Arsenal, Samir Nasri

 was one of "four or five" Arsenal players who did not speak to the defender. The feud culminated on 20 November 2010 when Samir Nasri

 lived up to a pledge Samir Nasri

 would not shake the hand of Gallas, who was then playing for Tottenham Hotspur, during the pre-match build-up.

In the 2008–09 season, Samir Nasri

 appeared in only three matches with the team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost a year and a half. During the 2009–10 season, Samir Nasri

.

On 9 August 2014, at age 27, Samir Nasri

 confirmed France manager Didier Deschamps decision to retire from international football.

In France manager Didier Deschamps early years at Marseille, Samir Nasri

 was deployed in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily on the right side as France manager Didier Deschamps was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park. After two years of developing France manager Didier Deschamps physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Samir Nasri

 into the playmaker role, where Samir Nasri

 vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited Samir Nasri

. Since the 2009–10 season, Samir Nasri

 has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. the young player has personally said that playing centrally is the young player preference. As a result of Samir Nasri

 versatility, Samir Nasri

 can also function on the wing and spent the majority of Samir Nasri

 career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. Samir Nasri

 close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Samir Nasri

 in the role during the young player's four-year stay at the club. Samir Nasri

 often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.

In 2009, in order to accommodate the arrival of Russian attacker Andrey Arshavin, it was recommended by both former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club and then-France national team coach Raymond Domenech that Samir Nasri

 revert to Samir Nasri

 role as a deep-lying midfielder so the young player could showcase Samir Nasri

 underrated defensive abilities. Samir Nasri

 is also an underrated direct free kick and penalty kick taker. the young player had previously developed a superstition with regards to taking spot kicks, but conquered the issue after successfully converting two penalties in the team's League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2010. former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club describes Samir Nasri

 as a "young, quick and technically outstanding player". former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club is described in a similar fashion by club scout Gilles Grimandi, who stated that Samir Nasri

 is "a fantastic athlete, former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club's quick, flexible and good with former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club feet". Samir Nasri

's playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to Zinedine Zidane. After joining Arsenal and excelling on the wing, the English media began comparing former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club to former club player and compatriot Robert Pires.

Bonds played William Arthur Bonds MBE (born 17 September 1946) first three seasons as a right-back before Ron Greenwood switched William Arthur Bonds MBE (born 17 September 1946) to midfield in the 1970–71 season where William Arthur Bonds MBE (born 17 September 1946) counterbalanced the skills of Trevor Brooking. Bonds was at William Arthur Bonds MBE (born 17 September 1946) peak in the early 1970s, helping West Ham to the semi-final of the Football League Cup in the 1971–72 season, where they lost to Stoke City after a second replay, and topping the scorers list at West Ham in the 1973–74 season with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against Chelsea. After the departure of Bobby Moore in March 1974, Bonds was appointed to the captaincy and led the club to an the Football League Cup final victory over Fulham in 1975 and to the final of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup despite a groin injury that interrupted the latter half of the 1974–75 season and part of the 1975–76 season. Ron Greenwood moved Bonds from midfield to the back four as centre-half alongside Tommy Taylor shortly before the end of the 1976–77 season, where he was able to come out from defence with the ball.

he experienced relegation with West Ham at the end of the 1977–78 season but led West Ham to a second the Football League Cup victory over First Division club Arsenal in 1980, becoming the only West Ham captain to lift the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup on two occasions. In 1980–81, he led West Ham to the final of the League Cup, which was lost to Liverpool after a replay, and to promotion back to the Isthmian League Division One North.

Bonds passed Bobby Moore club record of appearances in 1982–83 and 'officially' retired in May 1984, relinquishing the captaincy to Alvin Martin. A spate of injuries to first-team players saw Alvin Martin return to the squad and make 26 league and cup appearances in 1984–85. Alvin Martin missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a toe injury but, having passed Alvin Martin 40th birthday, Alvin Martin was able to re-establish Alvin Martin in the first-team during the 1986–87 season. A knee injury that forced Alvin Martin out of the last two games of the 1987–88 season led to a decision to finally retire in the summer of 1988, having played Alvin Martin last game at Southampton in April 1988 at the age of 41 years and 226 days.

Bonds had remained at the club as a player for over 20 years, scoring 48 goals in a club record 663 League appearances. He established He as a local hero and was the supporters' choice for 'Hammer of the Year' in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1987. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in January 1988 and was presented with the PFA Merit Award in April 1988 by He fellow professional players. In May 2013 Bonds was awarded West Ham United's first ever lifetime achievement award.

On 6 February 2019 it was announced that the East Stand at The London Stadium will be renamed the Billy Bonds Stand. The unveiling took place ahead of West Ham home fixture against West Ham United on 2 March.

Bonds was capped twice at England Under-23 international level and was on the bench as a non-playing substitute for the senior international team for a World Cup qualifying match against Italy in November 1977. A collision with goalkeeper Phil Parkes in the last game of the 1980-1981 season broke two of Bonds ribs, and ruled Bonds out of selection for England against Brazil in May 1981. Bonds and Alvin Martin were in line to make Bonds and Alvin Martin England debuts in A collision with goalkeeper Phil Parkes in the last game of the 1980-1981 season.

After Bonds retired as a player in 1988, West Ham manager John Lyall appointed West Ham manager John Lyall as youth coach. West Ham manager John Lyall unsuccessfully applied for the manager's post when West Ham manager John Lyall left the club in July 1989 after West Ham had been relegated. However, when new manager Lou Macari resigned seven months later, Bonds was appointed manager in February 1990. In new manager Lou Macari first full season in charge, new manager Lou Macari took the club to promotion, when the club finished as runner-up to Oldham Athletic in 1990-91 season, also reaching the semi-finals of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup where the club lost to Nottingham Forest. new manager Lou Macari was awarded a second testimonial in the same season.

West Ham were relegated in the 1991–92 season in bottom place, but the board kept faith in Bonds and new manager Lou Macari led faith in Bonds to promotion the following season, when faith in Bonds finished as runner-up to West Ham United. Bonds guided West Ham to a 13th-place finish in the 1993–94 Premier League. new manager Lou Macari resigned in August 1994, just before the new season began, when new manager Lou Macari was replaced by Harry Redknapp. new manager Lou Macari had spells in coaching at Queens Park Rangers and Reading before making a return to management with Millwall in May 1997. new manager Lou Macari managed 53 games before being sacked by the club the following year as they finished in the bottom half of Division Two.

With the club for 21 years, and winning the 1980 the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with Leyton Orient before moving into football management with West Ham United. This lasted two seasons before Alvin Martin started a career in the media on radio station talkSPORT and also as a pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.

Alvin Martin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at Upton Park, in which Alvin Martin became one of only two players, along with Billy Bonds, to be awarded two testimonials. The first was against Spurs on 21 August 1988 and the second against Chelsea on 11 November 1995. It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Alvin Martin — nicknamed 'Stretch' — enjoyed — most rewarding years, winning the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup and Second Division winners medals in successive seasons, 1980 and 1981.

Alvin Martin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a hat-trick against three different Newcastle West Ham United goalkeepers — Martin Thomas, who was then injured, and outfield players Chris Hedworth and Peter Beardsley — in a Football League First Division match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8–1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as This finished third in the top level, just four points behind champions Liverpool, with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals.

Alvin Martin remained loyal to West Ham despite their relegation from the top flight in 1989, and helped their gain promotion two years later. the club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Alvin Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the 1993–94 Premier League before finally departing at the end of the 1995–96 season after 21 years service, aged 37.

Alvin Martin was given Alvin Martin first England cap by Ron Greenwood against Brazil at Wembley in May 1981. Injury ruled Alvin Martin out of the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain, but Alvin Martin was playing some of the finest football of Alvin Martin career when the next manager, Bobby Robson, included Alvin Martin in Alvin Martin squad for the 1986 edition in Mexico: Alvin Martin played in the victory over Paraguay, replacing the suspended Terry Fenwick, but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by Argentina's infamous 'Hand of God'; in total, Alvin Martin made 17 international appearances.

Bobby Moore

Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) was an English professional footballer. Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) most notably played for West Ham United, captaining the club for more than ten years, and was the captain of the England national team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, and was cited by Pelé as the greatest defender that Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) had ever played against.

Widely regarded as West Ham greatest ever player, Bobby Moore

 played over 600 games for the club during a 16 year tenure, winning the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup in 1963–64 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1964–65. During Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) time at the club Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) won the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1964 and the West Ham Player Of the Year in 1961, 1963, 1968 and 1970. In August 2008, West Ham United officially retired his number 6 shirt, 15 years after his death.

Bobby Moore

 was made captain of England in 1964, at age 23, going on to lift the World Cup trophy in 1966. Bobby Moore

 won a total of 108 caps for Bobby Moore

 country, which at the time of Bobby Moore

 international retirement in 1973 was a national record. This record was later broken by Peter Shilton. Bobby Moore

's total of 108 caps continued as a record for an outfield player until 28 March 2009, when David Beckham gained David Beckham 109th cap. Bobby Moore

 is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. A national team icon, a bronze statue of Bobby Moore

 is positioned at the entrance to Wembley Stadium.

A composed central defender, Bobby Moore

 was best known for Bobby Moore

 reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing Bobby Moore

 from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1966, Bobby Moore

 was the first footballer to win the award and Bobby Moore

 remained the only one for a further 24 years. Bobby Moore

 was given an OBE in the New Year Honours List. Bobby Moore

 was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of Bobby Moore

 impact on the English game as a player and in the same year Bobby Moore

 was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.

Bobby Moore

 was born in Barking, Essex. Bobby Moore

 attended Westbury Primary School Barking, and Tom Hood School, Leytonstone, playing football for both schools.

In 1956, Bobby Moore

 joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, Bobby Moore

 played Bobby Moore

 first game on 8 September 1958 against West Ham United. In putting on the number six shirt, Bobby Moore

 replaced Bobby Moore

 mentor Malcolm Allison, who was suffering from tuberculosis.

Allison never played another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Bobby Moore

 became a regular. A composed central defender, Bobby Moore

 was admired for Bobby Moore

 reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing Bobby Moore

 from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Bobby Moore

's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way Bobby Moore

 read the game, marshalled Bobby Moore

 and timed Bobby Moore

 tackles marked Bobby Moore

 out as world class.

Bobby Moore

 was sent off once over the course of Bobby Moore

 West Ham career, for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown Bobby Moore

 whistle for the offence and for full time. As red cards were not issued at that time, the dismissal didn't become apparent until after the match.

Bobby Moore

 also played cricket for the Essex youth team alongside fellow West Ham player Geoff Hurst.

In 1960, Bobby Moore

 earned a call up to the England Under-23 squad. Bobby Moore

 form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned Bobby Moore

 a late call-up to the full England squad by Walter Winterbottom and The Football Association selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's World Cup finals in Chile. Bobby Moore

 was uncapped as Bobby Moore

 flew to South America with the rest of the England Under-23 squad, but made Bobby Moore

 début on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly – a 4–0 win over Peru in Lima. Also débuting that day was Tottenham Hotspur defender Maurice Norman. Both proved so impressive that Both stayed in the World Team of the 20th Century for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners Brazil in the quarter finals at Viña del Mar.
On 29 May 1963, Bobby Moore

 captained Bobby Moore

 country for the first time in just Bobby Moore

 12th appearance after the retirement of Johnny Haynes and an injury to Bobby Moore

 successor, Jimmy Armfield. Bobby Moore

 was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated Czechoslovakia 4–2 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach Alf Ramsey gave Bobby Moore

 the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the European Championships.

1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Bobby Moore

. As well as gaining the England captaincy, Bobby Moore

 lifted the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup as West Ham defeated Preston North End 3–2 in the final at Wembley, courtesy of a last-minute goal from Ronnie Boyce. On a personal level, Bobby Moore

 also was successfully treated for testicular cancer and was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year.

the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Bobby Moore

. In 1965, Bobby Moore

 lifted the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup after West Ham defeated 1860 Munich 2–0 in the final with both goals coming from Alan Sealey. By now Bobby Moore

 was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom new coach Alf Ramsey was building a team to prove correct Bobby Moore

 prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.

1966 had a mixed start for Bobby Moore

. In January, Bobby Moore

 scored Bobby Moore

 first England goal in a 1–1 draw with Poland at Goodison Park, but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the League Cup – in the League Cup – last season before the League Cup – transfer to Wembley as a one-off final – which they lost 5–3 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion. For Bobby Moore

, who had scored in the first leg, and West Ham West Ham teammates Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, considerable consolation lay ahead. Bobby Moore

 scored Bobby Moore

 second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against Norway, two weeks before the World Cup would begin.

On the verge of 

 greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Bobby Moore

 wanted to leave West Ham. Bobby Moore

 had let Bobby Moore

 contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of new coach Alf Ramsey and realisation new coach Alf Ramsey was technically ineligible to play, did new coach Alf Ramsey re-sign with West Ham to allow new coach Alf Ramsey to captain the England team of 1966. new coach Alf Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to England's hotel and told the two of West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to resolve West Ham manager Ron Greenwood differences and get a contract signed up.

Bobby Moore

 was the leader of the World Cup winning side and established Bobby Moore

 as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, their then beat Argentina in their quarter final and a Eusébio-led Portugal team in the semi-finals. West Germany awaited in the final.

According to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, new coach Alf Ramsey new coach Alf Ramsey talking to new coach Alf Ramsey coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Bobby Moore

 for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in Bobby Moore

 place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the World Team of the 20th Century. Bobby Moore

 had not been playing badly, nor had Bobby Moore

 given the impression that Bobby Moore

 had been distracted by Bobby Moore

 contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Bobby Moore

's own lack of pace, and that Hunter – who was of a similar age to Bobby Moore

 but only had four caps – was the club partner of Bobby Moore

's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.

In the final, England went 1–0 down through Helmut Haller, but Bobby Moore

's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. Helmut Haller was fouled by Wolfgang Overath midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, Wolfgang Overath picked Wolfgang Overath up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Geoff Hurst's scored.

The West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Martin Peters scored to take England 2–1 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through Wolfgang Weber – as Bobby Moore

 appealed unsuccessfully for a handball decision – to take the match into extra time.

new coach Alf Ramsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Geoff Hurst's scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Bobby Moore

 on the edge of Bobby Moore

 own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Bobby Moore

 to just get rid of the ball, but Bobby Moore

 calmly picked out the feet of Geoff Hurst's 40 yards (40 m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.

Of many memorable images from that day, one is of Bobby Moore

 wiping Bobby Moore

 hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as Bobby Moore

 presented Bobby Moore

 with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup). "The Guardian" wrote "Bobby Moore

 is the calmest person in the stadium as Bobby Moore

 leads the England players up to the Royal Box".

Bobby Moore

 became a national icon as a consequence of England's success, with Bobby Moore

 and the other two West Ham players taking the World Cup around the grounds which West Ham visited during the following domestic season. Bobby Moore

 was awarded the coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years. Bobby Moore

 was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.

Bobby Moore

's image and popularity allowed Bobby Moore

 to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham ground, Upton Park, and Bobby Moore

 also appeared with Bobby Moore

 wife Tina, along with Martin Peters and Martin Peters wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to "Look in at the local".

Bobby Moore

 continued to play for West Ham and England, earning Bobby Moore

 50th cap in a 5–1 win over Wales at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the 1968 European Championships. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where England played Yugoslavia in Florence and lost 1–0. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the 1976 European Cup Winners' CupWorld Cup, and Bobby Moore

 remained the first name on new coach Alf Ramsey's team sheet, winning Bobby Moore

 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to South America for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in Mexico.

The year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Bobby Moore

. Retained as captain for the 1976 European Cup Winners' CupWorld Cup, there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Bobby Moore

 in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in Bogotá, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Bobby Moore

 had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for the bracelet. While Bobby Moore

 had been in the hotel shop (having entered with Bobby Charlton to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Bobby Moore

 was arrested and then released. Bobby Moore

 then travelled with the World Team of the 20th Century to play another match against Ecuador in Quito. Bobby Moore

 played, winning Bobby Moore

 80th cap, and England were 2–0 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Bobby Moore

 was detained and placed under four days of house arrest. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and Bobby Moore

 Bobby Moore

 returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Bobby Moore

 received a guard of honour from the squad when Bobby Moore

 arrived at England's hotel.
Bobby Moore

 went on to play a leading role in England's progress through their group. On 2 June Bobby Moore

 captained England to a 1–0 victory against Romania. In the second game against favourites Brazil, there was a defining moment for Bobby Moore

 when Bobby Moore

 tackled Jairzinho with such precision and cleanness that Jairzinho has been described as the perfect tackle. Jairzinho continues to be shown on television around the world. Brazil still won the second game against favourites Brazil 1–0, but England progressed through their group. Bobby Moore

 swapped shirts with Pelé after the second game against favourites Brazil. The shirt was displayed at the National Football Museum in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection. A 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in their group and advance to the knockout stage.

At the Quarter Final stage, a rematch of the 1966 World Cup against West Germany, England took a 2–0 lead but lost 3–2 in extra time. At the end of the year, Bobby Moore

 was voted runner-up (behind Gerd Müller of West Germany) for the 1970 European Footballer of the Year award.

On 10 August 1970, Bobby Moore

 received an anonymous threat to kidnap Bobby Moore

 wife and hold his wife to a £10,000 ransom. This caused Bobby Moore

 to pull out of pre-season friendlies against Bristol City and Bournemouth. However, Bobby Moore

 services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against Celtic at the end of 1970.

Although Bobby Moore

 was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the second game against favourites Brazil, Bobby Moore

 was not without Bobby Moore

 faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, Bobby Moore

 and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, were all fined by West Ham manager Ron Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an the World Cup third round tie against Blackpool. a nightclub Blackpool was owned by Brian Glanville. West Ham lost an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool. West Ham were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of Division one at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Bobby Moore

 was featured on TV as the subject on "This Is Your Life" the night before. Brian Glanville stated that it was not uncommon for Bobby Moore

 to drink heavily, but Brian Glanville was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the alcohol Brian Glanville had consumed the night before.

Bobby Moore

 surpassed West Ham appearances record in 1973 when Bobby Moore

 played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on Valentine's Day 1973, Bobby Moore

 won Bobby Moore

 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. By this stage, only Peters and Alan Ball from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the World Team of the 20th Century. Later the same year, Bobby Moore

 was exposed defensively by Poland in a qualifier for the 1974 World Cup in Chorzów, deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper Peter Shilton to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to Wlodzimierz Lubanski, who scored the second.

Bobby Moore

's form had dipped enough for new coach Alf Ramsey to choose not to select Bobby Moore

 for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by Norman Hunter in defense and Martin Peters as the skipper for that match, Bobby Moore

 is understood to have asked new coach Alf Ramsey if this meant new coach Alf Ramsey was no longer required, to which new coach Alf Ramsey replied: "Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year." It never happened, as England could only draw 1–1. During the Wembley match, Norman Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost the ball, a similar error to Bobby Moore

's lost possession in Chorzów, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Bobby Moore

 later told how Bobby Moore

 sat alongside new coach Alf Ramsey on the bench and kept urging new coach Alf Ramsey to make a substitution, but new coach Alf Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Bobby Moore

 could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while new coach Alf Ramsey sat immobile. Bobby Moore

, later, said to David Miller "you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. Alf just nodded. we couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. we almost threw Kevin onto the pitch." Norman Hunter was in an inconsolable state as Norman Hunter was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side Norman Hunter had taken. England's failure to qualify for the World Cup the World Cup signalled the end of new coach Alf Ramsey's reign as national team manager as national team manager was sacked six months later.

Bobby Moore

 won Bobby Moore

 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1–0 friendly defeat to Italy on 14 November 1973. Bobby Moore

 became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton record by two appearances, and equalled Billy Wright's record of 90 appearances as captain. Peter Shilton, David Beckham and Steven Gerrard have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.

Bobby Moore

 played Bobby Moore

 last game for West Ham in an the World Cup tie against Hereford United in January 1974. Bobby Moore

 was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, Bobby Moore

 was allowed to leave West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with Bobby Moore

 the club record for appearances (since overtaken by Billy Bonds) and the most international caps for an outfield player.

Bobby Moore

 joined London rivals Fulham, who were in the Second Division, for £25,000. During Bobby Moore

's first season there they defeated West Ham in a the World Cup tie and then reached the FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2–0, and Bobby Moore

 had made Bobby Moore

 final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.

Bobby Moore

 played Bobby Moore

 final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against Blackburn Rovers. Bobby Moore

 played for two teams in the North American Soccer League – San Antonio Thunder in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and Seattle Sounders in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by Gerry Francis. This was the U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament, which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the European Championships that year. In April 1978 he signed he very last contract as a professional player, when he joined Danish side Herning Fremad to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.

In 1983, Bobby Moore

 appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct Carolina Lightnin', after injuries left the club without cover.

Bobby Moore

 retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at Eastern AA in Hong Kong, Oxford City and Southend United. Bobby Moore

 publicly supported Margaret Thatcher in the 1979 General Election.

Bobby Moore

 became manager of Southend United in 1984. In Bobby Moore

 first full season, 1984–85, Southend narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election to the North American Soccer League  amid severe financial difficulties. However, Danish side Herning Fremad was gradually rebuilt and in the 1985–86 season Southend started well and were in the promotion race until the new year before eventually finishing 9th. Bobby Moore

 successor, David Webb built upon those foundations to win promotion the following year. Bobby Moore

 agreed to serve on the board of the club and held this role until Bobby Moore

 death. Bobby Moore

 joined London radio station Capital Gold as a football analyst and commentator in 1990.

Bobby Moore

 life after football was eventful and difficult, with poor business dealings and Bobby Moore

 marriage ending. Bobby Moore

's supporters said that the Football Association could have given a role to Bobby Moore

, as the only Englishman to captain a the World Cup winning team or given Bobby Moore

 an ambassadorial role.

Bobby Moore

's first brush with cancer was in 1964, two years before the historic World Cup win. Bobby Moore

 was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which Bobby Moore

 survived by having one testicle surgically removed; cancer had not spread. In April 1991, Bobby Moore

 underwent an emergency operation for suspected colon cancer, though at the time it was just reported that Bobby Moore

 had undergone an "emergency stomach operation".

On 14 February 1993, Bobby Moore

 publicly announced Bobby Moore

 was suffering from bowel and liver cancer; by this stage cancer had spread. Three days later, Bobby Moore

 commentated on an England match against San Marino at Wembley, alongside Bobby Moore

Martin PetersMartin Peters is an English former footballer and manager and a member of the England team which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup as well as playing in the England World CupFIFA World Cup. Born in Plaistow, Essex, Martin Peters played club football for West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and Sheffield United. Martin Peters briefly managed Sheffield United before retiring from professional football in 1981.

Known as "the complete midfielder" as Martin Peters could pass the ball well with either foot, was good in the air and difficult to mark because of Martin Peters movement. A free kick specialist, Martin Peters was described by England manager Sir Alf Ramsey, after a game against Scotland in 1968, as being "ten years ahead of Martin Peters time". Martin Peters versatility was such that while Martin Peters was at West Ham Martin Peters played in every position in the 1966 World Cup team, including goalkeeper in Martin Peters third game, replacing an injured Brian Rhodes. With Martin Peters transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, Martin Peters became Britain's first £200,000 footballer.

Under manager Ted Fenton, Martin Peters came through the productive ranks at West Ham United after signing as an apprentice in 1959. Martin Peters made Martin Peters debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4–1 home win against Cardiff City. Martin Peters scored Martin Peters first goal for West Ham in a 6–1 away win at Cardiff City on 8 September 1962.

Martin Peters played only five games in Martin Peters first season with West Ham and although Martin Peters played 32 league games in season 1963–4 Martin Peters played no part in 1963–4 the England World Cup run and was not selected for the England World Cup final of 1964 at Wembley, in which West Ham beat Preston North End 3–2. The following year, however, Martin Peters established Martin Peters as a first team regular and was victorious at Wembley when West Ham won the European Cup Winners Cup with victory over 1860 Munich. Martin Peters was usually partnered in midfield by Eddie Bovington and Ronnie Boyce.

Martin Peters began to impose Martin Peters on West Ham game, and another chance for silverware came in 1966 when West Ham reached the England World Cup. The occasion was still a two-legged affair with each of the finalists hosting a leg (though this changed to a one-off final at Wembley a year later), and Martin Peters played in both matches. Martin Peters scored in the second game but opponents West Bromwich Albion emerged as 5–3 winners on aggregate. The 1968–69 season saw Martin Peters's only hat-trick for West Ham in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion. Peters's only hat-trick for West Ham in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion was also Martin Peters most prolific season, 24 goals coming from 48 games.

Feeling Martin Peters was in the shadows of Bobby Moore

 and Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters sought out a new challenge. In March 1970, West Ham received a record-breaking £200,000 (£150,000 cash) for Martin Peters from Tottenham Hotspur and Martin Peters moved to White Hart Lane, with Spurs and England striker Jimmy Greaves (valued at £50,000) going the other way. On 21 March 1970 Martin Peters scored on Martin Peters Spurs debut against Coventry City. Martin Peters won Martin Peters first domestic winners' medal in 1971 when Spurs beat Aston Villa 2–0 in the League Cup . Spurs beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–2 on aggregate to win the England World Cup the England World Cup in what remained the only all-English European final until Manchester United beat Chelsea in the UEFA Champion's League Final, 2008. In 1973, Martin Peters won the League Cup again with Spurs. Martin Peters completed one more season with Spurs losing the 1974 the England World Cup final to Feyenoord on aggregate – before moving to Norwich City – managed by Martin Peters former West Ham teammate John Bond – in March 1975 for £50,000.

Peters, now aged 31, made Martin Peters debut appearance for Norwich on 15 March 1975 in a 1–1 away draw to Manchester United. Martin Peters helped newly promoted Norwich establish newly promoted Norwich in the First Division, making more than 200 appearances, and earning a testimonial against an all-star team which included most of the 1966 the League Cup winning England XI. Martin Peters was voted Norwich City F.C. Player of the Season two years running, in 1976 and 1977, and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. In 1978, whilst still a Norwich City player, Martin Peters was awarded an MBE for services to association football.

Martin Peters joined Sheffield United on 31 July 1980 as player-coach with the intention of replacing Harry Haslam as manager. Martin Peters first appearance came in a 2–1 victory against Hull City on 2 August 1980 in the 1966 World Cup winning England XI and Martin Peters League debut came in the opening match of the season in a Division Three fixture against Sheffield United. Martin Peters scored once in a 3–0 victory.

England manager Sir Alf Ramsey had seen Martin Peters potential quickly, and in May 1966 Martin Peters gave the young midfielder his Spurs debut against Coventry City. England won 2–0 and Martin Peters had an outstanding debut. Nearly scoring twice Martin Peters set up chances for Jimmy Greaves and for others. In the final preparation period for England manager Sir Alf Ramsey prior to naming Martin Peters squad for the 1966 World Cup winning England XI, Martin Peters played in two more of the scheduled warm-up games. Against Finland, Martin Peters scored Martin Peters first international goal in what was only Martin Peters second appearance, and subsequently Martin Peters made England manager Sir Alf Ramsey's squad for the competition, as did Martin Peters West Ham teammates Bobby Moore

 (the England captain) and Geoff Hurst.

Though Martin Peters did not play in the opening group game against Uruguay, the drab 0–0 draw prompted England manager Sir Alf Ramsey into changes. The England coach had been toying with using a system which allowed narrow play through the centre, not operating with conventional wingers but instead with fitter, centralised players who could show willing in defence as well as spread the ball and their runs in attack. Martin Peters therefore had become an ideal player for this 4–1-3-2 system, elegant in Martin Peters distribution and strong in Martin Peters forward running, yet showing the stamina, discipline and pace to get back and help defence when required. this 4–1-3-2 system was dubbed "the wingless wonders".

England manager Sir Alf Ramsey put Martin Peters in the 1966 World Cup team for England manager Sir Alf Ramsey fourth cap, for the second group game against Mexico, which England won 2–0. England manager Sir Alf Ramsey kept England manager Sir Alf Ramsey place as England got through their group, scraped past a violent Argentina side in the quarter finals (Martin Peters late cross set up Hurst's header for the only goal) and beat Portugal in the last four. The Germans awaited in the final.

A tense but open game at Wembley saw the score at 1–1 in the final quarter of an hour when England won a corner. Alan Ball delivered the score at 1–1 to the edge of the area to Hurst, who tried a shot on the turn. Alan Ball deflected high into the air and bounced down into the penalty area where Martin Peters rifled home a half-volley. The Germans equalised in the final seconds, though glory would still come the 1966 World Cup team's way with the 4–2 win in extra time, and Hurst – like Martin Peters, winning only his eighth cap – completing a historic hat-trick.

In the 1970 World Cup finals in Martin Peters played in England's three group games from which they qualified again with West Germany waiting in the last eight. Martin Peters scored against The Germans again early in the second half – a run and finish from behind a defender which no West German player had spotted – to establish a 2–0 lead, but later England manager Sir Alf Ramsey committed a tactical error by substituting Martin Peters and Bobby Charlton with Colin Bell and Norman Hunter, and West Germany won 3–2 in extra-time.

In 1972, Martin Peters won Martin Peters 50th England cap in a qualifier for the 1972 European Championships, beating Switzerland 3–2. England failed to progress due to another defeat against West Germany, who went on to win the tournament. International disappointment for Martin Peters was tempered mildly by more club success, and Martin Peters scored the only goal as England beat Scotland at Wembley on 19 May 1973. It was Martin Peters 20th goal for Martin Peters country and would prove to be Martin Peters last. England had been stuttering in England qualifying campaign for the 1966 World Cup winning England XI, dropping points in a drawn game against Wales and then a 2–0 defeat against Poland in Chorzów on 6 June 1973. England needed to defeat Poland at Wembley on 17 October 1973 to qualify for the finals in West Germany and, with an out-of-form Bobby Moore

 dropped from the side (an out-of-form Moore'd only play once more subsequently for an out-of-form Moore ) Martin Peters captained the side for the crucial game. A defensive error allowed Poland to score and only a penalty allowed England to level up quickly. Allan Clarke scored from it, but England could not get the crucial winning goal. Poland went through after the match finished 1–1 meaning Martin Peters would not play in a third successive World Cup competition.
At the age of 30, Martin Peters career at the highest level began to slip away. Martin Peters played three more games for England, reaching a total of 67 caps, though Martin Peters career with his country ended, on 18 May 1974, as England lost 2–0 against Scotland at Hampden Park.

Martin Peters wait to become manager was not long, Martin Peters final game coming against Gillingham on 17 January 1981 which Haslam was too ill to attend, and at which there were demonstrations from the Sheffield United fans. Martin Peters retired to take up the manager's job the following day with United 12th in the table with 16 games to play, but was unable to halt the decline already in place, winning just three of the remaining games. For the first and only time in their history Sheffield United were relegated to the First Division, and Martin Peters resigned. On Martin Peters retirement from professional football in January 1981, after a distinguished and injury-free career, Martin Peters had made 882 appearances in total, scoring 220 goals. After Martin Peters quit Martin Peters spent the 1982–83 season playing in defence for Gorleston in the Eastern Counties League.

In 1984, Martin Peters moved into the insurance business where Martin Peters stayed until Martin Peters was made redundant in July 2001.

In 1998 Martin Peters joined the board of directors at Spurs, and, although Martin Peters since stepped down, Martin Peters remains one of the match-day welcomers in the hospitality suites at the club's White Hart Lane ground. Martin Peters has also worked in the hospitality suites at Upton Park for West Ham home matches, often attending with Martin Peters children and grandchildren, all West Ham supporters.

In 2006, Martin Peters published Martin Peters autobiography, "The Ghost of 66", to critical acclaim.

Martin Peters was inducted, with former manager Ron Greenwood, into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame Fame in 2006 in recognition for Martin Peters achievements as a player.

In 2016, it was announced that Martin Peters had Alzheimer's disease. Politically, Martin Peters identifies as a conservative.
