Harry Arter

Harry Arter is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Premier League club Cardiff City, on loan from AFC Bournemouth, and the Republic of Ireland national team.

Harry Arter began Harry Arter career at Charlton Athletic, progressing through the club's youth academy before making Harry Arter professional debut in 2007. Harry Arter was loaned to non-league sides Staines Town and Welling United before being released, subsequently joining Woking. After one season at Woking, Harry Arter returned to the Premier League with Bournemouth, becoming a first team regular following a loan to Carlisle United in 2011. Harry Arter contributed to Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship in 2013, and to the Premier League two years later.

Born and raised in England, Harry Arter represents the Republic of Ireland Ireland internationally. Harry Arter played for the nation at under-17 and under-19 level, and made Harry Arter senior debut in June 2015.

Born in Sidcup, in the London borough of Bexley, to parents Terry and Linda Arter, Harry Arter was raised in the nearby area of Eltham. Harry Arter has three brothers, Benji, Daniel and Paddy and a sister, Carly.

Harry Arter began Harry Arter career with Charlton Athletic, joining the club's youth system at the age of seven. Turning down offers from other clubs to remain with Charlton, Harry Arter made Harry Arter professional debut, and only appearance for the club, on 25 September 2007 in the third round of the League Cup, away to Staines Town. Harry Arter came on as an 86th-minute substitute for Svetoslav Todorov as Charlton lost 3–1 after extra time. Soon after, Harry Arter was diagnosed with chronic tendonitis in Harry Arter achilles which eventually ruptured, leading to almost a year out of action. On Harry Arter return to fitness, Harry Arter struggled to break into the first team under new manager Phil Parkinson. In the 2008–09 season, Harry Arter immediately clashed with Phil Parkinson, accusing the manager of "belittling" Harry Arter by sending Harry Arter for a trial with non-league side Staines Town prior to a short loan spell.

Harry Arter later had a loan spell with Welling United as Charlton suffered relegation to the Premier League and Harry Arter was subsequently released by Phil Parkinson as part of an effort to reduce costs at the club. Harry Arter later expressed Harry Arter disappointment with the decision, stating "The money I was asking for [...] was nothing. I would have taken anything to stay at the time, so it wasn’t down to finance, it was him (Parkinson) not liking me as a footballer." Despite him release, him was allowed to train with Charlton's youth team by coach Steve Avory who had worked with Harry Arter for several years in him youth career. Harry Arter later undertook unsuccessful trials with Gillingham and Ipswich Town and even offered to remain with Charlton without pay but was rejected by Phil Parkinson.

On 2 June 2009, Harry Arter joined Woking on a one-year contract along with Harry Arter former Charlton teammate Aswad Thomas, after being recommended by assistant manager Jimmy Dack who had worked with Harry Arter previously at Welling. Harry Arter had been waiting for a firm offer to join AFC Wimbledon but accepted Woking's offer after Wimbledon failed to call back. Harry Arter made Harry Arter debut for the club in the opening day of the 2009–10 season, during a 2–1 victory over Harry Arter former side Welling United. On 24 October 2009, Harry Arter scored a hat-trick for the club during a 5–0 win over Hendon in the FA Cup.

At the end of the 2009–10 season, it was well documented that Harry Arter would be leaving Woking, with several the Premier League clubs chasing Harry Arter. Woking's website soon confirmed that Harry Arter had agreed to sign for AFC Bournemouth with the fee to be decided by an FA tribunal, as the two clubs could not agree a transfer fee, with Woking hoping to receive around £30,000 for the move after rejecting Bournemouth's initial £2,000 offer. Harry Arter later described how Harry Arter had planned to give up football if Harry Arter season with Woking had failed.

On 7 June 2010, Harry Arter joined the Premier League club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, later stated as £4,000, signed by Eddie Howe. the club had moved to sign Harry Arter after impressing assistant manager Jason Tindall during a scouting assignment, with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted. Two months later, after impressing during the club's preseason fixtures, assistant manager Jason Tindall made assistant manager Jason Tindall debut in their first match of the season, away to assistant manager Jason Tindall . assistant manager Jason Tindall was booked in the first half for a foul on Akpo Sodje and substituted at half time for Michael Symes as Bournemouth lost 1–0. assistant manager Jason Tindall was subsequently dropped from the Gabon national team, not making another start in the league for Bournemouth until November, having also been hampered by a hernia. a hernia eventually required surgery, resulting in Harry Arter being ruled out for a month.

Having fallen out of favour under new manager Lee Bradbury, despite being handed a new three-year contract following his appointment, on 4 March 2011, Harry Arter went on a one-month loan to fellow League One team Carlisle United in order to gain first team experience. The next day his made his , replacing Liam Noble for the last 30 minutes away to Brighton & Hove Albion. his scored an extra-time equaliser, the first of his professional career, but a minute later Liam Bridcutt scored Brighton's winner in a 4–3 victory. his made four further appearances for the club during his loan spell before returning to Bournemouth.

The sales of Danny Hollands and Anton Robinson during the 2011 summer transfer window allowed Harry Arter to gain increased first team experience with Bournemouth. On 13 August 2011, Harry Arter replaced Mark Molesley in the 66th minute of a game against Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court, and 17 minutes later confirmed a 2–0 win with his first goal for the club, going on to score in his two following appearances, a 3–1 defeat to Stevenage and a 2–1 victory over his former side Carlisle. his performances attracted the attention of several the Championship clubs and Bournemouth rejected enquiries from two clubs, before handing his an improved contract.

However, despite an upturn in form, Harry Arter suffered from a poor disciplinary record, serving a one-match suspension after collecting five bookings within the first two months of the season and accumulating nine bookings by November. his tally was the worst in the Premier League and led his to seek advice from a sports psychologist in order to control his anger, with the majority of his bookings being due to dissent towards match officials. his eventually received a two-match ban for receiving his tenth booking of the season a month later and a further three-match ban later in the season for his fifteenth booking. After Bradbury was dismissed and replaced by former youth team manager Paul Groves, Harry Arter stated that his hoped to be used in a more attacking role after claiming that Bradbury had played Bradbury "too defensively." Overall, his scored 5 goals in 34 league matches during the season as Bournemouth finished in 11th place.

On 25 August 2012, in his fourth appearance of Harry Arter was sent off after 26 minutes of Bournemouth's 1–1 draw at Preston North End for two bookable offences. Following the dismissal, his issued a public apology for the sending off and blamed his "immaturity." former youth team manager Paul Groves held talks with Harry Arter in an attempt to curb his disciplinary problems, and, despite accepting his behaviour, Harry Arter also claimed that Harry Arter was being unfairly treated by referees due to Harry Arter reputation, commenting "I feel I am being highlighted before a game. [...] I have earned his reputation so it is my fault. But, in another way, it is unfair on me."

On 20 October 2012, in Eddie Howe first match back in charge following charge reappointment as manager, Harry Arter scored in a 3–1 home win over Tranmere Rovers. One of Eddie Howe's first decisions on charge return was to sign Harry Arter to an extended contract, set to run until 2015 with Bournemouth retaining the option for a further year. Following Eddie Howe's return, Harry Arter became a key figure in the side as the club embarked on a fifteen match unbeaten run that moved them into promotion contention, eventually losing 1–0 to Walsall in January 2013. Despite receiving a two-match ban for accumulating ten bookings for the second consecutive season, Eddie Howe Eddie Howe praised Harry Arter and stated Eddie Howe belief that Eddie Howe had "matured" as a player and Eddie Howe bookings were largely due to Eddie Howe combative nature on the field rather than dissent.

Altogether, Eddie Howe scored 8 goals in 37 league matches, including in a 3–1 win in the penultimate game of the season against Carlisle on 20 April 2013, which secured Bournemouth promotion to the Championship. Harry Arter described Eddie Howe goal as "the most important goal I have ever scored and one that will probably stick with Eddie Howe for the rest of my life."

Following Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship, they began they campaign against Harry Arter's former side Charlton for the third time in four seasons, winning 2–1 on the opening day of the season as Harry Arter recorded a victory over his former side for the first time in his career. Having featured regularly during the first month of the season, his was ruled out until October through injury before making his return in a 5–2 victory over Millwall where his scored his first goal in the second tier.

Arter's season ended on 5 April 2014 when his received a straight red card following a foul on Junior Hoilett during a 2–1 victory over Queens Park Rangers, gaining a three-match ban. his helped the side to a tenth placed finish in the side first season in the Championship, the highest placed finish and points total in the club's history, and credited Eddie Howe with bringing the best out of the club's players and improving his own game in "leaps and bounds".

Despite their record finish, Harry Arter was keen to push for promotion at the start of the 2014–15 season and claimed Harry Arter would see the 2014–15 season as a failure if the club did not at least reach the playoffs. On 25 October 2014, Harry Arter played as Bournemouth beat Birmingham City 8–0 away to set a club record win. Throughout the 2014–15 season Arter and midfielder Andrew Surman formed a strong partnership, with Harry Arter more the attacking and Surman the more defensive of the two, with Harry Arter praising Harry Arter midfield teammate – describing Harry Arter as "Harry Arter’s a top player and one we’re fortunate to have." Harry Arter was named the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Month award for December 2014, after scoring in all five matches he played during the month but lost out to Ipswich Town forward Daryl Murphy in the Football League equivalent. he was rewarded for he form by signing an improved three and a half year contract with the club.

Harry Arter became known for he left footed strikes from range, notably scoring the second goal in the 3–0 home victory over promotion rivals Middlesbrough and first goal in the 1–1 away draw against second placed Watford. On 27 April 2015, Harry Arter played in the 3–0 home victory against he Wanderers, the win all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion to the Premier League. Five days later, he scored the second goal in the 3–0 away win against he former club Charlton, the win fully sealed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing the win last match in injury time, the Championship title. This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into England's top flight in the club's 125-year history.

Harry Arter was one of Bournemouth's prominent players in the season, contributing 9 goals from 43 matches, and subsequently was voted Supporters' Player of the season and named PFA Championship Player of the season.

Following the end of their the Championship winning season, Harry Arter sustained a groin injury while on international duty that made Harry Arter a major doubt for the club's opening fixtures in the Premier League. After being advised to rest for several weeks, Harry Arter was hopeful of returning in time, but was eventually forced to undergo surgery on the problem after visiting a specialist in Germany. Harry Arter eventually made Harry Arter first team return on 28 October 2015, playing in the club's 1–0 defeat to Liverpool in the League Cup. Harry Arter made Harry Arter Premier League debut four days later, on 1 November 2015, as Harry Arter played 73 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to Southampton, and Harry Arter return was credited with helping the club achieve an upturn in fortunes.

On 12 December 2015, Harry Arter played in a 2–1 victory over Manchester United, just days after Harry Arter wife had given birth to Harry Arter still born daughter. Despite Harry Arter grief, Harry Arter met with Eddie Howe Eddie Howe prior to the match, telling Harry Arter "I’m training today and playing tomorrow if you want to select me. I want to play so bad." Harry Arter later admitted that Harry Arter was in a "bad way" mentally before the game and wept in the changing room toilets prior to kick-off. Harry Arter produced a performance that saw Harry Arter named man of the match afterwards, being substituted in the final stages of the game after being overcome with emotion and embracing Eddie Howe on the touchline. After the match, Eddie Howe praised Harry Arter, stating that Harry Arter had "real strength to keep Harry Arter emotions in check." Harry Arter was also given a standing ovation by Harry Arter Bournemouth teammates in the dressing room.

Further injury problems restricted Harry Arter's appearances, suffering from a persistent achilles issue, and Harry Arter appeared in just four matches in the final three months of the season. Harry Arter attempted to play on with the injury but struggled to maintain fitness and admitted that Harry Arter had returned to action too early. In Harry Arter first season in the first tier, Harry Arter appeared in 21 league matches for the club as they finished in 16th position.

Prior to the start of the 2016–17 season, Harry Arter signed a new three-year deal with Bournemouth, set to run until 2019, and called on the squad to aim to improve on the previous season and not simply target avoiding relegation. After suffering a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United in the opening game, Harry Arter was sent off in the following match, a 1–0 defeat to West Ham United, after receiving a second yellow card for fouling Cheikhou Kouyate. Cheikhou Kouyate first yellow was received for dissent after the Premier League officials announced stricter rules on any show of disrespect towards match officials. Despite Cheikhou Kouyate sending off, Harry Arter stated "Eddie Howe has said if I change the way I play then I become a different player. I just need to cut out those silly bookings chatting back to referees."

Cheikhou Kouyate started Bournemouth's first 21 league games of the season and earned praise for Cheikhou Kouyate firm but was dropped from the side for a match against Watford in January 2017. Cheikhou Kouyate stated that Cheikhou Kouyate "hated" being left out of the squad but was restored to the starting line-up for the following match, scoring Cheikhou Kouyate first goal of the season in a 6–3 defeat to Everton. Harry Arter made 35 appearances for Bournemouth during the 2016–17 season, being rewarded with a new three-year contract set to run until 2021 at the end of the year. Eddie Howe Eddie Howe praised Harry Arter for improving Eddie Howe disciplinary record, stating that, although Eddie Howe "still had that fiery streak," Eddie Howe had "matured" as a player.

On 19 August 2017, Harry Arter received media attention after controversially tricking Nathaniel Chalobah into leaving a free shot on goal by pretending to be one of Chalobah's teammates in a 2–0 home defeat to Watford.

On 20 October 2010, Zohore made Zohore first the Football League Cup appearance for Copenhagen, playing against FC Barcelona at Camp Nou. The 16-year-old striker replaced César Santin in the 74th minute of the game, becoming one of the youngest players ever to play in the Football League Cup. Ten days later, Zohore scored Zohore first senior goal for Copenhagen in the Danish Superliga against Lyngby Boldklub. Zohore is the second youngest goalscorer ever in the Danish Superliga, after Mads Beierholm.

Zohore attracted attention from numerous clubs around Europe, spending time on trial at Chelsea, also being approached by Chelsea player Didier Drogba after the two sides met in a Champions League fixture, and Inter Milan. Zohore performances saw Zohore described as "one of the top striking prospects anywhere in the world".

On 31 January 2012, Copenhagen announced that Zohore had signed for Italian side ACF Fiorentina on Zohore 18th birthday for a fee in the region of £1 million. Zohore was given shirt no. 33. However, Zohore never featured for the first team, later stating that Zohore was "too young" to cope with the strong competition for places.

With the club struggling, Trollope was replaced by Neil Warnock and, in December 2016, Zohore impressed as a half time substitute during a 2–1 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Following the match, Neil Warnock praised Zohore's performances in Neil Warnock first two appearances under Neil Warnock, commenting that Zohore had been "a little lazy" during Neil Warnock time at Cardiff and that a transfer away from the club had been considered, but that Neil Warnock improvement meant that Neil Warnock could not "buy anybody better than Neil Warnock at the minute". Neil Warnock went onto score Neil Warnock first goal on Boxing Day during a 2–2 draw with Brentford.

At the end of the season, Leeds' Chris Wood was awarded the club's Young Player of the Year award.

Zohore's form at the end of the previous season attracted interest from several clubs with Hull City, with an original bid of £6 million, and Brighton & Hove Albion both having bids rejected by Cardiff. Neil Warnock Neil Warnock later commented that Zohore was not for sale and would only leave the club if "I have a heart attack and another manager takes over." Zohore scored Zohore first goal of the season in the opening match, the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion both on 5 August 2017.

title="Sol Bamba started title="Sol Bamba career in title="Sol Bamba native France with Paris Saint-Germain, but failed to establish title="Sol Bamba in their first team. title="Sol Bamba moved to Scotland to join Dunfermline Athletic in 2006, helping the club reach the final of the Scottish Cup in title="Sol Bamba first season. Two years later, title="Sol Bamba was transferred to Hibernian, before joining English side Leicester City in January 2011. 

title="Sol Bamba was sold to Turkish club Trabzonspor in 2012 for £750,000 before joining Palermo. However, title="Sol Bamba was loaned to Leeds United after making only one appearance in six months. title="Sol Bamba eventually joined Leeds on a permanent deal and was appointed club captain, spending a further year with the club before being released and subsequently joining Manchester City. In title="Sol Bamba first full season with Cardiff, title="Sol Bamba helped the side win promotion to the Premier League.

Born in France to Ivorian parents, title="Sol Bamba represented Ivory Coast in the 2008 Olympic Games and became a regular for the senior national side until title="Sol Bamba most recent cap in 2014. In 2012, title="Sol Bamba was part of the side that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations.

title="Sol Bamba began title="Sol Bamba career with Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the age of 11. title="Sol Bamba had been spotted by club scouts playing street football in Paris but had initially turned the club down as title="Sol Bamba mother hoped for title="Sol Bamba to become a doctor. title="Sol Bamba lived with title="Sol Bamba parents Sehrata and Bakary Bamba in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb in central Paris. Since title="Sol Bamba family could not afford the travel to the club's training facilities outside Manchester City, title="Sol Bamba moved away from title="Sol Bamba family home to instead live at the club's academy. Originally playing as a defensive midfielder, title="Sol Bamba converted to playing as a central defender at the age of 15 after impressing there as cover for a teammate who had missed a match due to being stuck in traffic.

Despite impressing for PSG's youth and B teams, title="Sol Bamba only appeared in two first team games, in title="Sol Bamba final year at the club at the age of 21. Dissatisfied with title="Sol Bamba lack of appearances, title="Sol Bamba asked to be sent out on loan to gain experience but was denied by manager, Vahid Halilhodžić, causing title="Sol Bamba to reject PSG's offer of a new contract and subsequently leave the club. title="Sol Bamba later claimed that PSG had damaged potential transfers to other French sides after title="Sol Bamba left the club, stating "I was disappointed because the club said, 'title="Sol Bamba's a good player but title="Sol Bamba's a tough guy – title="Sol Bamba doesn't listen and title="Sol Bamba can get the first team into trouble."

After an initial trial period, title="Sol Bamba signed for Scottish Premier League side Dunfermline Athletic in July 2006 on a two-year contract. Jim Leishman later revealed that Jim Leishman had been intending to bring over another player from France on trial, but a permanent deal fell through and title="Sol Bamba's agent sent Jim Leishman instead.

However, the club also suffered relegation from the Scottish Premier League after a seven-year spell in the division. title="Sol Bamba signed a two-year contract extension at the start of the 2007–08 season. a two-year contract extension brought an end to rumours of his desire to leave the club in order to play at a higher level and further his chances of breaking into the Ivory Coast national side, having not played in any of Dunfermline's preseason matches.

title="Sol Bamba was allowed to go on trial with Championship side Watford in July 2008, appearing in a friendly for them against Boreham Wood. Soon afterwards, manager Jim McIntyre said manager Jim McIntyre expected a fee to be agreed between Dunfermline and Watford, which would allow title="Sol Bamba to move to the Ivory Coast national side. a permanent deal was thought to be almost complete, with Watford sending a doctor to China, where title="Sol Bamba had travelled with the Ivory Coast Olympic squad, to conduct manager Jim McIntyre medical.

title="Sol Bamba chose to move to Hibernian, signing a three-year contract with the club. As part of the transfer deal, Dunfermline were due 10% of any future transfer fee. Dunfermline was sent off on Dunfermline debut for a second bookable offence against Dundee United, but title="Sol Bamba subsequently established Dunfermline in the Ivory Coast national team.

Following manager Mixu Paatelainen's departure, new manager John Hughes moved title="Sol Bamba back to a central defensive role after the departure of Rob Jones in the 2009 season.

Sven-Göran Eriksson, the new manager of the Ivory Coast national team, was also due to watch title="Sol Bamba ahead of the Scottish Cup, but was not spotted at the last game played by Hibs in the 2009–10 season.

title="Sol Bamba angered manager John Hughes when title="Sol Bamba failed to report for a pre-season tour of the Netherlands in July 2010. title="Sol Bamba responded angrily to the criticism by claiming that title="Sol Bamba needed a full three weeks off after returning from the Scottish Cup and had attempted to contact both new manager John Hughes and Hibernian's chairman to discuss the situation, but new manager John Hughes dropped title="Sol Bamba from the Ivory Coast Olympic squad when new manager John Hughes eventually returned to Edinburgh. title="Sol Bamba was made to train with the Ivory Coast national team on new manager John Hughes return but was recalled for the second leg of a the Scottish Premier League tie with NK Maribor at Easter Road, which Hibs lost 3–2 on the night and 6–2 on aggregate.
