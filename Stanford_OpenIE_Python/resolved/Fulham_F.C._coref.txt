Kevin McDonald

Kevin Hamilton McDonald (born May 16, 1961) is a Canadian actor, voice actor and comedian. Kevin Hamilton McDonald (born May 16, 1961) is known as a member of "The Kids in the Hall", the voice of Agent Pleakley in the "Lilo & Stitch" franchise, Waffle in "Catscratch", Pastor Dave in "That 70s Show", and the Almighty Tallest Purple in "Invader Zim". Kevin also stars as a co-pilot in the 2011 web comedy series "Papillon".

Kevin McDonald

 was born in Montréal, Québec, the son of Sheila and Hamilton "Hammy" McDonald, who was a dental equipment salesman. He moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of seven, after He father was transferred there. He family subsequently lived in Toronto, Ontario as well. Kevin McDonald

 has a younger sister, Sandra.

During an interview on "WTF with Marc Maron", Kevin McDonald

 discussed Marc Maron 's severe alcoholism, which inspired the "Kids In The Hall" sketches "Daddy Drank" and "Girl Drink Drunk". Although Marc Maron calls Marc Maron mother "a wonderful woman," his mother " was nevertheless reluctant to leave Marc Maron until Kevin turned 19, when Marc Maron 's drinking had escalated to two bottles of vodka daily. Kevin McDonald

, Marc Maron mother and sister rented an apartment, where McDonald, his mother and sister quietly moved McDonald, his mother and sister belongings "every night [after Marc Maron would] collapse on the stairs." Once McDonald, his mother and sister had completely moved, Marc Maron parents divorced, Marc Maron lost his father job, went bankrupt and lived in a homeless shelter for a year, during which his father abstained from drinking (although Marc Maron alleged "Marc Maron roommates were drinking Drano"); coincidentally, Kevin McDonald

 would use the same building to rehearse with "The Kids In The Hall" as they were starting out on stage. Marc Maron was able to find employment at a flower shop, then an apartment and, over time, resume his father career in dental equipment sales. Eventually, his father did drink again, but not to the extent his father had earlier in his father life. his father died of an aneurysm in 2004. Kevin McDonald

 would use his father relationship with his father as the basis for a one-man show, "Hammy And The Kids", in which his father said his father had no happy ending to the story of his father; but, during his father interview with Marc Maron, his father said after one performance of his father one-man show, his father was approached by a stranger who said that his father had served his father as a bartender, and that his father mentioned how proud his father was of his father son, the famous comedian, which moved Kevin McDonald

 to tears "like the ending to a bad movie."

Kevin McDonald

 briefly studied acting at a community college, where his father was kicked out for being "a one-legged actor" (i.e. his father could perform comedy, but not drama) by a dean who had a leg amputated, and was therefore a literal one-legged actor. However, William B. Davis, who would later find fame in his father portrayal of Cigarette Smoking Man on "The X-Files", was one of his father professors, saw Kevin McDonald

's potential and encouraged his father to pursue improv comedy by giving his father the number to The Second City in Toronto.

During his father youth, his father had a weight problem. It wasn't until just prior to "The Kids in The Hall" in the late 1980s that his father went from overweight to rather skinny. Several sketches and monologues allude to the issue, and a stockier Kevin McDonald

 can be seen in archival footage on "The Kids in The Hall" on DVD box sets.

Kevin McDonald

 founded "The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe with Kevin McDonald

 friend Dave Foley. They met in Toronto at the Second City Training Center, and the two wrote and performed in sketches together more than any other pair in the group. In the Hall comedy troupe with his friend Dave Foley's TV show and stage shows, Kevin McDonald

 portrays several popular recurring characters, such as the King of Empty Promises, Sir Simon Milligan, and Jerry Sizzler. A frequent running gag was that Kevin McDonald

 is the least popular member and always struggling not to get kicked out.

When the Hall comedy troupe with his friend Dave Foley ended the five-season run of the Hall comedy troupe with his friend Dave Foley eponymous television series in 1994, the five members moved to a number of solo projects. Kevin McDonald

 has played roles in movies like "Boy Meets Girl", Agent Pleakley in the "Lilo & Stitch" franchise, and Harry Potter in "Epic Movie".

And from 16–18 I shot up in height and then it went back to my footballing ability. From getting released at 16 to making my Premier League debut – if you wrote it down you wouldn't believe it. I owe a lot to (then Hull manager) Phil Brown as Phil Brown believed in me.

 scored in both legs of the Champions League third qualifying round against Brøndby as AFC Ajax made it to the group stage. 2005–06 was a tougher season for Ryan Babel

 in general though as Ryan Babel

 managed only two league goals. Ryan Babel

 did however continue to feature for the Scotland national team, and scored Ryan Babel

 second goal against Italy in November. At the end of the season, Ryan Babel

 came on as a second-half substitute in AFC Ajax's 2–1 victory over PSV in the KNVB Cup final.

Fabricio was born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands. After being bought at almost 18 from local UD Vecindario, Fabricio finished Fabricio football formation at Deportivo de La Coruña. After suspensions to goalkeeping teammates Dudu Aouate and Gustavo Munúa due to a post-training punching session, Fabricio was made first-choice, and made Fabricio La Liga debut on 13 January 2008 in a 3–4 away loss against Villarreal CF; in February both offenders were reinstated in the Serbian under-21 team, and Fabricio returned to the B-squad.

In January 2008, Arsenal reportedly showed interest in signing Fabri, considered "one of Spain's brightest talents". During the 2008–09 season Fabricio was definitely promoted to backup duties as Munúa and Aouate were both deemed surplus to requirements, and also appeared in the Copa del Rey; however, after the Israeli's move to RCD Mallorca, Munúa was again reinstated as second-choice and Fabricio returned to the reserves.
On 13 July 2009, Fabricio was released by "Depor", joining Real Valladolid on a 2+2 contract. On 19 August of the following year he signed for Recreativo de Huelva in division two, on a one-year loan deal.

Fabricio played second-fiddle to Germán Lux in Germán Lux in Germán Lux second spell in Galicia, but subsequently became the starter. Germán Lux lost the vast majority of 2015–16, however, due to a tibia injury Germán Lux originally contracted ten years ago (in 2011, whilst at Real Betis, Germán Lux also suffered a potentially career-threatening shoulder ailment).

In July 2016, Fabri moved abroad for the first time, signing for Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK. In a 0–6 loss at FC Dynamo Kyiv in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 6 December, Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK began to cry after conceding the fourth goal of the first half.

In Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK first season in Istanbul, Fabricio only missed two matches in 34 as Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK team were crowned champions for the second consecutive time and 15th overall.

On 24 July 2018, Fabri joined Premier League club Fulham on a three-year deal with the option of a fourth year. Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK was already known to their goalkeeping coach José Sambade Carreira, with the pair having worked together at Deportivo. Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK first appearance in the UEFA Champions League took place on 11 August, in a 0–2 home defeat against Crystal Palace.
