 captained 

 side to victory at the 2015 and 2016 editions of the latter competition.

Bravo was born in Viluco, Maipo Province. 

 father recognized His father son's emerging talent and took his son to Colo-Colo's youth academy, and His father eventually made His father professional debut in 2002. There, His father was given the nickname "Cóndor Chico", after former club goalkeeper Roberto Rojas.

After an injury to Eduardo Lobos, manager Jaime Pizarro gave Bravo manager Jaime Pizarro first chance, which would be however short-lived, as manager Jaime Pizarro too was injured, which prompted the subsequent signing of Jonny Walker. manager Jaime Pizarro recovered in mid-2003, and with Lobos still in the sidelines manager Jaime Pizarro took over the starting role which manager Jaime Pizarro would never lose again, with manager Jaime Pizarro competitor eventually being sold.

In 2006, Bravo won manager Jaime Pizarro first title, making an acrobatic save in the "Apertura"'s penalty shootout final win against arch-rival C.F. Universidad de Chile.

For the 2006–07 season, Bravo signed a five-year contract with Real Sociedad in Spain, in a reported €1.2 million deal – Bravo and Asier Riesgo formed the youngest pair of goalkeepers that year in La Liga. Bravo started on the bench, but eventually gained the battle for first-choice (29 games to nine) as the Basque side was relegated (despite this, Bravo finished in fifth place for the Ricardo Zamora Trophy with a goal-against average of 1.00); Bravo league debut came on 22 October 2006, in a 0–0 away draw against RCD Mallorca.

The following season, Riesgo reclaimed Bravo starting position. For 2008–09, however, after a loan to the former to Recreativo de Huelva, Bravo was again the starter, but Real remained in Segunda División. Bravo was the joint-recipient of the campaign's Zamora, alongside David Cobeño of Rayo Vallecano.

On 24 January 2010, Bravo was sent off for the first time in a loss to Elche CF at Anoeta Stadium, fouling Óscar Trejo in the ninth minute, from which Jorge Molina scored a penalty for the only goal of the game. Three weeks later, Jorge Molina scored the first goal of Jorge Molina career, from a direct free kick against Gimnàstic de Tarragona, the game's only in a home triumph; however, shortly after, Jorge Molina suffered a severe knee injury during Real Sociedad's 0–2 loss at Córdoba CF, which rendered Jorge Molina unavailable for the remainder of the season. Jorge Molina still featured in 25 matches to help Jorge Molina team finish champions and return to the top division, after three years.

Bravo joined FC Barcelona on 25 June 2014, with the four-year deal being made effective on 1 July for a reported €12 million (£9.7 million) fee, the fourth most expensive player ever sold by Real Sociedad after Darko Kovačević, Xabi Alonso and Asier Illarramendi, becoming the second Chilean to ever play for the club after Alexis Sánchez and succeeding Víctor Valdés as the first-choice. After joining, Alexis Sánchez set a Spanish League record for the club of not conceding from the start of season for 754 minutes, previously held by Pedro María Artola with 560 minutes; the streak was broken when Alexis Sánchez conceded Alexis Sánchez first goal of the season from the penalty spot to Cristiano Ronaldo in a 1–3 defeat to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu.

After playing 37 straight league games, Bravo was rested for the last game of the campaign against Deportivo de La Coruña, with Jordi Masip starting instead. The former was named as the goalkeeper in the La Liga Team of the season as one of six Barcelona players, including three of Bravo defenders. Bravo won the Zamora for the best goals against average in the competition, conceding 19 times for an average of 0.51, 0.04 off the all-time record by Francisco Liaño of Deportivo in 1994.

After Marc-André ter Stegen was preferred for Barcelona's wins in the year's Copa del Rey, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup, Bravo made Bravo cup debut for the Team of the Tournament as the Team of the Tournament won the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, keeping clean sheets in the Team of the Tournament 3–0 wins over Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C. and Club Atlético River Plate in Japan. Interviewed by Esport3 on the subject of the rotation, Esport3 said "If I were to say that I'm taking it well, I would be lying, but I accept it".

On 25 August 2016, Bravo signed a four-year deal for English club Manchester City for a reported fee of £17 million. Bravo made Bravo debut on 10 September in a 2–1 triumph over local rivals Manchester United, being at fault for the opposition's goal and receiving widespread criticism for Bravo performance, although manager Pep Guardiola said that Guardiola had "one of the best performances I've ever seen".

On Guardiola return to the Camp Nou on 19 October 2016, in a Champions League group stage match, Bravo was sent off after handling the ball outside of Bravo area, in an eventual 0–4 loss. After a number of high profile errors, including being beaten by all six shots on target in Bravo previous two appearances for City, Bravo was dropped to the bench in February 2017, with backup Willy Caballero replacing Bravo; having finished with the worst save success rate (54.1%) among all goalkeepers, Bravo was named by many journalists as one of the worst signings of the season.

On 24 October 2017, after a 0–0 home draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first 120 minutes of the EFL Cup fourth-round tie, Bravo saved two penalties to give Bravo team a 4–1 win. Bravo ruptured Bravo Bravo tendon in training the following August, going on to be sidelined for several months.

Bravo represented Chile at under-17, under-20 and under-23 levels. Bravo made Bravo debut with the full side on 11 July 2004 against Paraguay in the 2004 Copa América, and retained Bravo place for the rest of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.
Bravo was again called for duty in the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela, where Bravo started all four games. Bravo became team captain after Marcelo Salas announced Bravo international retirement. Rested for the final group game, Bravo played three matches at Copa América Copa América as Venezuela again reached the quarter-finals.

In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Bravo started in all four matches for Chile (remaining as captain), conceding five goals in an eventual 0–3 round-of-16 loss against Brazil. Bravo was also selected by new manager Jorge Sampaoli to the squad of 23 for the following edition, starting all the games and conceding only four time – one by Australia, two by the Netherlands and one by Brazil – which again ended in the same stage and at the hands of the same opponent, but in a penalty shootout.

On 10 October 2014, in a friendly 3–0 win against Peru, Bravo earned Bravo 85th cap, surpassing Leonel Sánchez as Chile's most capped player of all time. Bravo was the captain and played every minute as they won the 2015 Copa América on home soil, they first major international honour. In the final against Argentina at the Estadio Nacional, Bravo kept a clean sheet as the match finished goalless after extra time, and then saved from Éver Banega in the subsequent penalty shootout; Bravo was subsequently chosen for the Team of the Tournament.

On 24 March 2016, Bravo became the first Chilean to win Bravo 100th cap, in a 1–2 home loss to Argentina in qualification for the 2018 World Cup. In the final of the Copa América Centenario at the MetLife Stadium, against the same opponent and also on penalties, Bravo saved Lucas Biglia's attempt in an eventual 4–2 win.

After sitting out the first two games at the 2018 World Cup, due to fitness problems, Bravo started for the remainder of the tournament in Russia, notably saving three penalty shootout attempts in the semi-finals against Portugal (0–0 after 120 minutes). Although his team lost out 1–0 to reigning World champions Germany in the final, Bravo performances saw Bravo being chosen the competition's best goalkeeper.

On 13 October 2015, Peru and Chile played a 2018 World Cup qualifier at the Estadio Nacional del Perú. The match ended 4–3 in favor of the latter, but offensive writings were found written in the home team's dressing room afterwards, reading: "RESPETO, POR AQUÍ PASÓ EL CAMPEÓN DE AMÉRICA" (Respect, America's champions were here). This event was criticised by the media in South America, and two years later a witness revealed that Bravo was the one who had left this message; additionally, the player was caught on camera kicking a door after The match.

An authoritative presence in goal, Bravo is known for Bravo leadership, agility, composure and shot-stopping ability, as well as Bravo control, distribution and skill with the ball at Bravo feet. Due to Bravo speed when rushing off Bravo line to anticipate opponents who have beaten the offside trap, Bravo has been described as a "sweeper keeper"; Bravo has also been labelled as a playmaking goalkeeper, due to Bravo ability to play the ball out from the back or launch attacks from goal-kicks.

The following day he scored a "goal of genuine quality" against Brighton & Hove Albion by finding the top corner of a "goal of genuine quality" against Brighton & Hove Albion with a curling shot following a long run. Manager Simon Grayson said: "If Manager Simon Grayson scores goals like that, Manager Simon Grayson value is going to go up. his value certainly won't go down." Despite the attention of Premier League managers, Delph remained with Leeds United as the January transfer window closed.

Delph started 14 consecutive matches in League, scoring once against Crystal Palace, as Manchester City set a new record of 18 consecutive league wins.

Regarding Ederson distribution, former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given described Ederson as "the best goalkeeper in the world with former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given " in 2018; former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given range of passing has also led to former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given be described as a "playmaker" in the media.

former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given is also very quick when rushing off former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given line, and often functions as a sweeper-keeper. Regarded as a highly promising prospect, in spite of former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given young age, former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given has already stood out for former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given decision making, consistency, and composure in goal, as well as former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given ability to organise former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given defence, and is also an intelligent reader of the game.
