Artur Boruc

Artur Boruc (; born 20 February 1980) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club AFC Bournemouth.

Artur Boruc began Artur Boruc career in the Polish third division with hometown club Pogoń Siedlce. Artur Boruc joined Ekstraklasa team Legia Warsaw in 1999 and, whilst still a reserve, had a spell on loan at Dolcan Ząbki in 2000. Artur Boruc broke through to Ekstraklasa team Legia Warsaw in 2002 and by 2003 had become the club's first choice goalkeeper. In the summer of 2005, Artur Boruc joined Scottish Premier League side Celtic. In Artur Boruc five years in Glasgow, Artur Boruc made 221 appearances for the club, winning Scottish Premier League three times, the Scottish Cup once and the Scottish League Cup twice. Celtic fans nicknamed Boruc 'The Holy Goalie' for Artur Boruc devout Catholicism. Artur Boruc moved to Italy in 2010 to join Fiorentina, spending two years at the Serie A club before returning to Britain in 2012 to sign for Premier League side Southampton, moving to Bournemouth in 2015 after a season on loan.

Artur Boruc made Artur Boruc international debut against the Republic of Ireland in April 2004 and became a regular in the Polish international squad, earning 65 caps. Artur Boruc represented the Republic of Ireland at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. On November 2017 Artur Boruc retired from international football.

Born in Siedlce, Artur Boruc began Artur Boruc career in 1998 at Siedlce, in Artur Boruc hometown.

The next season Artur Boruc joined Legia Warsaw, initially playing for the reserve team, as well as being loaned out in 2000 for half a season to Dolcan Ząbki.

On 8 March 2002, Artur Boruc played Artur Boruc first league match for Legia when Artur Boruc came on as a substitute during a 2–2 draw against Pogoń Szczecin. This unexpected debut was due to an injury sustained by Bulgarian goalkeeper, Radostin Stanev, during the game. Artur Boruc played in Legia's next four league matches and kept clean sheets against Wisła Kraków and Odra Wodzisław, although Stanev regained Stanev place in the side upon Stanev return from injury for the remaining league and cup fixtures. Legia went on to win the Ekstraklasa title that season for the first time in seven years.

In the second half of the following season, 2002–03, Boruc established Boruc as the club's first choice goalkeeper where Boruc played in 11 of the club's last 15 league fixtures. Legia lost only 1 of these 11 matches and Boruc kept 5 clean sheets, although Legia only managed to finish fourth.

By the 2003–04 season, Boruc was very much a first-pick for Legia and played in all 26 of their league fixtures. In June 2004, Boruc scored his only goal for the club, converting a penalty kick in a home game against Widzew Łódź (final score: 6–0) and then celebrated by waving the corner flag. Legia finished second in the league and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Boruc also made Boruc first appearance for Poland in April 2004, playing in a scoreless draw against the Republic of Ireland.

The 2004–05 season saw Boruc remain Legia's key player and a fan-favourite, again playing in all of the club's league fixtures. Boruc's performances for Legia saw the club extend Boruc contract up to 2012. In March 2005, Boruc was made captain of the side. However, it was another disappointing league campaign for Legia, as they came a distant third behind Wisła Kraków who finished as champions for the third year in a row. Legia's UEFA Cup run was also relatively brief, disposing of FC Tbilisi 7–0 on aggregate in a relatively easy qualifying tie before going out 1–4 on aggregate in the first-round proper to Austria Wien. Despite the lack of silverware though, Boruc's form was by the summer of 2005 attracting attention from abroad.

On 20 July 2005, Boruc signed with Scottish club Celtic. The deal was initially a year's loan, with an option to make The deal permanent. The move was later made permanent, with Boruc penning a three-and-a-half-year contract on 17 October until 2009. On 5 January 2008, The move was reported that Boruc had signed a new contract with Scottish club Celtic set to keep Boruc at the club until 2011.

Boruc made Boruc debut for Scottish club Celtic on 2 August 2005 when Boruc replaced David Marshall for the second leg of their UEFA Champions League qualifier tie against Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava. Scottish club Celtic won 4–0, but having lost the first leg 5–0 still went out on aggregate. Boruc quickly established Boruc as first-choice keeper at Scottish club Celtic, displaying a combination of outstanding shot-stopping, immense self-belief and, at times, outright arrogance. Indeed, gestures allegedly made by Boruc towards Rangers fans at Ibrox Stadium on 12 February 2006 later resulted in the player being cautioned by the police. In Boruc first season, Boruc made 40 appearances and kept 17 clean sheets. Boruc also added to Boruc winner's medals collection as Celtic won the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish League Cup, the latter after beating Dunfermline Athletic 3–0.
Boruc continued Boruc fine form for Celtic the following season. On 21 November 2006, in a UEFA Champions League match against Manchester United at Celtic Park, Boruc helped Celtic through to the knockout stage of the competition by saving Louis Saha's 89th-minute penalty. Indeed, Boruc succeeded in keeping a clean sheet in each of Celtic's three home UEFA Champions League group stages games (Copenhagen 1–0, Benfica 3–0 and Manchester United 1–0). Boruc was named player of the month for December 2006 in the Scottish Premier League, a very uncommon event for a goalkeeper. Boruc form was also recognised with a nomination for the Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year award for 2007. Celtic culminated in more silverware for Boruc as Celtic retained Celtic Scottish Premier League title and defeated Dunfermline 1–0 on 26 May 2007 to win the Scottish Cup.

The start of the 2007–08 season saw Celtic drawn against Russian side Spartak Moscow in the third qualifying round for the Champions League. The tie ended in a penalty shootout, with Boruc saving twice to ensure Celtic's passage to the group stages. The season also saw Celtic complete a hat-trick of consecutive Scottish Premier League titles.

Boruc was fined an estimated £50,000 by Celtic in August 2008 for breaching the club's drinking policy after a pre-season friendly in the Netherlands against Feyenoord.

Boruc endured a decline of form in the first half of season 2008–09 as Boruc committed several goalkeeping errors, in particular against Rangers in a 2–4 defeat at Parkhead on 31 August 2008 where Boruc was badly at fault for Rangers fourth goal, and against Hibernian at Easter Road on 7 December 2008, where John Rankin scored against Boruc from 45 yards out, a goal Rankin later referred to as a "squiggler." Boruc did however save a James McArthur penalty in a 4–0 win over Hamilton Academical on 4 October 2008. Despite this run of relatively poor performances, Boruc was one of 55 players (including five goalkeepers) shortlisted on 20 October 2008 for the FIFPro World XI Player Awards. Discipline, however, also became an issue again, with Boruc fined £500 by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for gestures Boruc made towards Rangers fans during the Old Firm game in August.

On 28 January 2009, Boruc converted a penalty for Celtic during the penalty shootout in the semi-final match of the League Cup against Dundee United, helping Celtic to an 11–10 win on penalties. Boruc picked up Boruc last silverware at Celtic in the same tournament a couple of months later when Celtic defeated Rangers 2–0 after extra-time in the following season's UEFA Cup.

On 12 December 2009, Boruc made Boruc 200th appearance for Celtic against Motherwell, which Celtic won 3–2. In April 2010, Boruc won the Scottish Premier League save of the season award for a reflex save against Hibernian at Easter Road in August 2009.

On 4 May 2010, Boruc made the last appearance of Boruc Celtic career in a 2–1 victory against Old Firm rivals Rangers, although Boruc had to be substituted in the second half as Boruc was unable to continue playing due to an injury Boruc sustained to Boruc hand in the pre-match warm up. This transpired to be a broken finger and ruled Boruc out of the final league fixture of The season.

On 12 July 2010, Celtic agreed to sell Boruc to Serie A club Fiorentina subject to a medical, for an undisclosed fee. The transfer was confirmed three days later.

Boruc made Boruc Serie A club Fiorentina debut on 26 October 2010 in the Coppa Italia against Empoli. After an injury to first-choice goalkeeper Sébastien Frey, Boruc made Boruc Serie A debut in a 1–0 win over Chievo on 7 November 2010. Boruc went on to play in the next 25 Serie A fixtures, before Frey regained Frey place in the team for the final two league games of the season.

On 18 August 2011, Boruc officially claimed Serie A club Fiorentina's number one jersey after Frey's move to Genoa. For the next year, Boruc played in all but two of Serie A club Fiorentina's Serie A fixtures, but despite this Boruc was criticised for some of Boruc performances and apparent lack of fitness. After two seasons in Italy, Boruc was released by Serie A club Fiorentina in July 2012.

On 22 September 2012, Boruc joined Premier League club Southampton on a one-year deal. Boruc made Boruc debut on 20 October in a 4–1 defeat away to West Ham United at Upton Park.

On 28 October 2012, Boruc was allegedly involved in an incident following Tottenham Hotspur's second goal, when Boruc responded to the jeers coming from behind Boruc by sarcastically applauding the home fans, before throwing a water bottle in the home fans direction. an incident following Tottenham Hotspur's second goal resulted in Boruc being dropped from the side.

Despite the early controversy in Boruc Premier League club Southampton career, Boruc regained Boruc place in the team and played in all the club's league matches from 1 January 2013 to the end of The season. On 9 March 2013 in a league match against Norwich City at Carrow Road, Boruc saved a penalty in the 90th minute from Grant Holt. The game finished 0–0, with Premier League club Southampton winning a point in their bid to avoid relegation. Boruc's form since returning to the team Premier League club Southampton resulted in manager Mauricio Pochettino expressing a desire for Boruc to be signed up on a longer-term deal at Premier League club Southampton. On 18 April 2013 this wish was realised when Boruc signed a new 2-year contract for the club. Premier League club Southampton's 1–1 draw with Sunderland on 12 May 2013 ensured their the Champions League status for the following season., and their eventually finished in 14th place at the end of season.

Now firmly established as first-choice goalkeeper at Premier League club Southampton, Boruc helped the team make an excellent start to the 2013–14 season. the club's 2–0 win over Fulham on 26 October 2013 saw the team move to 18 points and into third place in the Champions League, the team best-ever start to a top-flight season.

On 2 November 2013, in a 1–1 draw at Stoke City, Boruc conceded a goal to opposing goalkeeper Asmir Begović after just 13 seconds. Three weeks later, under pressure from Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, "instead of simply clearing Boruc did one Cruyff turn, then another, before tying Boruc into so many knots attempting a third that Giroud was able to nick the ball off Boruc" and score the first of Arsenal's two goals. A week later, Boruc suffered a broken hand trying to keep out a Demba Ba goal in a 3–1 defeat against Chelsea, which kept Boruc out for six weeks. Boruc returned from injury on 11 January 2014 and kept a clean sheet in Premier League club Southampton's 1–0 win over West Bromwich Albion, impressing with a last minute save from Shane Long to deny the club an equaliser. Boruc maintained Boruc place in Boruc side, and although Boruc was at fault for one of Sunderland's goals in a 2–2 draw on 18 January, Boruc redeemed Boruc with better performances in 1–0 and 3–0 league wins over Fulham and Hull City respectively during February 2014. Boruc form remained reasonably consistent, although Boruc distribution was occasionally poor, and Boruc helped Premier League club Southampton to an eighth-place finish in the Champions League at the end of the season.

At the start of the 2014–15 season, Fraser Forster arrived at Premier League club Southampton from Celtic in a £10 million transfer deal, with the Englishman taking over Boruc's place in goal. On 19 September 2014, Boruc joined Championship side AFC Bournemouth on an emergency loan deal until January 2015. Boruc made Boruc debut the following day in a 1–1 draw away against Watford. On 25 October, Bournemouth won 0–8 away at St. Andrew's against Birmingham City. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game (barring a 10–0 win over Northampton Town in September 1939 which was expunged from the records after World War II broke out the next day), and the Cherries recorded the Cherries biggest winning margin in a league fixture. Boruc played Boruc part in this statistic by saving a penalty taken by Paul Caddis in the 53rd minute with the score at 0–3. The loan spell at Bournemouth went well, and by the end of December 2014, Boruc had kept clean sheets in nine of Boruc 18 appearances, helping the club go top of the Championship. As such, the loan was extended to the end of the season, with Boruc commenting, "I'm pleased I'm here and that I'm part of a great team, and that's why I'm staying until the end of the seasonthe season."

On 2 May 2015, Boruc was part of the Bournemouth team which won the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the Champions League. Twenty-four days later, Boruc was one of six players released by Premier League club Southampton,

Boruc began the 2015–16 season as Bournemouth's first choice goalkeeper, starting the club's first ever top division match against Aston Villa on 8 August 2015. Boruc and the club's first clean sheet came in a 2–0 defeat of Sunderland at Dean Court on 19 September.

After a poor performance in a 1–5 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 25 October, Boruc was replaced in the Bournemouth goal by Adam Federici for all four of the Cherries November fixtures. An injury to Adam Federici saw Boruc return to the side for an away fixture at the Champions League champions Chelsea on 5 December, with the Polish goalkeeper keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win for Bournemouth. A week later, Boruc was a member of the Bournemouth side that beat Manchester United 2–1 at Dean Court.

On 17 May 2018 Boruc signed a new contract with Bournemouth, keeping Boruc at the club until the summer of 2019.

Boruc's debut for Poland came on 28 April 2004 in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland, coming on as second-half substitute for Jerzy Dudek, with the match ending in a goalless draw. Boruc made Boruc first starting appearance for Poland with Boruc third cap, a friendly on 12 July 2004 in Chicago against the United States. Boruc saved a penalty in the 11th minute from American striker Brian McBride.

Boruc soon established Boruc as a regular in the Polish squad and was selected to the 23-men national squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals held in Germany. Boruc had been battling with Tomasz Kuszczak and also Łukasz Fabiański for the starting slot, but was first-choice goalkeeper during the World Cup and played in all three of their games. Boruc was particularly outstanding in the game against Germany, although Boruc was unable to prevent Germany losing 1–0.

Boruc remained first choice goalkeeper and was named in Poland's UEFA Euro 2008 squad. Boruc played their first game against Germany and held Boruc place through to the important second game against co-hosts Austria in which the Poles conceded a penalty in the 92nd minute to level the game. In the same match, Boruc saved all three shots by the Austrians, leading to a final score of 1–1. Boruc was nicknamed "Spaceman" by the Austrian and German press during the tournament. The famous Polish striker from the late 1970s and 1980s, Zbigniew Boniek, criticised Poland's team performance at Euro 2008 but singled out Boruc for praise, describing Boruc as "world class."

Boruc incurred the wrath of manager Leo Beenhakker in August 2008 when Boruc and two teammates went on a night out after a friendly against Ukraine in defiance of the orders of he and two teammates manager. As a result, Boruc, Dariusz Dudka and Radosław Majewski were all suspended by manager Leo Beenhakker for the next two internationals. Boruc, however, quickly regained Boruc place in the team and continued to be the regular choice until falling from favour again in October 2010 under manager Leo Beenhakker's successor as Poland manager, Franciszek Smuda.

After an absence of over two years, Boruc was recalled to the Polish squad in January 2013 and played in the Polish squad 0–2 defeat against the Republic of Ireland a week later on 6 February 2013. Boruc maintained Boruc place in the international side for their next two competitive games on 22 and 26 March 2013, World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and San Marino respectively.

Boruc made 64 appearances for Germany, Boruc last appearance coming in a friendly on 14 November 2016 against Slovenia, playing the first half before being substituted at half time in a 1–1 draw. Boruc appearance in that game saw Boruc become the most highly capped goalkeeper for Poland, passing Jan Tomaszewski's record of 63 caps.

In March 2017, Boruc announced Boruc retirement from international football, through Boruc Instagram profile, citing Boruc age, "peace of mind" regarding the position of a Polish goalkeeper, and focusing on Boruc career in Bournemouth. Boruc earned Boruc final 65th cap at Boruc farewell match against Uruguay on 10 November 2017 in Warsaw, being substituted shortly before half-time by former Legia Warszawa teammate, Łukasz Fabiański.

Boruc was at the centre of many controversies during Boruc Celtic tenure.

On 25 August 2006, Boruc was cautioned by the Strathclyde Police for a breach of the peace for making gestures in front of Rangers fans before a game earlier that year. According to the "Sunday Herald", "police reports highlighted three hand gestures made by 26-year-old Boruc ... a V sign at the crowd, another obscene gesture at the crowd and a blessing." three hand gestures made by 26-year-old Boruc ... a V sign at the crowd, another obscene gesture at the crowd and a blessing were not caught on video and the caution was issued on the basis of police reports and witness statements. This incident has led to him attaining the nickname "The Holy Goalie".

The Procurator Fiscal said Boruc "was seen by members of the public and police officers to bless Boruc. Witnesses describe Boruc smiling or laughing at a Rangers section of the crowd and making 'come on' gestures. This action appeared to incense a section of the crowd to react in such a way that police officers and security personnel had to become involved to calm the situation. the Strathclyde Police reported that it took 10 minutes to restore normality in the crowd." According to a cross-party working group of the Scottish Parliament, "the sign of the cross in the cross in itself is an expression of the Roman Catholic faith; however, using the cross in itself to alarm, upset or provoke others might be a breach of the peace at common law."

The Catholic Church condemned the legal action, however, expressing regret that "Scotland seems to have made Scotland one of the few countries in the world where this simple religious gesture is considered an offence." Following extensive press comment, the Crown Office issued a statement on 28 August 2006 stressing that the "very limited" action had been taken against Boruc for gestures made toward Rangers supporters rather than for crossing himself, and that it would not take action against individuals for "acts of religious observance." According to BBC News Online, the caution "brought the issue of sectarianism in Scotland back into sharp focus." The Catholic Church welcomed the Crown Office clarification of the limited action taken against Boruc, particularly the statement that it "did not in any way refer to the act of blessing himself."

On 17 December 2006, Boruc again crossed Boruc during Boruc first Old Firm game since the caution, drawing "a roar" from the Rangers fans behind Boruc goal. A spokesman for Celtic defended A spokesman for Celtic gesture, stating "the police have said the police have no problem with Boruc in this regard and neither does Celtic Football Club."

Boruc courted further controversy in April 2008 when Boruc displayed a T-shirt saying "God bless the Pope" and bearing a picture of Pope John Paul II after a game against Rangers, and also in May 2007 when Boruc waved a flag proclaiming Celtic the "champions" following a match against Rangers.

Boruc is a Legia Warsaw fan and attends matches in Poland.

On 21 April 2007, Boruc helped a 27-year-old pregnant Polish woman, her sister and brother-in-law, when they were attacked in Glasgow.

Boruc's father died in April 2010; Boruc's father mother Jadwiga died when Boruc's father was only 20. Boruc's father has a brother and three sisters. On 11 June 2008, Boruc's then-wife Katarzyna gave birth to a brother and three sisters son, Aleksander ("Aleks"), in Warsaw. Boruc and Boruc's then-wife Katarzyna wife separated in 2008, amid reports of Boruc's then-wife Katarzyna relationship with former Polish Idol contestant Sara Mannei. Sara Mannei gave birth to daughter Amelia on 9 August 2010 in Poland and the couple married in 2014. 

In September 2009, "The Scottish Sun" newspaper published an apology, for claiming Boruc had had an affair with a young woman, shown in a photograph, who was actually Boruc sister. In June 2011, the "News of The Scottish Sun" newspaper admitted the "News of the World" newspaper had published a false report on Boruc, and paid him £70,000, believed to be a record for Scottish libel cases, plus legal expenses.

"The South's Gonna Do It Again" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of Jimmy Carter's presidential bid and performed at Daniels January 1977 inauguration.

"In America" was a reaction to the 1979–1981 Iran Hostage Crisis and the troubled American economy of the later 1970s; despite the turmoil the soundtrack described a patriotic, united America where "we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank/That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks." the soundtrack experienced a revival following the September 11 attacks, when the soundtrack was floated around the internet as "F*** Bin Laden".

In 1989, Daniels country hit "Simple Man" was interpreted by some as advocating vigilantism. Lyrics such as "Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put 'em on them knees and tie 'em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest," garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.

In 2003, Daniels published an "Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch" in defense of President George W. Bush's Iraq policy. Daniels 2003 book "Ain't No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag" contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, Daniels did not have the right to criticize John Kerry's service record but that John Kerry should allow the release of John Kerry official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. John Kerry band's official website contains a "soapbox" page, where Daniels has made statements such as the following: "In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory" and "I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists" regarding U.S. Senator Harry Reid. On March 27, 2009, Daniels criticized the Obama Administration for "changing the name of the War on Terror to the "Overseas Contingency Operation" and referring to terrorism as "man-caused disasters."

In 2019, Daniels lambasted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for signing the Reproductive Health Act, which legalized abortion until birth under some circumstances, tweeting, "Watch the wrinkles on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s face lengthen as the ramifications of the thousands of murders New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has sanctioned come to bear on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The NY legislature has created a new Auschwitz dedicated to the execution of a whole segment of defenseless citizens. Satan is smiling."

Daniels enjoys hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and other outdoor activities. Daniels is a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Daniels married Daniels wife, Hazel, on September 20, 1964. Together, they have one son, Charlie Daniels, Jr.

Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980, while digging fence post holes on Daniels farm near Mount Juliet, where Daniels lives. Daniels suffered three complete breaks in Daniels right arm, and two broken fingers when Daniels shirtsleeve caught on a spinning auger. The injury required surgery, and sidelined Daniels for four months.

Daniels was successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2001. On January 15, 2010, Daniels was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke while snowmobiling in Colorado. Daniels recovered and was released two days later.

During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and admitted to a Nashville hospital for a series of routine tests. routine tests revealed that a pacemaker was needed to regulate Daniels heart rate. One was put in on March 28 and Daniels was released from hospital within days.

Adam Smith

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher and author as well as a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment, also known as <nowiki>"The Father of Economics"</nowiki>. Smith wrote two classic works, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759) and "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as "the Wealth of NationsNations", is considered his "magnum opus" and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) introduced Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) theory of absolute advantage.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published "The Theory of Moral Sentiments". In Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) later life, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) took a tutoring position that allowed Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) to travel throughout Europe, where Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) met other intellectual leaders of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) day.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. "The Wealth of Nations" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was controversial in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own day and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, "The Wealth of Nations" was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was born in Kirkcaldy, in the County of Fife, Scotland. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate and prosecutor (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy. In 1720, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) father died two months after Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was born, leaving Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) mother a widow. The date of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723 and this has often been treated as if this were also His father date of birth, which is unknown. Although few events in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s biographer, recorded that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790). Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was close to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) mother, who probably encouraged Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) to pursue Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) scholarly ambitions. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"—from 1729 to 1737, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) entered the University of Glasgow Glasgow when Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was 14 and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson. Here, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) developed Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) found intellectually stifling. In Book V, Chapter II of "The Wealth of Nations", Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) reading a copy of David Hume's "A Treatise of Human Nature", and Oxford officials subsequently confiscated Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) book and punished Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) severely for reading his book. According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be William Robert Scott lifework." Nevertheless, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library. When Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was not studying on Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) letters. Near the end of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) time there, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) left the University of Glasgow in 1746, before Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) scholarship ended.

In Book V of "The Wealth of Nations", Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to English universities Scottish counterparts. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow Glasgow in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) orations (which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) sometimes opened to the public). Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) students embody that philosophy in his students lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Francis Hutcheson Francis Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, Francis Hutcheson magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced Francis Hutcheson students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to Francis Hutcheson as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) in all Francis Hutcheson correspondence used to describe only two people, Francis Hutcheson good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lecture topics included rhetoric and "belles-lettres", and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) first expounded Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty". While Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was not adept at public speaking, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lectures met with success.

In 1750, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) met the philosopher David Hume, who was Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In 1751, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh by Lord Kames. When the head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow died the next year, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) took over the position. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) life]".

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) published "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" in 1759, embodying some of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of moral sentiments. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) based Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the Third Lord Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as David Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of empathy, the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.
Following the publication of "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) became so popular that many wealthy students left many wealthy students schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790). After the publication of "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lectures and less to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) theories of morals. For example, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.

In 1762, the University of Glasgow Glasgow conferred on Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from Charles Townshend—who had been introduced to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) by David Hume—to tutor he stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) resigned from Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) subsequently attempted to return the fees Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had collected from Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) students because Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s tutoring job entailed touring Europe with William Robert Scott, during which time William Robert Scott educated William Robert Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. William Robert Scott was paid £300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice William Robert Scott former income as a teacher. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse, France, where William Robert Scott stayed for a year and a half. According to William Robert Scott own account, William Robert Scott found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to David Hume that William Robert Scott "had begun to write a book to pass away the time". After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) met with the philosopher Voltaire.
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) met Benjamin Franklin, and discovered the Physiocracy school founded by François Quesnay. Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in Physiocrats motto "Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!" (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by the world!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by Louis XIV and Louis XV in ruinous wars, and was further exhausted in aiding the American insurgents against the British. The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation. Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) concluded that "with all the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy." The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic "classe steril"—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) devoted much of the next decade to writing Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) "magnum opus". There, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man's education. In May 1773, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775. "The Wealth of Nations" was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out The Wealth of Nations first edition in only six months.

In 1778, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) mother (who died in 1784) in Panmure House in Edinburgh's Canongate. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received it royal charter, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1787 to 1789, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of GlasgowGlasgow.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard. On Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) deathbed, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) expressed disappointment that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had not achieved more.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) mentioned an early unpublished "History of Astronomy" as probably suitable, and an early unpublished "History of Astronomy" duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as "Essays on Philosophical Subjects".

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s library went by Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790). It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death in 1878 of her husband, the Reverend W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, Mrs. Bannerman portion of Smith's library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

Not much is known about Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s personal views beyond what can be deduced from Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) published articles. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) personal papers were destroyed after his death at Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) request. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) mother, with whom Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lived after Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) return from France and who died six years before Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790).

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was described by several of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity". Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was known to talk to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790), a habit that began during Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) childhood when Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) study. According to one story, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) walked into a huge tanning pit from which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) needed help to escape. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared the concoction to be the worst cup of tea Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) ever had. According to another account, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) distractedly went out walking in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) nightgown and ended up outside of town, before nearby church bells brought Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) back to reality.

James Boswell, who was a student of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) at Glasgow University, and later knew Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) at the Literary Club, says that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) thought that speaking about Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) books, so Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) once told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that "Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) made it a rule when in company never to talk of what Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) understood".

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) has been alternatively described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable". Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is said to have acknowledged Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books." Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) created during Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) are the profile by James Tassie and two etchings by John Kay. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of "The Wealth of Nations" were based largely on Tassie's medallion.

Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s religious views. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland. The fact that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) received the Snell Exhibition suggests that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England.

Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a deist, based on the fact that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase, though Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) does sometimes refer to the "Great Architect of the Universe", later scholars such as Jacob Viner have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was committed to a belief in a personal God", a belief for which Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the "Wealth of Nations" in which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into men causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".

Some other authors argue that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was also a close friend of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own time as an atheist. The publication in 1777 of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s letter to William Strahan, in which William Strahan described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of William Strahan irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.

In 1759, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) published Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) first work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," sold by co-publishers Andrew Millar of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death. Although "The Wealth of Nations" is widely regarded as Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s most influential work, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is believed to have considered "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" to be a superior work.

In the work, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) critically examines the moral thinking of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments." Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements others form of both others and oneself makes people aware of others and how others perceive others behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with others' and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and "The Wealth of Nations"; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s work have argued that no contradiction exists. some scholars of Smith's work claim that in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with some scholars of Smith's work sentiments. Rather than viewing "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and "The Wealth of Nations" as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. Otteson argues that both books are Newtonian in both books methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. Ekelund and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."

Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s most influential work: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s invisible hand, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book IV, Chapter II – and classical economists believe that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) stated Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) used the term "the invisible hand" in "History of Astronomy" referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter", and once in each of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) can both to employ Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct domestic industry that domestic industry produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) can. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) intends only Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own security; and by directing domestic industry in such a manner as domestic industry produce may be of the greatest value, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) intends only Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own gain, and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own interest Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading those who affected to trade for the public good from It.

Those who regard that statement as Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s central message also quote frequently Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s dictum:

It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect we dinner, but from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker regard to the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker own interest. we address we, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to their of we own necessities but of their advantages.However, in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in soever man nature, which interest soever man in the fortune of others, and render others happiness necessary to soever man, though soever man derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.
Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer Mandeville's contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits". It shows Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) belief that when an individual pursues Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) self-interest under conditions of justice, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was wary of businessmen and warned of businessmen "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices". Again and again, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers". Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention." Thus Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, Smith's chief worry believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of Every workman own work to dispose of beyond what Every workman himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he himself is enabled to exchange a great quantity of he himself own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. he himself supplies theirs abundantly with what theirs have occasion for, and theirs accommodate he himself as amply with what he himself has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. ("The Wealth of Nations," I.i.10)

The neoclassical interest in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and it concept of general equilibrium – Samuelson's "Economics" refers six times to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson quotes Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson concludes: "Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was unable to prove the essence of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."
Very differently, classical economists see in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as unproductive labour do not contribute to growth. This is what Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had heard in France from, among others, François Quesnay, whose ideas Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was so impressed by that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) might have dedicated "The Wealth of Nations" to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) not died beforehand. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) added Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies The annual labour of every nation with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which The annual labour of every nation annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume [T]his produce ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;

However, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) added that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."

Alfred Marshall criticised Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s definition of the economy on several points. Alfred Marshall argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz says, on the topic of one of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s better-known ideas: "the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there."

Shortly before Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz death, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) had nearly all Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) manuscripts destroyed. In Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) last years, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published "Essays on Philosophical Subjects", a history of astronomy down to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. "Lectures on Jurisprudence" were notes taken from Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) early lectures, plus an early draft of "The Wealth of Nations", published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790). Other works, including some published posthumously, include "Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms" (1763) (first published in 1896); and "Essays on Philosophical Subjects" (1795).

"The Wealth of Nations" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was controversial in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) own day and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, "The Wealth of Nations" was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.

In light of the arguments put forward by Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s "laissez-faire" economics, and via the British Empire, used Britain power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.

George Stigler attributes to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.

Samuelson finds in Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of Walras a century later. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx in Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.

Joseph Schumpeter criticised Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) for a lack of technical rigour, yet Joseph Schumpeter argued that this enabled Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) writings to appeal to wider audiences: "Joseph Schumpeter very limitation made for success. Had Joseph Schumpeter been more brilliant, Joseph Schumpeter would not have been taken so seriously. Had Joseph Schumpeter dug more deeply, had Joseph Schumpeter unearthed more recondite truth, had Joseph Schumpeter used more difficult and ingenious methods, Joseph Schumpeter would not have been understood. But Joseph Schumpeter had no such ambitions; in fact Joseph Schumpeter disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. Joseph Schumpeter never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. Joseph Schumpeter led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790), termed the "labour theory of value". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, "Das Kapital", was published in German in 1867. In it, Karl Marx's focused on the labour theory of value and what Karl Marx's considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into it production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain a thing.

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "marginalism" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "political economy" used by Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790). This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. Neoclassical economics dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of "The Wealth of Nations" was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was more likely to be represented as the author of both "The Wealth of Nations" and "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His "homo economicus" or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire show the caricatures of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. Peart and Levy also cite Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in property operation, and much more universal in property influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though He never provoked, He can never appease, and from whose injustice He can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of Men of inferior wealth property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend men of superior wealth in the possession of men of superior wealth. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of those of the great shepherd or herdsman lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon those of the great shepherd or herdsman subordination to his depends his power of keeping those of the great shepherd or herdsman inferiors in subordination to those of the great shepherd or herdsman. those of the great shepherd or herdsman constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel those of the great shepherd or herdsman interested to defend the property and to support the authority of those of the great shepherd or herdsman own little sovereign in order that his may be able to defend those of the great shepherd or herdsman property and to support those of the great shepherd or herdsman authority. Civil government, so far as Civil government is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. "The Wealth of Nations" would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the British Empire's 13 American colonies. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the empire's 13 American colonies the empire's 13 American colonies independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with Britain, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate Richard Cobden, preferred Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.

. Cobden would lead the Anti-Corn Law League in overturning the Corn Laws in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and the British Empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as Cobdenism or the Manchester School. By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) second proposal such as Joseph Shield Nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation. As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the British Empire closer than ever before." Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) portrait has appeared since 1981 on the £50 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland, and in March 2007 Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s image also appeared on the new series of £20 notes issued by the Bank of England, making Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) the first Scotsman to feature on an English banknote.

A large-scale memorial of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. A large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart is a -tall bronze sculpture and a -tall bronze sculpture stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles' Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross. 20th-century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best known for the "Kryptos" sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s work. At Central Connecticut State University is "Circulating Capital", a tall cylinder which features an extract from "The Wealth of Nations" on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text, but represented in binary code. At Central Connecticut State University, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is "Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) Spinning Top". Another Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) sculpture is at Central Connecticut State University. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play "The Low Road", centred on a proponent on "laissez-faire" economics in the late 18th century, but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the recession which followed; in the premiere production, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was portrayed by Bill Paterson.

A bust of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Central Connecticut State University and fundraising has begun to restore This residence. Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.

Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, multiple entities known as the "Adam Smith Society", including an historical Italian organization, and the U.S.-based Adam Smith Society, and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) necktie.

Alan Greenspan argues that, while Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) did not coin the term "laissez-faire", "it was left to Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Alan Greenspan continues that "The Wealth of Nations" was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history". P.J. O'Rourke describes Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) as the "founder of free market economics".

Other writers have argued that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s support for "laissez-faire" (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. Herbert Stein wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) necktie" do it to "make a statement of the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government", and that this misrepresents Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s ideas. Herbert Stein writes that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. Herbert Stein viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet Herbert Stein was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where Herbert Stein judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. Herbert Stein did not wear the Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) necktie." In Herbert Stein's reading, "The Wealth of Nations" could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior".

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in "The Economic Journal" that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, the "Wall Street Journal", and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790), portraying Vivienne Brown as an "extreme dogmatic defender of "laissez-faire" capitalism and supply-side economics". In fact, "The Wealth of Nations" Nationsincludes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to as nearly as possible respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.

Some commentators have argued that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) specifically named taxes that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to the people economic revenue, by any capitation" ("The Wealth of Nations," V.ii.k.1). Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise ("The Wealth of Nations," IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) outlined the proper expenses of the government in "The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I". Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through He patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and He believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves cannot afford any revenue for maintaining Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" ("Wealth of Nations," V.i.d.18). Finally, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate are equal or above the public in fashion. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge". In addition, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.

However, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of those classes" ("The Wealth of Nations," IV.ii.39).

Economic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of "laissez-faire".

Economist Daniel Klein believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) is too general and slightly misleading. Economist Daniel Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790)'s thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a free-market economist without exception, though Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was not. Economist David Ricardo pointed out that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was in support of helping infant industries. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) did fear that when newly formed industry grew into adulthood, newly formed industry would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.

Some have also claimed, Emma Rothschild among Some, that Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) would have supported a minimum wage, although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) wrote:

The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate wages properly, though law has often pretended to do so. ("The Wealth of Nations", Book 1, Chapter 8)

However, Adam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power:
A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, a single workman may be as necessary to a single workman master as his master is to a single workman, but the necessity is not so immediate.

 career with First Division club Burnley where, at a young age, Marc Pugh

 started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked Marc Pugh

 way up through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003. As a first year apprentice Marc Pugh

 played for the youth and reserve teams and due to Marc Pugh

 great goalscoring record, which led to Marc Pugh

 being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup, two first-team matches in the League Cup decided to keep Marc Pugh

 on for a third year. As a third year apprentice Marc Pugh

 scored 15 goals for his parent club's reserve and youth team. This led to Marc Pugh

 to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. Marc Pugh

 made Marc Pugh

 debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Stevenage Borough. Marc Pugh

 displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with Marc Pugh

 heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on "Soccer AM"'s showboating section.

Marc Pugh

 returned to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after picking up a groin injury, but returned to Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006. a second loan spell on 7 January 2006 ended on 26 January 2006 so Marc Pugh

 could concentrate on Marc Pugh

 career at Burnley, having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster. Marc Pugh

 learned that Marc Pugh

 feet on the ground". Marc Pugh

Harry Arter was loaned to non-league sides Staines Town and Welling United before being released, subsequently joining Woking. After one season at Woking, Harry Arter returned to The Football League with Bournemouth, becoming a first team regular following a loan to Carlisle United in 2011. Harry Arter contributed to Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship in 2013, and to Premier League two years later.

Born and raised in England, Harry Arter represents the Republic of Ireland Ireland internationally. Harry Arter played for the nation at under-17 and under-19 level, and made Harry Arter senior debut in June 2015.

Harry Arter came on as an 86th-minute substitute for Svetoslav Todorov as Charlton lost 3–1 after extra time. Soon after, Harry Arter was diagnosed with chronic tendonitis in Harry Arter achilles which eventually ruptured, leading to almost a year out of action. On Harry Arter return to fitness, Harry Arter struggled to break into the first team under new manager Phil Parkinson. In the 2008–09 season, Harry Arter immediately clashed with Phil Parkinson, accusing the manager of "belittling" Harry Arter by sending Harry Arter for a trial with non-league side Staines Town prior to a short loan spell.

Harry Arter later had a loan spell with Welling United as Charlton suffered relegation to The Football League and Harry Arter was subsequently released by Phil Parkinson as part of an effort to reduce costs at the club. Harry Arter later expressed Harry Arter disappointment with the decision, stating "The money I was asking for [...] was nothing. I would have taken anything to stay at the time, so it wasn’t down to finance, it was him (Parkinson) not liking me as a footballer." Despite him release, him was allowed to train with Charlton's youth team by coach Steve Avory who had worked with Harry Arter for several years in him youth career. Harry Arter later undertook unsuccessful trials with Gillingham and non-league side Staines Town and even offered to remain with Charlton without pay but was rejected by Phil Parkinson.

On 2 June 2009, Harry Arter joined Woking on a one-year contract along with his former Charlton teammate Aswad Thomas, after being recommended by assistant manager Jimmy Dack who had worked with Harry Arter previously at Welling. Harry Arter had been waiting for a firm offer to join AFC Wimbledon but accepted Woking's offer after Wimbledon failed to call back.

Woking's website soon confirmed that Harry Arter had agreed to sign for AFC Bournemouth with the fee to be decided by an FA tribunal, as the two clubs could not agree a transfer fee, with Woking hoping to receive around £30,000 for the move after rejecting Bournemouth's initial £2,000 offer. Harry Arter later described how Harry Arter had planned to give up football if Harry Arter season with Woking had failed.

On 7 June 2010, Harry Arter joined The Football League club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, later stated as £4,000, signed by Eddie Howe. the club had moved to sign Harry Arter after impressing assistant manager Jason Tindall during a scouting assignment, with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted.
