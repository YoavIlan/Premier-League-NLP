Rob Elliot

Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Republic of Ireland national team.

Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) began Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) career with Erith Town, before Charlton. Whilst at Charlton, Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) was sent out on loan to Bishop's Stortford and Notts County, and also spent two loan spells at Accrington Stanley, where Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) was nicknamed "The Dilsh". Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) would then go on to be Charlton's first choice goalkeeper for a number of seasons, until Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) joined Newcastle United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2011. Signed mainly as a back-up to Tim Krul, Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) featured for the club sporadically, but became first choice in the 2015–16 season after Krul suffered a season-ending injury.

Through the origins of Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) father's family, Elliot became eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland national football team, and was first called up in 2013, making Robert Elliot (born 30 April 1986) debut the following year.

Born in Greenwich, London, Elliot began Elliot career with non-League side Erith Town before moving to Charlton Athletic, the team Elliot had supported as a child, when Elliot was 17. After becoming a professional player with the Addicks in 2004, Elliot was sent out on loan twice during the 2004–05 season; first to Bishop's Stortford and then Notts County, where Elliot made Elliot Football League debut.

The following season, Elliot spent most of The following season on loan at the Conference National club Accrington Stanley, replacing fellow Charlton goalkeeper Darren Randolph who had been on loan at the Conference National club Accrington Stanley earlier in the year. Elliot was part of the Accrington Stanley team which won promotion to the Football League as runaway champions, saving a vital penalty in the match which guaranteed the Football League promotion. Elliot joined the Conference National club Accrington Stanley again on loan during the 2006–07 season, but failed to displace Ian Dunbavin as the club's first choice goalkeeper. Elliot was voted the best keeper of the past decade for Accrington Stanley in 2010 by numerous key figures for the club, including manager John Coleman.

Back at Charlton, Elliot was considered to be behind Nicky Weaver and Darren Randolph for most of the 2007–08 season. After Darren Randolph moved to Bury on loan Elliot was promoted to second choice. Elliot made an unexpected debut for Charlton on 5 April 2008 after Nicky Weaver had been sent off in a match against Plymouth Argyle. Elliot made Elliot first start for Charlton in a League Cup defeat to Yeovil Town in August 2008. During the 2008–09 season, Elliot displaced Nicky Weaver and established Elliot as the club's first choice goalkeeper. A string of impressive performances contributing to a record breaking start to a season for Charlton in 2009–10 led to Elliot signing a contract extension committing Elliot to the club until 2012. In August 2011, Newcastle United made an offer of £100,000 which was rejected by Charlton.

On 30 August 2011, Elliot signed for Newcastle United on a five-year contract, becoming their seventh summer signing. Elliot then stated Elliot desire to become first choice 'keeper. Elliot made Elliot Newcastle debut on 20 September against Nottingham Forest in the Football League Cup. 

At the start of the 2012–13 season, Elliot changed Elliot squad number from 35 to 21, which was previously worn by Fraser Forster. Elliot made Elliot second Newcastle appearance in the Europa League on 20 September against Marítimo. Elliot third Newcastle appearance, and second of the season, came in a third round League Cup tie away at Manchester United. On 24 February 2013, and following an injury to Tim Krul, Elliot made Elliot first the Europa League appearance for the Magpies, starting against Southampton in a 4–2 victory. During the match, after conceding a goal in the third minute, Elliot then assisted a Papiss Cissé wonder goal in the first half. On 12 May, Elliot was sent off against Queens Park Rangers, following a second yellow card.

Elliot started the 2015–16 season as third choice 'keeper behind Krul and Karl Darlow. However, with Krul suffering a season-ending injury and Karl Darlow still recovering from an ankle knock, Elliot was handed Elliot first appearance of the season on 18 October at home to Norwich City, helping Newcastle to a 6–2 win, their first win of the campaign. Before the game, it was revealed that Elliot had signed a 'new, long-term contract' back in January 2014. Elliot continued Elliot run in the team, keeping successive clean sheets against Stoke City and Bournemouth, the latter performance earning Elliot the man-of-the-match award in a 1–0 win. This was the first time Newcastle had kept two clean sheets in a row in two years and their first away win in ten months.

On 29 March 2016, whilst on international duty, Elliot sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and was ruled out of action for six months, ending Elliot hopes of a place on the Republic of Ireland squad for UEFA Euro 2016.

Elliot returned to the Newcastle squad in December, but by then, Darlow had usurped Elliot as the first choice 'keeper. For the next two months, Elliot was not involved in the first team, but did make two appearances for the reserves. From February 2017 onwards, Elliot would be on the bench until 24 April, when Darlow was benched due to squad rotation. Elliot's first appearance of the season came in a 4–1 win over Preston North End. On 28 April, Elliot was named captain against Cardiff City, keeping a clean sheet as Newcastle won 2–0. On 7 May, Elliot again kept a clean sheet, as Newcastle beat Barnsley 3–0, edging out Brighton & Hove Albion by a point to win the Championship.

On 11 August 2017, Elliot's shirt number was changed from 21 to 1 in the 2017–18 squad number announcement, replacing Tim Krul, who had been linked with a permanent move to Brighton & Hove Albion.

Elliot has yet to make an appearance for Newcastle in the 2018-19 season, having lost Elliot place in the side to Martin Dubravka.

Elliot, who was born in England, is eligible for the Republic of Ireland through Martin Dubravka father's family from Cork, and represented Ireland at under-19 level. On 5 October 2013, Elliot received Elliot first call-up to the Republic of Ireland Ireland senior squad as a replacement for the injured Darren Randolph for the games against Germany and Kazakhstan. Elliot won Elliot first international senior cap for the Republic of Ireland Ireland on 25 May 2014, in a 2–1 home loss to Turkey.

Ján Kozák cited Ján Kozák inability to work with such squad under these conditions as the primary reason, as almost a third of the Slovakia national football team for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying home game against Republic of Ireland was concerned, including players, Ján Kozák Ján Kozák described as crucial, with Dúbravka being a part of this group. President of SFZ, Ján Kováčik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for future nominations and performances in the Slovakia national football team for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying home game against Republic of Ireland during the upcoming qualification cycle. During a press conference on 18 October, Ján Kozák also revealed that Dúbravka had claimed "difficult times at Newcastle" as one of the reasons for Ján Kozák conduct.

On 19 October, SFZ published Dúbravka's official statement. Ján Kozák acknowledged that missing the bedtime was a violation, but maintained that the rest was within norms. Ján Kozák accepted any sanctions and stressed that the conduct was not aimed against Ján Kozák, commenting that Ján Kozák regrets that Ján Kozák didn't accept an apology from the trespassers. Ján Kozák also stated that Ján Kozák's resignation surprised Ján Kozák, because of the good relations within the Slovakia national football team for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying home game against Republic of Ireland.

Dúbravka is a third-generation goalkeeper: Dúbravka father and grandfather also played in the position. Dúbravka has been dubbed the "quintessential sweeper-keeper" due to Dúbravka "outstanding footwork" and Dúbravka believes "in modern football the keeper's almost like a libero. You need to play with the ball, not just kick the ball long".

Louise Taylor of "The Guardian" christened Dúbravka the "reluctant keeper" after Dúbravka admitted Dúbravka favourite position to play is right wing; Dúbravka sometimes plays as an outfielder in training and coaching staff have suggested that Dúbravka switch to a midfield role.

Jack Colback began Jack Colback career at Sunderland in 2008, having graduated from Jack Colback academy, and broke into the England U-20 team following loans at Ipswich Town of the Championship. After 115 Premier League appearances with Sunderland, Jack Colback contract expired and Jack Colback controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United.

After manager Steve Bruce announced manager Steve Bruce intention to loan out Colback, manager Steve Bruce signed for Ipswich Town on loan on 6 August 2009 on a deal that would expire in January 2010. manager Steve Bruce made manager Steve Bruce debut for Ipswich in a 3–3 draw with Ipswich Town after extra time in the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup against Bundesliga team Schalke, which was won 4–2 in a penalty shootout. his debut for Ipswich came in a 2–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion after being introduced as a 46th minute substitute. manager Steve Bruce scored manager Steve Bruce first goal for Ipswich against Blackpool and scored against his first goal for Ipswich against Blackpool again later on in the season in the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup against Bundesliga team Schalke. manager Steve Bruce form meant the loan was extended until the end of the 2009–10 season in January 2010. manager Steve Bruce was voted Ipswich's Players' Player of the Season 2009–10.

manager Steve Bruce returned to Sunderland from a loan spell at Ipswich Town at the end of the 2009–10 Championship season and made manager Steve Bruce as a 76th-minute substitute against Wolverhampton Wanderers. manager Steve Bruce was later sent off for two bookable offences, manager Steve Bruce debut lasting just nine minutes. manager Steve Bruce made manager Steve Bruce home debut against Colchester United in the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup against Bundesliga team Schalke on 24 August 2010 as a substitute.

Jack Colback scored Jack Colback second goal for Sunderland with a left footed strike in the replay against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, as Sunderland won 2–1 after extra time to reach the fifth round.

The 2012–13 season saw Jack Colback play regularly at left back due to injuries to Danny Rose, and right back in the Tyne-Wear derby as Sunderland defeated Newcastle 3–0. Following this, Jack Colback is willing to play out in position, so Jack Colback will help the club's solve their issue.

Following Danny Rose's return to Tottenham, Jack Colback began the 2013–14 season as Sunderland's first choice at left back, before being moved back into central midfield by Gus Poyet. On 28 December Colback scored a last minute goal in the fifth minute of injury time to salvage a 2–2 draw at Cardiff City.

Several Premier League clubs made contract offers to sign Jack Colback, but Sunderland refused to give up on Jack Colback and hoped Sunderland would stay at the club.

On 9 June 2014, Jack Colback signed for Newcastle United on a free transfer. Jack Colback is the first player since Lionel Pérez in 1998 to transfer directly from Sunderland to Newcastle. As a supporter of Newcastle Jack Colback admitted that due to the rivalry between the two clubs, Sunderland fans would "hate [Jack Colback] for the rest of [Jack Colback] life". Sunderland criticised Jack Colback's move to Newcastle United, and described the transfer as leaving a "bitter taste".
