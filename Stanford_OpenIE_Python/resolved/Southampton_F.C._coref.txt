At the start of the 2009–10 season McCarthy joined League One club Yeovil on an initial six-month loan and made McCarthy on 8 August in a 2–0 home win over Tranmere Rovers. A month later McCarthy received the first sending-off of McCarthy career after fouling Stockport County's Nicholas Bignall, who was also on loan from Reading. McCarthy's loan spell was renewed in January 2010 and again in February, before being extended for the rest of the season on 24 March. Over the course of McCarthy's loan spell McCarthy played 44 league matches and kept all 12 of Yeovil's clean sheets. Following McCarthy successful loan, McCarthy was given a new three-year contract at Reading, keeping McCarthy with the club until 2013. McCarthy again departed on loan in August 2010, joining Brentford, though McCarthy remained there for just one month before being replaced by fellow Reading loanee Ben Hamer.

After returning from loan at Brentford in September 2010, McCarthy spent the next five months on the bench as cover for Adam Federici. McCarthy eventually made McCarthy Reading debut on 19 February 2011, coming on as a substitute for the injured Adam Federici in the 84th minute against Watford and helping to secure a 1–1 draw.

Despite another strong display in the next round against Manchester City at Eastlands, Reading lost the match 1–0 to a Micah Richards header. Micah Richards continued in goal until 30 April when Micah Richards was displaced by a fit again Federici for the 0–0 draw at Manchester City and remained an unused substitute during Reading's play-off campaign.

With Federici remaining the first choice Reading goalkeeper for the 2011–12 season, Micah Richards was loaned to Leeds United for a month on 4 November to gain Championship experience. An injury to Andy Lonergan and the indifferent form of Paul Rachubka saw Paul Rachubka go straight into the team for the match against Leicester City. Paul Rachubka kept a clean sheet on debut as the match against Leicester City ended in a 1–0 win. Further clean sheets against Nottingham Forest and Millwall followed and were enough to keep Paul Rachubka in the team ahead of Andy Lonergan. In the last match of Paul Rachubka initial spell Paul Rachubka saved an injury time penalty against Watford, allowing Leeds to rescue a point with a last minute equaliser. Following the match against Leicester City, Paul Rachubka revealed that Paul Rachubka was keen on extending Paul Rachubka loan at Leeds, with Reading agreeing to renew it for a second month two days later.

After 10 appearances, all coming in the league, his returned to Reading at the end of the season.

Again starting the season as second choice goalkeeper, several mistakes and an injury meant McCarthy replaced Adam Federici for the 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 16 September 2012. After debuting in the Premier League, his achieved the feat of playing in the six top levels of English football at the age of 22. his retained his place in the team for the next few matches and put in an impressive performance against Swansea City on 6 October leading to suggestions of a senior England call up in the future. his good form continued with a man of the match performance in Reading's next match against Queens Park Rangers, firstly tipping Esteban Granero's free-kick onto the crossbar before saving from Adel Taarabt at close range. The match ended badly though as his injured his colliding with the goal post after diving to stop a Adel Taarabt shot. Despite initial hopes the injury was not too serious, his was forced to undergo shoulder surgery in early December potentially ruling his out for remainder of the season. his recovered quicker than expected though and returned to the team on 13 April 2013, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with Liverpool. After making ten saves during the match, his was widely praised with his performance described as "fantastic" by Nigel Adkins and "absolutely staggering" by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. his remained in goal for the rest of the season, making 14 appearances in total.

On 27 June 2018, McCarthy signed a new four-year contract with the club, keeping McCarthy on their books until 2020, and making McCarthy one of their highest earning players, reflecting McCarthy status as first-choice keeper.

McCarthy trained with the England under-19s before joining the under-21 set-up for the first time in September 2009. McCarthy received several further call-ups to the under-21s in 2009–10 and eventually made McCarthy debut as a second-half substitute against Uzbekistan in August 2010. In March 2011 McCarthy was named in a 31-man squad to face Denmark and Iceland as preparation for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. McCarthy played a full 90 minutes in the first match and 45 in the second as England won 4–0 and lost 2–1 respectively.

Nathan Redmond

Nathan Redmond

 is an English professional footballer who plays for club Southampton and the English national team.

Nathan Redmond

 began Nathan Redmond

 career as a youngster with Birmingham City, Nathan Redmond

 hometown club. Nathan Redmond

 made Nathan Redmond

 first-team debut in the 2015 African Cup of Nations the 2015 African Cup of Nations second-round tie against Rochdale in August 2010, becoming the club's second-youngest player ever at the age of 16 years and 173 days. After representing England at levels up to under-19, Nathan Redmond

 made Nathan Redmond

 first under-21 debut in the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals. Nathan Redmond

 joined Premier League club Norwich City in the 2013 close season, before making the switch to Southampton from Norwich in the 2016 close season.

Nathan Redmond

 typically plays as a wide midfielder. Nathan Redmond

 is right-footed, but has regularly played on both right and left wings, often cutting inside. Nathan Redmond

 has also occasionally played in the centre behind a lone striker.

Nathan Redmond

 was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, of Irish and Jamaican descent. Nathan Redmond

 grew up in the Kitts Green district, attending the Oval Primary School in Yardley and then Sheldon Heath Community Arts College. According to the player's "Facebook" page, Nathan Redmond

 was first noticed by Birmingham City's Academy scouts as an eight-year-old while playing alongside older boys, and scored a hat-trick in Nathan Redmond

 first match for the club's under-10 team.

Nathan Redmond

 scored three goals as Birmingham's under-15 team reached the semi-final of the Nike Premier Cup for the first time in April 2009, and in the same season played in the club's under-18 academy team.

In the 2009–10 season, while still a schoolboy, Nathan Redmond

 made 15 appearances, scoring 3 times, for the academy under-18s. Nathan Redmond

 also made a few substitute appearances for the reserve team, including a "lively late performance" against Aston Villa in early March 2010. Nathan Redmond

 was given a first-team squad number and named on standby for the Premier League match at home to Everton a couple of days later, but did not make the 18-man squad. Nathan Redmond

 was an unused substitute for Birmingham's final home match of the 2009–10 season, aged 16 years and 56 days. Had Nathan Redmond

 taken the field, Nathan Redmond

 would have become the club's youngest first-team player and also the youngest ever Premier League player, at nine days younger than the record set by Fulham's Matthew Briggs in 2007.

Academy manager Terry Westley described Academy manager Terry Westley in June 2010 as "one of those wingers like an Aaron Lennon or Ashley Young. Academy manager Terry Westley has got pace and can run the ball past defenders and has the creativity to go with it", and confirmed that other clubs had shown an interest in Academy manager Terry Westley. Academy manager Terry Westley signed a scholarship contract with Birmingham City in July 2010.

Nathan Redmond

 made Academy manager Terry Westley first-team debut for Birmingham in the League Cup second-round tie against Rochdale on 26 August 2010, replacing Spanish midfielder Enric Vallès in the 78th minute. At 16 years and 173 days34 days older than Trevor Francis was on Trevor Francis debuthe became the club's second-youngest player ever. Manager Alex McLeish was highly complimentary about Manager Alex McLeish brief appearance:

To gain first-team experience, Nathan Redmond

 joined League Two club Burton Albion in January 2011 on a month's Football League youth loan, an arrangement which allows the player to appear in junior matches for Birmingham when not required by the loaning club. However the move was cancelled a few days later when the Football League, who had initially ratified the deal, realised that the rules forbade a first-year scholar from signing on loan for a League club. He made two more substitute appearances for Birmingham that season, one in the League Cup and one in the League Cup, and signed a three-year professional contract as soon as He turned 17, in March 2011.

On He return from the Nike Premier Cup, Nathan Redmond

 started Birmingham's first pre-season friendly match, a 1–0 defeat of Cork City. New manager Chris Hughton suggested New manager Chris Hughton had done well, given New manager Chris Hughton youth: "In particular I thought Nathan Redmond

 did very well. We have to remember New manager Chris Hughton's only 17 years of age. New manager Chris Hughton showed some good touches although the final bit let New manager Chris Hughton down a little." In the absence of fellow midfielders Keith Fahey, Morgaro Gomis and Jordon Mutch, Nathan Redmond

 played the whole of the Europa League play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional, the first time New manager Chris Hughton had completed 90 minutes in a senior match and the first time New manager Chris Hughton club had participated in major European competition for nearly 50 years. New manager Chris Hughton driven shot from outside the penalty area was pushed aside by goalkeeper Elisson and led to Chris Wood heading against the crossbar. New manager Chris Hughton made New manager Chris Hughton Europa League debut three days later, again playing the whole match, in a 3–1 defeat at Middlesbrough. In the second leg against Nacional, Nathan Redmond

 opened the scoring with a low drive from , which was in contention for the club's goal of the season, and later hit the post with a curled shot in a man-of-the-match performance as Birmingham won 3–0 to progress to the group stage.

Nathan Redmond

's first league goal came in a 3–0 win at home to Blackpool on 31 December 2011 as he "smashed an unstoppable shot from just outside the penalty area that beat Howard at he near post". he second, "thumped in ... from 12 yards in stoppage time" completed a 6–0 win away against a nine-man Millwall team. Nathan Redmond

 opened the scoring with a shot from the edge of the penalty area as Birmingham went on to beat Sheffield United 4–0 to progress to the fifth round of the Nike Premier Cup, and came off the bench to score a "stunning" 86th-minute swivelled volley to give Birmingham a 1–0 win against Portsmouth that took them to third place in the table. the club's acting chairman finished the season with seven goals from 37 appearances in all competitions, and won the club's Young Player of the Year award.

Ahead of the new season, the club's acting chairman insisted that, despite financial problems, neither Nathan Redmond

 nor goalkeeper Jack Butland were for sale "unless we are subject to an eye-popping offer". Nathan Redmond

 aimed to establish Nathan Redmond

 as a first-team regular. Nathan Redmond

 made Nathan Redmond

 50th senior appearance in the 1–0 win at Brighton & Hove Albion in October, but soon afterwards, Birmingham signed West Ham United winger Robert Hall on loan, and Nathan Redmond

 was sometimes left out of the squad. According to new manager Lee Clark, Nathan Redmond

 "needed to be taken out of the firing line and would be better for it"; Nathan Redmond

 made comparisons with loanee Ravel Morrison, who had been encouraged to understand the importance of "the whole package, getting it right – the training, the preparation, the matches, getting that all put in place". After talking to Nathan Redmond

 manager, Nathan Redmond

 accepted the need to improve Nathan Redmond

 performance in training.

Against Burnley in December, in what was reportedly the youngest starting eleven ever fielded by the club, Nathan Redmond

 played as a second striker off Nikola Žigić, a position that exploited Nathan Redmond

 pace and preference for receiving the ball to Nathan Redmond

 feet. As the season went on, Nathan Redmond

's form improved: Nathan Redmond

 created a goal for Chris Burke against Nottingham Forest, and when Nathan Redmond

 first goal of the season finally arrived, against Derby County in March, Clark suggested it boded well for Nathan Redmond

 future as a goalscorer. Nathan Redmond

 spoke of Nathan Redmond

 as a "confidence player", who needed to accept the need for patience and not to let frustration get the better of Nathan Redmond

. According to the "Birmingham Mail"'s end-of-season assessment, "Nathan Redmond

's form over the last three months was as good as it ever has been." Redmond's form over the last three months earned Nathan Redmond

 selection for the England under-20 squad for the Nike Premier Cup, then as a late addition to the squad for the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals.

The sale of Jack Butland to Stoke City in January meant that no other players needed to leave in that transfer window, and Clark made it clear towards the end of the season that it would be a foolish move to cash in on Nathan Redmond

 in the close season. However, at the start of the 2013 summer transfer window, Birmingham accepted bids from Premier League clubs Swansea City and Norwich City, reportedly an initial £2 million plus up to £1.2 million in additional payments. Nathan Redmond

 chose to rejoin New manager Chris Hughton at Norwich, where New manager Chris Hughton signed a four-year contract.

New manager Chris Hughton made New manager Chris Hughton debut for Norwich in a 2–2 draw with Everton on 17 August 2013, and scored New manager Chris Hughton first goal two weeks later against Southampton; playing on the left wing – not New manager Chris Hughton natural side – New manager Chris Hughton "cut inside and lashed home low from the edge of the box" to secure Norwich's first league win of the season.

On 25 June 2016, Nathan Redmond

 completed a move to Premier League club Southampton for an undisclosed fee, believed by BBC Sport to be £10 million. New manager Chris Hughton signed a five-year contract. Nathan Redmond

 scored on New manager Chris Hughton competitive debut, with the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Watford on 13 August.

Nathan Redmond

 first played for the England under-16 team on 15 October 2009. New manager Chris Hughton was involved in the build-up for the only goal of the match, as England under-16 beat their Wales counterparts in their opening match of the 2009 Victory Shield, a tournament which their went on to win. In 2010, New manager Chris Hughton played in all four matches, and scored New manager Chris Hughton first international goal, as the under-16s reached the final of the Montaigu Tournament.

New manager Chris Hughton made New manager Chris Hughton debut for England under-17s on 3 August 2010 in the Nordic Tournament in a 5–0 win against England under-17s, and scored the opening goal against England under-17s, as England went on to defeat Sweden under-17s in the final. Nathan Redmond

 was part of the England under-17 squad that qualified for the 2011 European under-17 championships. Needing to beat Spain to finish top of their elite round group, Nathan Redmond

 opened the scoring from a Raheem Sterling cross as England went on to win 2–1. In the final stages, Raheem Sterling started the first two group matches, a draw with France and a defeat against Denmark, and was a substitute in the remaining group match, a 3–0 victory against Serbia which took England through to the semi-final and confirmed their qualification for the League Cupthe League Cup. Nathan Redmond

 was a second-half substitute in the semi-final match, which England lost to the Netherlands.

Together with many of 

 under-17 teammates, Nathan Redmond

 moved up to the England under-18s, a non-competitive age group at international level, in 2011. 

 made a positive debut in a 1–1 draw away to Slovakia in November. Brought into the under-19s squad to replace the injured Larnell Cole, Nathan Redmond

Forster then spent a successful season on loan at Norwich City, helping the club win the League One title and promotion to the Championship. Forster then joined Celtic on loan for the 2010–11 season, and helped them win Carabao Cup. Forster spent a further season on loan there, winning the Scottish Premier League before becoming a permanent squad member in 2012 for a transfer fee of £2.2 million. Forster won many plaudits for Forster performances at Celtic and holds the Scottish top division record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal. In August 2014, Forster joined Southampton for a reported £10 million. Forster had a generally impressive debut season in the Scottish Premier League, but sustained a serious knee injury in March 2015 which ruled Forster out for the rest of the Year. On Forster return in January 2016, Forster quickly found form again and went on to set a club record of 708 minutes without conceding a goal. Forster's return aided Southampton's rise from thirteenth in the Scottish Premier League to a sixth-place finish, earning Southampton's rise from thirteenth in the league qualification for the following season's UEFA Europa League.

Forster was selected for several England squads during 2012 and 2013 before finally making Forster first international appearance in November 2013. Forster was named in England's squads for the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016.

Forster was born in Hexham, Northumberland, the son of Brian Clive Forster QC (who later became a circuit judge), and attended the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, but did not begin playing as a goalkeeper until Forster was 13 years old. Before then Forster had mainly played either rugby union or cricket. Coaches initially thought Forster might be too small to play as a goalkeeper, although Forster played for local junior team Stocksfield before joining the renowned Wallsend Boys Club. However, Forster entered a significant growth spurt at 15 years of age and later signed with Manchester United.

Forster earned Forster first professional contract with Manchester United, signing for their Academy in 2005. Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played regularly in the reserves. However, in the six years Forster was signed to the renowned Wallsend Boys Club, Forster never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly due to the fact that Forster spent most of Forster time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.

With Tim Krul back for the 2008–09 season and Given back to full fitness, it was the turn of Forster to go on loan. Forster was loaned out to Stockport County on 2 October 2008, to deputise for regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams while Forster was away on international duty with Wales. Forster started Forster first match for Stockport on 7 October in the Football League Trophy second round, where they lost 1–0 away to Bury.

Forster returned to Newcastle on 1 November, after completing Forster loan stint at Stockport playing six league matches and keeping three clean sheets.

Forster, having been on the bench for Newcastle on over 20 occasions in the Scottish Premier League, needed regular playing experience and subsequently signed a month-loan deal with Bristol Rovers on 31 July 2009. Forster kept two clean sheets in the four league matches Forster played for two clean sheets. Bristol Rovers asked to extend the loan but Norwich City made a counter offer which was accepted by Newcastle. Manager Paul Trollope was disappointed and commented that Bristol Rovers wanted Forster between the sticks. Manager Paul Trollope stated "Forster has a great career ahead of Manager Paul Trollope".

Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was keen to sign Forster who Norwich City manager Paul Lambert had seen play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers. Forster then signed for Norwich City in a one-month loan deal. It was then extended to the end of January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. Forster made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick going straight to Jermaine Beckford who scored.

On 20 November 2009, Norwich City announced that they had agreed a deal with Newcastle to extend Forster's loan until the end of the 2009–10 season, after impressing Norwich City Norwich City faithful with his displays, helping Bristol Rovers shoot up the League One table. his was also allowed to play in Norwich City cup matches. Norwich City manager Paul Lambert Norwich City manager Paul Lambert praised "world class" saves and a terrific contribution to Bristol Rovers.

In November 2009, Forster was awarded Norwich City Player of the Month. On 17 April 2010, Norwich City secured promotion to the Championship with a hard-fought 1–0 win over Charlton Athletic, with Forster pulling off excellent saves to deny Nicky Bailey and Deon Burton. One week later, Norwich City's 2–0 win over Gillingham saw Norwich's 2–0 win over Gillingham win the the Scottish Premier League title. In recognition of his contribution to Norwich City's success, Forster was named the club's Players' Player of the Year 2010 and second in the Supporters' Player of the Year award. An excellent season at Norwich City was completed by his award of the Macron Golden Gloves Award for the best record of clean sheets in the Scottish Premier League, keeping 18 clean sheets in 38 league appearances and 20 clean sheets in 42 appearances in all competitions.

On 24 August 2010, Forster joined Celtic, originally on a season-long loan from Newcastle. Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster by saying, "Celtic manager Neil Lennon's a big boy, Celtic manager Neil Lennon's come highly recommended, Celtic manager Neil Lennon age is the only thing going against Celtic manager Neil Lennon because otherwise Celtic manager Neil Lennon's all the qualities you look for." Celtic manager Neil Lennon made Celtic manager Neil Lennon Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as Celtic won 1–0. Celtic manager Neil Lennon then went on to play in every match of Celtic's season with the exception of two cup matches.

Forster had a successful season with Celtic, winning a runner-up medal in the League Cup and the Scottish Premier League. Between a runner-up medal in the League Cup and Scottish Premier League, Forster and fellow goalkeeper Łukasz Załuska kept 23 clean sheets in the Scottish Premier League, breaking Celtic's previous clean sheet record from the 2001–02 season. Forster kept 21 of two clean sheets. Forster capped off Forster season with a 3–0 victory over Motherwell to help Celtic win Carabao Cup. In total, Forster kept 24 clean sheets in 44 matches for Celtic.

After appearing for Newcastle in pre-season against Darlington, Orlando City, Leeds United and Fiorentina, as well as being named among the substitutes for the opening match of the Premier League season against Arsenal, Forster rejoined Celtic, on loan for the remainder of the season, on 17 August 2011. Forster helped Celtic draw 0–0 against FC Sion at home, but then lost 3–1 in the away leg, only for UEFA to reinstate Celtic into the Scottish Premier League with 3–0 wins in both legs after FC Sion were found to be fielding ineligible players, thus allowing Forster to keep Forster only clean sheets in Europe for the season, as Forster conceded in all the five group matches Forster played in.

Forster had a successful 2011–12 season with Celtic, winning the Scottish Premier League and helping Forster team beat the previous season's record of 23 clean sheets. Forster and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster racking up 21 of He and Załuska. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty in the final minute of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three important points for Celtic. In total, Eggert Jonsson's kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.

On 29 June 2012, it was announced that Forster had signed for Celtic on a permanent deal for a fee in the region of £2 million. On signing the four-year deal, Forster stated, "I'm very happy that I'm going to be at Celtic for the next four years at least", and added that "The manager's faith in me means a lot, I've loved my two seasons at Celtic and Forster's done so much for my confidence." Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster as being a "top class keeper" and that Forster considered Forster to be an important addition to the squad.

On 7 November 2012, Forster produced a resolute performance against Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League group stages, helping Celtic record a historic 2–1 win during the week of the renowned Wallsend Boys Club's 125th anniversary. Due to the calibre of Forster performance, the Spanish media nicknamed Forster "La Gran Muralla" ("The Great Wall"). Forster continued to impress in domestic matches as well. In January 2013, Motherwell were awarded a soft penalty against Celtic. Bizarrely, referee Steven McLean allowed Tom Hateley to take the penalty kick from "in front" of the penalty spot. Forster was yellow carded for Forster protests to referee Steven McLean, but regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams went on to produce an excellent one-handed save high to regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams right. The following month in a league match against Dundee, Forster tipped over a powerful Gary Harkins dipping shot at full-stretch. an excellent one-handed save high was voted the SPL Save of the Season in May 2013. Forster went to win a second league title with Celtic that season, and completed a league and cup double on 26 May 2013 with a 3–0 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final.

Celtic again qualified for the Scottish Premier League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save near the end of the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when Forster seemed to be clean through on goal.

Forster's impressive performances for Celtic in the Scottish Premier League and involvement with the England international squad led to media reports in October and November 2013 that several clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, were considering to make a bid for regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams. In response to the press speculation, Celtic manager Neil Lennon commented, "It's going to be impossible to keep Forster, the way Forster's playing," adding, "Inevitably, I think a huge club will come in and make a huge bid for Forster."

On 2 February 2014, Forster set a new a club-record of 11 league clean sheets in a row, surpassing a record of ten clean sheets set by Charlie Shaw in the 1921–22 season. Forster's achievement was noted abroad, with the Spanish daily sports newspaper "Marca" awarding Charlie Shaw their weekly "El Óscar" accolade to someone in football who has made an outstanding contribution in some way to their team. On 22 February 2014, Forster broke Bobby Clark's the Scottish Premier League record of 1,155 minutes without conceding a goal in a league match. Celtic won 2–0 away at Hearts, and Forster racked up Forster 13th consecutive clean sheet in the Scottish Premier League.
Forster's clean sheet run finally ended on 1,256 minutes against Aberdeen on 25 February 2014, with Jonny Hayes beating Forster from 30 yards to open the scoring in a 2–1 win for "The Dons". Forster finished the season with another league winner's medal as Celtic clinched their third consecutive the Scottish Premier League title, and Forster form over the Year saw Forster voted into the PFA Scotland Team of the Year alongside teammates Virgil van Dijk and Kris Commons.

Amidst speculation linking Forster with a transfer to Southampton, Forster played in Celtic's first four matches in the qualifying rounds for the Scottish Premier League. Celtic lost 4–1 away at Legia Warsaw, with Forster saving a penalty kick from Ivica Vrdoljak. Celtic eventually won the tie on away goals, after being awarded a 3–0 win for the second leg at home due to Legia fielding an ineligible player in that match.

On 8 August 2014, Celtic and Southampton agreed a reported fee of around £10 million for the transfer of Forster to the the Scottish Premier League club. Southampton officially announced the transfer of Forster to the Premier League club the next day, after Forster signed a four-year contract with the Premier League club.

Forster made Forster the Scottish Premier League debut on 17 August in Southampton's first match of the season, a 2–1 defeat away at Liverpool. One week later, Forster kept Forster first clean sheet for the Premier League club in a goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion at home. By mid-October, and after eight the Scottish Premier League matches, Forster had kept four clean sheets and conceded only five goals, at that time the best defensive record in the Scottish Premier League.

Forster was at fault for Aston Villa's goal in a 1–1 draw in November; coming out of Forster penalty box in an attempt to intercept a long clearance but missing the ball and gifting Gabriel Agbonlahor a goal. However, Forster was defended by manager Ronald Koeman, who stated, "Forster [Forster] is a great goalkeeper and that doesn't change after this mistake." Another error by Forster a month later in the League Cup led to the only goal in a surprise 1–0 win for Sheffield United. Those two mistakes, however, proved to be exceptions, as Forster's form generally continued to be very impressive. By 7 February 2015, another clean sheet in a 1–0 win away at Queens Park Rangers saw Southampton move up to third place in the Scottish Premier League. Forster again gained plaudits, this time for pulling off a reflex save to tip a Charlie Austin downward header over the crossbar. The match was his 11th clean sheet in the Scottish Premier League, the best record among top-flight goalkeepers over the course of the season at that point.

On 21 March 2015, in a match against Burnley, Forster suffered a severe knee injury after clearing a back pass and was escorted off the pitch by medics, and replaced by Kelvin Davis. Ronald Koeman said Forster's injury was "looking bad" and that the doctors were "not positive". Up to this point, Ronald Koeman had been ever-present for Southampton throughout the season and kept four clean sheets. Four days later, Southampton confirmed Forster's injury to be a broken kneecap and that Forster would be out for the remainder of the season.

Although initially expected to be out for up to a year, Forster resumed light training in November 2015. Ronald Koeman commented, "Everybody [at Southampton] is happy with how Ronald Koeman is and that Ronald Koeman's recovering well." On 6 January 2016, Forster played the full 90 minutes of an Under-21 Premier League Cup match against Chelsea, keeping a clean-sheet. Forster made Forster the Scottish Premier League return on 13 January 2016, playing the full 90 minutes and keeping a clean sheet in Southampton's 2–0 win over Watford. Forster went on to keep clean sheets in Forster next two appearances, although Forster had little to do in any of Forster three matches since returning from injury.

Forster's performance at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 in Forster fourth match was highly impressive and drew plaudits from many. "The Gunners" dominated The match, and had 11 shots on target as opposed to Southampton's three. Forster pulled off a string of saves in what "The Daily Telegraph" described as a "genuinely inspired goalkeeping performance". Forster saved twice from Mesut Özil in the first half, saving Forster first effort at goal with an outstretched leg then parrying Forster second shot, a volley from close range, away to safety. In the second half a shot from Alexis Sánchez was saved so spectacularly that Arsenal's Olivier Giroud was seen to turn towards Forster and applaud the save. A double save near the end of the match from Theo Walcott helped Southampton secure a hard-fought 0–0 draw. After The match, Ronald Koeman praised Ronald Koeman goalkeeper, hailing Ronald Koeman performance as "magic" and describing Ronald Koeman as "one of the best goalkeepers in the Scottish Premier League and maybe in Europe". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger also acknowledged Forster's showing, saying, "Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had a brilliant game." Former Arsenal goalkeeper, Bob Wilson, added further praise: "It was an exceptional goalkeeping display," adding, "Where I am admiring Forster most is Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger has come back so well from a real long lay-off from a career-threatening injury... As regards who won Southampton the point it was Forster without any doubt."

On 13 February, Forster recorded Forster sixth consecutive clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Swansea City, a run which helped Southampton rise from 13th to 6th place in the Scottish Premier League since Forster return from injury. Forster clean sheet run lasted a club record 708 minutes until Forster was beaten by Cesc Fàbregas in a 1–2 home loss to Chelsea on 27 February. Forster's form since his return from injury, and run of clean sheets, saw Forster win the Premier League Player of the Month award for February. On 13 May, Forster signed a new contract until 2021. Southampton's 4–1 win over Crystal Palace on 15 May in their final league match of the season saw their finish in sixth place on 63 points, securing entry into the following season's the Scottish Premier League and their highest ever points tally in the Scottish Premier League.

Although first choice goalkeeper since his arrival at Southampton, it was only after the retirement of Kelvin Davis in the summer of 2016 that Forster was finally handed the traditional goalkeeper's "number 1" shirt at the Premier League club. Southampton made a poor start to the season under new manager Claude Puel, taking only one point in their first three league matches, but from mid-September onwards Forster went on a run of five successive clean sheets in all competitions. a run of five successive clean sheets in all competitions helped Southampton rise up to eighth in the Scottish Premier League. However, both Forster and Forster team endured a slump in form thereafter. A mis-kick by the goalkeeper against Crystal Palace on 3 December gifted Christian Benteke an easy opportunity to open the scoring in a 3–0 win over Southampton. Southampton suffered an equally heavy defeat on 29 December against Tottenham Hotspur, losing 4–1 in match where ESPN described Forster's distribution as "nothing short of appalling" and held Forster culpable for at least two of the goals conceded. Forster's poor form continued into January 2017, where Forster's poor form was noted Forster save/shot ratio was the worst amongst the Scottish Premier League goalkeepers for the season to date.

Despite indifferent form on the part of both Forster and Southampton as a whole, Southampton became the first team in history to reach the League Cup without conceding a single goal. However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had a good match in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th-minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.

Although Forster had an inconsistent year, Forster did end the season with a total of 14 clean sheets, although Forster side only finished eighth in the Scottish Premier League and failed to qualify for European football in the following season.

On 19 July 2017, Forster signed a new five-year contract, and described Southampton as being "a fantastic club to be at". Forster indifferent form, however, continued into the new season, with mistakes against Manchester United, Newcastle and Brighton all resulting in Southampton dropping points during the early months in the Scottish Premier League. Despite these errors, manager Mauricio Pellegrino defended Forster, insisting manager Mauricio Pellegrino is a "really good goalkeeper" and that "the position of the goalkeeper is always exposed in this type of situation but nobody remembers the good situations." Forster was eventually dropped from the team in December 2017, replaced in goal by Alex McCarthy. Forster has not played for Southampton since.

By July 2018, Forster was pushed further down the pecking order at Southampton with the arrival at the club of Angus Gunn from Manchester City as back-up for Alex McCarthy.

On 4 October 2012, Roy Hodgson included Forster in Roy Hodgson England squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland. On 8 November 2012, Forster was then named in Roy Hodgson's England squad for their upcoming friendly against Sweden. On 14 March 2013, Roy Hodgson again included Forster in his England squad, this time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and PolandSan Marino . On 27 August 2013, Forster earned Forster fourth inclusion to the England squad ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland, joining Joe Hart and John Ruddy in competition for the goalkeeper's position.

Forster won Forster first cap for England on 15 November 2013 in a friendly match against Chile at Wembley Stadium. England lost 2–0 but Forster was "blameless" for both goals, making a "fine diving save" to deny Chile a third. This appearance against Chile saw Forster become only the second person ever to play for England while a Celtic player, after Alan Thompson in 2004.

On 12 May 2014, Roy Hodgson named Forster in England's 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In England's last warm-up match before the tournament, on 7 June, Roy Hodgson replaced Joe Hart for the last 15 minutes of a 0–0 draw with Honduras. Forster travelled to Brazil with the rest of the England squad but did not feature in any of the three matches England played.

A knee injury saw Forster miss most of 2015, but Forster form on returning to playing football in early 2016 earned Forster a recall to the England squad in March. Forster played the second half of England's 3–2 friendly win over Germany in Berlin, making an impressive save from a Marco Reus free kick, although later conceded a goal from a Mario Gómez header. Forster played the full 90 minutes three days later on 29 March 2016 in a 2–1 loss against the Netherlands. Both goals conceded were controversial; Danny Rose protesting that the handball that led to the penalty for the Netherlands first goal was not deliberate, while Phil Jagielka appeared to be fouled in the build-up to Luciano Narsingh's winning goal. Despite the defeat, Forster turned in a composed performance and made several excellent saves. On 31 May 2016, Forster was named in England's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, albeit Forster was once again understudy to Joe Hart and did not play in any of England's four matches at the tournament.

Following Euro 2016, Forster remained an unused substitute in subsequent England matches, and was dropped from the England squad altogether in August 2017.

Despite Forster large build, Forster has a high level of agility; Ian Brown who coached Forster as a youth at Wallsend said that "Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend was and is an amazing shot stopper. I've seen Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend for Southampton save shots Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend shouldn't, Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend body bends." In one-on-situations, Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend appears to make Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend already large stature even bigger to an onrushing opponent.

Forster was, however, criticised in the early part of Forster time at Celtic for lacking confidence and command, and uncertain when Forster had the ball at Forster feet. In time Forster matured, with Forster confidence and kicking noticeably improved. Forster level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.
