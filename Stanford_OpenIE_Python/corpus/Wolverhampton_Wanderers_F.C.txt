Ivan Cavaleiro

Ivan Ricardo Neves Abreu Cavaleiro (born 18 October 1993) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for English club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Mainly a winger, he can also play as a forward.

A product of Benfica's youth system, he was part of the club's domestic treble in the 2013–14 season.

Cavaleiro earned 63 caps for Portugal at youth level all categories comprised, scoring 13 goals. He made his senior international debut in 2014.

Born in Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon District, Cavaleiro played youth football for five clubs, notably representing S.L. Benfica from ages 13–18, a loan spell notwithstanding. He made his senior debut in the 2012–13 season, playing his first Segunda Liga match with the reserves on 11 August 2012 against S.C. Braga B. The following weekend he scored his first goal(s) as a professional, grabbing a brace in a 4–2 away win over C.D. Feirense, and added another two before the end of the month, in a 6–0 home routing of C.F. Os Belenenses; he finished his first year with 38 appearances and 12 goals, helping his team to the seventh position.

Cavaleiro started his second season with Benfica B in fashion, netting seven times in ten matches and earning the "Second Division Player of the Month" award for August/September. He made his official debut for the main squad on 19 October 2013, playing the full 90 minutes against CD Cinfães for the Taça de Portugal and assisting Ola John for the game's only goal; only four days later, he appeared in his maiden match in the UEFA Champions League, playing the second half of a 1–1 home draw against Olympiacos F.C. for the group stage.

On 15 January 2014, Cavaleiro scored his first competitive goal for Benfica, netting the last in a 2–0 win against Leixões S.C. for the campaign's Taça da Liga. On 7 August, he was loaned to Deportivo de La Coruña in the Spanish La Liga for one year, making his debut on the first matchday and opening the scoring in a 1–2 defeat at Granada CF.

On 10 July 2015, Cavaleiro joined AS Monaco FC on a permanent deal until 2020, for a transfer fee rumoured to be €15 million. He made his debut on the 28th, starting in a 3–1 away win over BSC Young Boys in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, and scored his first goal in the second leg, opening a 4–0 victory at the Stade Louis II.

On 31 August 2016, Cavaleiro moved to English Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers on a five-year deal (with the option of an additional year) for an undisclosed fee, reported to be a new club-record sum of £7 million. He made his debut on 10 September in a 1–1 home draw to Burton Albion, and scored his first goal for the club 14 days later in a 3–1 win against Brentford also at Molineux Stadium.

Cavaleiro was voted the Professional Footballers' Association Fans' Championship Player of the Month for November 2017, after netting four times in as many games. The previous month, he had provided five assists to keep his team clear at the top of the table; he finished the season with nine goals from 42 appearances (adding 12 decisive passes), and achieved promotion to the Premier League as champion.

Cavaleiro's first match in the English top division occurred on 29 September 2018, and he scored once in the 2–0 home victory over Southampton with his very first touch of the ball after coming on as a substitute in place of compatriot Diogo Jota.

Cavaleiro was named in the Portugal under-19 squad at the 2012 UEFA European Championship, playing the last match of the group stage against Greece. A year later, he represented the under-20 team at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup: he appeared in four games as a substitute in Turkey, in an eventual round-of-16 exit.

Cavaleiro made his debut for the under-21s on 14 August 2013, netting a hat-trick in a 5–2 friendly win against Switzerland. On 27 June 2015, he scored Portugal's third goal in a 5–0 win against Germany in the semi-finals of the European Championship in Czech Republic; he was named in the Team of the Tournament, in an eventual runner-up finish.

On 28 February 2014, Cavaleiro received his first callup for the Portugal senior side, for an exhibition game with Cameroon on 5 March, starting and playing 70 minutes in the 5–1 win in Leiria.

Cavaleiro's father, Lindo, was crowned Angolan youth champion for Atlético Petróleos de Luanda, whilst his uncle Monhé excelled as a midfielder for Progresso Associação do Sambizanga.

Rúben Neves

Rúben Diogo da Silva Neves (; born 13 March 1997) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Portugal national team.

Born in Mozelos (Santa Maria da Feira), Aveiro District, Neves grew up supporting FC Porto and joined the club's youth system at the age of 8. During his time with the academy, he also spent a season on loan at Padroense which acted as the under-16 side; on his time in the youth structures, reserve team manager Luís Castro described him as a player with "extraordinary mental qualities, to go along with technical and tactical skills".

Ahead of the 2014–15 campaign, Neves was earmarked to bypass Porto's under-19s and play with the reserves instead. Following an injury to teammate Mikel Agu, however, he was called by Julen Lopetegui to be part of the main squad's pre-season preparations. On 15 August 2014, aged 17 years and five months, he made his Primeira Liga debut where he started and scored in a 2–0 home win against Marítimo – in doing so, he became the youngest player in the club's history to score a goal in the competition. He played his first match in the UEFA Champions League five days later in a 1–0 win over Lille, and broke another record (previously held by Cristiano Ronaldo) by being the youngest Portuguese to appear in the tournament.

On 10 December 2014, during a Champions League group stage fixture against Shakhtar Donetsk, Neves suffered an injury to his right knee following a collision in midfield with Alex Teixeira. At the end of the game, the club explained that he suffered a sprain, with apparent damage to the internal lateral ligament. After spending nearly a month on the sidelines, he returned to the pitch in a 3–1 home win over União da Madeira in the Taça da Liga; following his injury, his role in midfield was filled by Casemiro and he spent the majority of the remainder of the season behind the Brazilian in the pecking order.

On 20 October 2015, aged 18 years and 221 days, Neves became the youngest player to start as captain in the Champions League, helping Porto to a 2–0 win against Maccabi Tel Aviv in the group phase and surpassing previous record holder Rafael van der Vaart, who held it since 16 September 2003. On 5 December, in a 2–1 success over Paços de Ferreira also at the Estádio do Dragão, he broke another record by becoming the youngest player to achieve 50 games for the club, surpassing players like Fernando Gomes and Jaime Magalhães.

Neves scored his second competitive goal on 3 February 2016, opening the scoreline in a 3–0 triumph at Gil Vicente for the semi-finals of the Taça de Portugal.

On 8 July 2017, EFL Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers announced that they had signed Neves for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £15.8 million – a club and league record fee. Upon joining, he was reunited with former Porto manager Nuno Espírito Santo. He scored his first goal on 15 August, in a 3–2 away win over Hull City.

In April 2018, Neves was nominated for the EFL Championship Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards, and was also included in the Team of the Season along with teammates Conor Coady and John Ruddy. His team was ultimately promoted as champions with the player scoring six goals in 42 appearances, all of which were scored from outside of the box; at the conclusion of the campaign, he claimed a hat-trick of club awards as he walked away with the Player of the Season, Player's Player of the Season and Goal of the Season accolades.

Wolves announced that Neves had signed a new contract in July 2018, extending until 2023. In the first match of the new season, he scored his first Premier League goal and assisted Raúl Jiménez in the latter's competitive debut, as his team twice came from behind to draw 2–2 against Everton. His appearance in the match, alongside compatriots Rui Patrício, João Moutinho, Diogo Jota and Hélder Costa also saw the club break the league record for the most Portuguese players named in a starting line-up.

On 6 October 2018, Neves made his 50th appearance for Wolverhampton and marked the occasion by contributing in the build-up for Matt Doherty's winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Crystal Palace. The following January, his 55th-minute winning goal against Liverpool at Molineux in the FA Cup, "a venomous dipping shot from that beat Simon Mignolet at his near post", was voted the best of the third round by visitors to BBC Sport's website.

Neves represented Portugal at the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, helping the country reach the semi-finals as team captain. For his performances, he was named among the top ten talents of the tournament by a selection of UEFA reporters.

On 29 August 2014, still aged 17, Neves was called by coach Rui Jorge to be part of the under-21 side. He scored his first goal on 14 October, helping to a 5–4 home win against the Netherlands for the playoff round of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

When the finals began in the Czech Republic, Neves broke a new record by becoming the youngest player to debut for the Portuguese under-21s in the tournament, aged 18 years and three months, playing five minutes to help beat England 1–0 in the group stage opener. It was his only appearance, as the country reached the final and lost it to Sweden in a penalty shootout.

Neves was first called up to the senior squad on 10 November 2015, ahead of friendlies against Russia and Luxembourg as an injury replacement for João Moutinho. He made his debut in the former match, featuring 17 minutes in the 0–1 loss in Krasnodar, then played the entire 2–0 win against the latter at the Stade Josy Barthel, sharing the midfield area with Porto teammates Danilo Pereira and André André.

Neves was selected by full side manager Fernando Santos to a preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but he did not make the final cut.

An article on UEFA.com described Neves as a defensive midfielder who is not afraid to go forward and prompt attacks, showing great maturity combined with an accurate passing skill, great vision and an astute sense of positioning. His playing attributes also granted him comparisons to Portuguese international teammate Moutinho for his fine first touch, similar desire to press his opponents and excellent distribution.

Neves also drew praise in the media for his technical, tactical and mental qualities, as well as his intelligence and shooting ability.

Raúl Jiménez

Raúl Alonso Jiménez Rodríguez (; born 5 May 1991) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a forward for English club Wolverhampton Wanderers, on loan from Benfica, and the Mexico national team.

He began his career in Club América's youth system before debuting in the first division in October 2011. He won his first championship with América in 2013, winning the Clausura tournament, and was the team's second-highest goalscorer. In August 2014, Jiménez was sold to Spanish club Atlético Madrid, who were the reigning league champions. After one season he was sold to Benfica, with whom he won two consecutive league titles, among other major honours.

Jiménez was a part of the Mexican squad that won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in 2012. A full international since 2013, Jiménez has represented his country at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 2013 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2015 Copa América, and the Copa América Centenario.

Jiménez began his career playing for Club América's youth system, being considered a promising young striker. On 9 October 2011, under interim-coach Alfredo Tena, Jiménez made his professional debut during the Apertura tournament against Monarcas Morelia, in a match which ended in a 1–1 draw. He scored his first goal on 30 October in a 2–3 loss to Puebla, scoring in the 2nd minute of the match. He appeared six times and scored one goal in his debut tournament.

Jiménez did not appear in the Clausura 2012 until 11 February—week seven of the tournament—against Atlas, which ended in a 1–1 draw, coming on as a second-half substitute for Christian Bermúdez. He scored his first goal of the tournament on 9 March in the 1–1 draw against Tijuana at the Estadio Caliente. Jiménez appeared twelve times and scored once during the Clausura, with América being eliminated in the semi-finals by Monterrey.

After participating in the Summer Olympics with Mexico and the sale of Vicente Matías Vuoso, Jiménez won a spot in América's starting eleven for the Apertura 2012 tournament, playing as a second-striker alongside Christian Benítez in manager Miguel Herrera's 5-3-2 tactical scheme. He was also given the vacant number 9 shirt, switching from the number 47 shirt he debuted with. Jiménez scored on 15 September in the 2–0 victory over Santos Laguna at the Estadio Azteca. He would go on to score two weeks later in the 1–1 draw against Monarcas Morelia. Jiménez received his first red card during América's 2–1 victory over San Luis, meaning he would miss "El Súper Clásico" against Guadalajara. On 3 November, he scored the second goal in the 4–0 win over Pachuca. On 17 November, Jiménez scored in the 1–2 defeat to Morelia in the second-leg of the quarter-final. Despite the loss, América won the series by a 3–2 aggregate score and advanced to the semi-finals. América would ultimately be eliminated in the semi-finals by Toluca. Jimenéz ended the tournament with sixteen appearances and scoring four goals.

Jiménez began the Clausura 2013 tournament as a starter in the first two league matches, and scored his first brace in the 4–0 victory over Atlante on 19 January. He bagged another brace on 2 February in América's 3–0 win against Querétaro. On 31 March, Jiménez scored two headers in the 2–0 victory over Guadalajara at the Estadio Omnilife. Jimenéz finished the regular phase of the tournament with eight goals, and scored in América's 1–0 away win over Pumas UNAM in the first-leg of the quarter-final series of the playoffs on 8 May. In the second-leg of the semi-final series against Monterrey, Jimenéz scored from a penalty and assisted Christian Benitez in the second goal to win the match 2–1 (4–3 on aggregate), sending América to the Final against Cruz Azul. Jiménez played in both legs and scored in the subsequent penalty shoot-out which América ultimately won, thus being crowned league champions.

On 3 August 2013 Jiménez scored his first goal of the Apertura tournament in the 3–0 win over Atlas. He would go on to score in the following three-consecutive matches in wins over Atlante, Pachuca, and Morelia, respectively, taking his goal tally to four goals in five matches played. He would score again on 13 September in América's 1–2 defeat to Santos Laguna. On 5 October, Jiménez scored a header and assisted in Luis Gabriel Rey's goal in the 2–0 victory over Guadalajara. Jiménez ended the regular-phase of the Apertura with seven goals in twelve games played. He scored in the second-leg of the quarter-finals against Tigres UANL which ended in a 1–1 draw at the Estadio Azteca on 1 December, with América advancing, despite a 2–2 aggregate score, due to the away-goals rule. América would win the semi-final matches against Toluca and advance once again to the league final, though failing to achieve the repeat after losing both legs to León.

The Clausura 2014 tournament saw Jiménez make 17 appearances and score 8 goals. In the quarter-final match against Santos Laguna on 30 April, Jiménez scored a hat-trick in the 5–3 win. However, América would lose the second-leg of the series 1–3 and being eliminated from the playoffs, despite a 6–6 aggregate score due to the away-goals rule.

Jiménez began the Apertura 2014 tournament scoring four goals in the first three games. On 26 July, he scored the first goal in América's 2–1 win over Tijuana. On 4 August, he scored a hat-trick and assisted Oribe Peralta in the 4–0 win against Puebla. Jiménez played his final game for América on 9 August 2014 against Tigres UANL, providing the assist for the second goal scored by Miguel Layún in the 2–0 win.

On 13 August 2014, Atlético Madrid reached an agreement with Club América for Jiménez, for a fee reported to be in the region of €11 million. The following day, he signed a six-year deal after passing the medical examination. Jiménez made his debut on 16 August, in the final of the Ramón de Carranza Trophy pre-season tournament against Sampdoria, starting the match and being substituted out in the 79th minute. Atlético won 2–0.

Jiménez made his competitive debut in the first leg of the Supercopa de España on 19 August, a 1–1 draw against Real Madrid, playing the final 12 minutes in place of fellow debutant Mario Mandžukić. Jiménez played in the second leg as well coming in as a substitute for Antoine Griezmann in the 73rd minute of the match, the game ended in a 1–0 win and an aggregated score of 2–1.

Jiménez made his La Liga debut on 25 August 2014, in a goalless draw against Rayo Vallecano. He scored his first league goal for Atlético on 27 September, in a 4–0 win against Sevilla, coming off the bench. It was his only goal for Atlético that season.

On 9 August 2015 Jiménez, who was expected to complete a loan deal to Premier League side West Ham, failed to show up to his medical after reports claimed he had missed his flight to London after he had overslept. However, multiple sources had reported his agent Jorge Mendes had suggested he spurn the move, in favour of a move to Primeira Liga side Benfica.

On 13 August 2015, Jiménez joined Portuguese champions Benfica, signing a five-year deal. Benfica spent €9.836 million to bring Jiménez to the club, although this included unspecified amounts on agent's fees and signing-on fees in addition to the transfer fee itself. The €9.836 million may have included a €1 million transfer fee, and €3 million to acquire 50% of the player's economic rights.

Jiménez scored his first goal for Benfica on 29 August against Moreirense, scoring a header in the 75th minute to level the score 1–1, with Benfica eventually winning the match 3–2.

On 26 November, Jiménez scored his first two goals in the UEFA Champions League, striking at both ends in each half as Benfica salvaged a 2–2 away draw against Astana. On 9 March 2016, he helped Benfica to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a 2–1 away victory against Zenit Saint Petersburg. In the 85th minute of the match, Jimenéz struck a long-range shot which was saved by Yuri Lodygin onto the bar, with the ball rebounding to Nicolás Gaitán who tied the match 1–1. On 9 April, he came off the bench and scored the winning goal in the 2–1 victory against Académica, securing Benfica's lead in the Primeira Liga. Four days later, due to the suspension of Jonas in the first leg, Jiménez started the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final match against Bayern Munich, scoring the first goal in the 2–2 draw at the Estádio da Luz; a 3–2 defeat on aggregate meant Benfica were eliminated from the competition.

On 24 April, he scored another winner in the league, this time scoring the lone goal against Rio Ave, extending Benfica's lead in the league. On 15 May, Jiménez came on as a second-half substitute as Benfica were crowned league champions after defeating Nacional 4–1. Five days later, he capped off the season scoring from the penalty spot in the 6–2 win over Marítimo in the Taça da Liga final, where he also finished as the competition's top goalscorer with four goals.

On 21 July 2016, it was announced that Benfica had purchased the remaining 50% of Jiménez's economic rights for €12 million. It was widely reported that this had brought the total value of his transfer to around €22 million, making Jiménez the most expensive player in Portuguese football history, and the most expensive Mexican player. In that season, he played in the Taça de Portugal final, which Benfica won over Vitória de Guimarães (2–1).

Jiménez came off the bench to score Benfica's third goal in their 3–1 Supertaça de Oliveira victory over Vitória de Guimarães. On 17 December, Jiménez made his 100th appearance for Benfica in all competitions following an away 5–1 win over Tondela.

On 12 June 2018, Benfica loaned out Jiménez to newly-promoted Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers on a season-long loan for a fee of €3 million with a buyout clause of €38 million. On 29 June, it was reported that he had extended his contract with Benfica until June 2021 before being loaned out.

Jiménez made his unofficial debut with the team on 22 July in a semifinal match against VfL Bochum in the H-Hotels Cup, where he failed to convert a penalty, the first following his perfect conversion rate. On 11 August, Jiménez marked his competitive debut for Wolves by scoring the equalizing goal that earned the home team a 2–2 draw with visiting Everton on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. On 16 September, Jiménez scored the only goal in the victory over Burnley. On 22 September, he provided an assist to João Moutinho to tie the match 1–1 against Manchester United in the league. On 29 September, he provided an assist to Ivan Cavaleiro to score the first goal in a 2–0 victory over Southampton. On 6 October, Jiménez provided the assist for Matt Doherty's goal in his team's 1–0 away victory over Crystal Palace; it was his third assist of the season, meaning Jiménez was involved in a goal in each of the previous four league games for Wolves, assisting in the past three after scoring in the game prior to that. On 11 November, he provided the assist to Ivan Cavaleiro in the 1–1 draw against Arsenal, taking his season assist tally to four. Jiménez scored Wolves' first goal in a 2–1 win against Chelsea at Molineux on 5 December. Jiménez scored the first goal in Wolves's 2–0 win over Bournemouth on 15 December. This was the first time Wolves had won three consecutive Premier League games and the first time Wolves had won three in a row in the top flight of English football since 1980.

On 10 March 2019, Jiménez, with his goal for Wolves in their 1–1 draw against Chelsea, tied Steven Fletcher as the Wolves player with the most Premier League goals scored in a single season with twelve. Six days later, Jiménez scored the first goal for Wolverhampton in a 2–1 home victory over Manchester United to advance to the semi-final of the FA Cup; it was his third goal in the cup, and fifteen of the season in all competitions.

In 2012, Jiménez was selected by coach Luis Fernando Tena to participate in the 2012 Toulon Tournament with the under-23 national team. Jiménez managed to score Mexico's third goal in the 4–2 victory over the Netherlands in the semi-finals on 30 May. Mexico would subsequently win the final, defeating Turkey 3–0.

Jiménez made the final cut in the squad participating in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He made his Olympic debut in the group stage match against South Korea on 26 July, which ended in a 0–0 draw, with Jiménez coming in as a substitute and coming close to scoring a late goal, with the ball ricocheting off the goalkeeper's left-hand post. He subsequently made appearances against Switzerland, Senegal, Japan, and Brazil in the final, coming on as a substitute in those matches. Mexico would go on to defeat Brazil 2–1 and win the gold medal.

Jiménez made his debut for the senior national team in a 1–1 draw against Denmark on 30 January 2013, coming on as a second-half substitute.

On 20 May 2013, Jiménez was named in the 23-man squad participating in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup held in Brazil, and featured in all three group games for a combined 96 minutes. On 22 June, he was named in the starting eleven for the third match against Japan, being substituted off in the 90th minute for Javier Aquino in Mexico's 2–0 victory.

On 26 June 2013, it was announced that Jiménez was included in Mexico's 23-man squad for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, replacing midfielder David Cabrera due to injury. He was a starter and played in every group stage match, managing to score against Canada in Mexico's 2–0 win on 11 July. On 20 July, Jiménez scored the only goal in the quarterfinal victory over Trinidad and Tobago. Mexico would be eliminated by Panama in the semifinal.

During the World Cup qualifier match against Panama on 11 October 2013, in which Mexico needed a victory to not complicate the qualification process, Jiménez would go on to score a bicycle kick goal that led to Mexico's 2–1 victory.

In their next match against Ecuador on 19 June, he scored from the penalty spot after Gabriel Achilier brought down Hugo Ayala, but the 1–2 defeat saw Mexico eliminated in last place in their group.

Jiménez scored his only goal in the tournament against New Zealand to tie the game 1–1; the team would go on winning the match 2–1.

Rui Patrício

Rui Pedro dos Santos Patrício (; born 15 February 1988) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Portugal national team.

Before moving to England, he spent most of his career with Sporting CP, making his debut with the first team at only 18 and going on to appear in 467 official games. He won five trophies during his 12-year spell there, including two Portuguese Cups.

Patrício earned his first cap for Portugal in 2010, after Paulo Bento's appointment as head coach. He represented the nation in two World Cups and three European Championships, winning the 2016 edition of the latter tournament.

Born in Marrazes, Leiria, Patrício played as a striker at a young age. Reportedly, a Sporting CP scout was in the area and saw him play in goal, being impressed enough to sign the 12-year-old to the club's youth academy. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 19 November 2006, in a 1–0 away win against C.S. Marítimo in the tenth round: standing in for habitual club and country first-choice Ricardo, he saved a penalty kick 15 minutes before the end of the game.

In the 2007–08 season, after Ricardo's departure to Real Betis, Patrício beat competition from Sporting veteran Tiago and new signing Vladimir Stojković to become the undisputed starter. He made his UEFA Champions League debut on 27 November 2007, in a 1–2 group stage loss at Manchester United.

During the 2008 off-season, Patrício was the subject of a rumored transfer to Italian giants Inter Milan. Nothing came of it, however, and in that year's Portuguese Supercup final, against FC Porto, he stopped a Lucho González penalty in a 2–0 final success, also being an everpresent fixture in the league.

In the qualifying rounds of the 2009–10 Champions League, at FC Twente, Sporting were trailing 0–1 in the 94th minute, after a 0–0 tie in the first leg: Patrício rushed to the opposing area for a corner kick, where he went up for a header with Nikita Rukavytsya. Both players seemed to make contact with the ball, and it was helped into the net for an own goal via the boot of Peter Wisgerhof as the latter side eventually qualified for the last games prior to the group stage.

On 20 December 2012, Patrício was awarded Sporting's Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive year. On 18 October 2014, with the score at 2–1 for his team, he saved a penalty by Jackson Martínez to help oust Porto from the Portuguese Cup with a 3–1 win at the "Estádio do Dragão".

On 24 October 2016, Patrício was one of 30 players nominated for the 2016 Ballon d'Or award alongside Portugal teammates Pepe and Cristiano Ronaldo. The following 18 February he appeared in his 400th competitive game with Sporting, putting on a Man of the match performance in a 1–0 home win against Rio Ave FC.

On 15 May 2018, Patrício and several of his teammates, including coaches, were injured following an attack by around 50 supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground after the team finished third in the league and missed out on Champions League qualification. Despite the events, he and the rest of the team agreed to play in the Portuguese Cup final scheduled for the following weekend, eventually losing to C.D. Aves.

On 1 June 2018, Patrício submitted a request to terminate his Sporting contract with grounds for just cause, due to the dressing room violence from supporters as well as seeing an €18 million move to newly promoted Premier League team Wolverhampton Wanderers fall through, after Sporting president Bruno de Carvalho pulled out of negotiations at the last minute. He completed the move on 18 June, on a four-year deal, and it was announced on 31 October that both clubs had agreed a €18 million deal as settlement of his departure to England.

Patrício opted to wear the No.11 shirt for Wolves as opposed to the habitual No.1, in honour of Carl Ikeme, who had just retired following treatment for acute leukaemia. He made his league debut on 11 August 2018, in a 2–2 home draw against Everton.

From 2007, Patrício started appearing for the Portuguese under-21 side. On 29 January of the following year, senior team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari called him up for a 1–3 friendly defeat against Italy in Zürich, although he did not leave the bench; on 12 May he was picked to the squad for UEFA Euro 2008, but did not play in the tournament.

Although not part of the provisional 24-player list for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Patrício was named in a backup list of six players. He made his debut on 17 November 2010, playing the second half of a 4–0 friendly win with Spain.

After Eduardo was relegated to the bench at his new club, S.L. Benfica, Patrício became the starter under national team boss Paulo Bento, and both players finished the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with five games (450 minutes) as Portugal qualified for the final stages. He was the starter in the finals in Poland and Ukraine, conceding four goals in five matches in an eventual semi-final exit.

Patrício was included in Bento's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup as first-choice, and made his debut in the competition in the first encounter against Germany, which ended with a 0–4 loss. He missed the second game against the United States, due to injury.

Patrício appeared in his 50th international on 30 June 2016, during Euro 2016: after the 1–1 draw to Poland at the "Stade Vélodrome" during the first 120 minutes, he saved Jakub Błaszczykowski's attempt in a 5–3 penalty shootout win that qualified to the semi-finals. Having won the tournament with a solid display in the final, he also made the squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Willy Boly

Willy-Arnaud Zobo Boly (born 3 February 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Born in Melun, Seine-et-Marne, Boly played youth football for three clubs, also having a three-year spell at the INF Clairefontaine academy. He made his senior debut with AJ Auxerre's reserves and, in February 2011, he signed his first professional contract after agreeing to a three-year deal with an option for a fourth.

On 16 April 2011, Boly made his Ligue 1 debut by playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Toulouse FC. He scored his first goal in the competition the following matchday, in a 1–1 home draw to RC Lens.

Boly was an undisputed starter in the 2011–12 season (33 games, one goal), but the "AJA" were relegated to Ligue 2 after finishing last.

On 1 September 2014, Boly moved to Portugal and joined S.C. Braga on a four-year deal. He spent his first season with the B-team, in the Segunda Liga.

On 31 August 2016, Boly signed a five-year contract with FC Porto with a €45 million buyout clause. He played only eight competitive matches during his spell, including the 0–1 away loss against Juventus F.C. for the last-16 stage of the UEFA Champions League where he featured the second half after coming on as a substitute for André Silva.

On 8 July 2017, Boly joined EFL Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a season-long loan, reuniting him with his former head coach Nuno Espírito Santo. He made his competitive debut for the latter on the opening day of the season, a 1–0 home win against Middlesbrough, and scored his first goal on 31 October to help to a 2–0 away win over Norwich City.

After helping achieve promotion while making 37 official appearances, Boly signed a permanent contract. He made his Premier League debut on 11 August 2018, in a 2–2 home draw against Everton. He scored his first goal in the competition two weeks later in a 1–1 home draw to Manchester City, but the goal proved controversial as television replays showed the ball was deflected into the goal by his forearm after glancing off his head.

Born to Ivorian parents, Boly represented France at under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels.

Conor Coady

Conor David Coady (born 25 February 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Coady came through the academy system at his local club Liverpool and made two appearances for the first team before spending a season on loan at Sheffield United and then moving to Huddersfield Town on a permanent transfer in 2014. He has also represented England at youth level, being named in the team of the tournament as England won the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and captaining the England under-20 team at the 2013 under-20 World Cup.

Born in Liverpool, Coady grew up supporting Liverpool. He is a product of the Liverpool Youth Academy after joining the club in 2005. During the 2010–11 season, Coady was on the fringes of the first team, making the subs bench twice but failed to make a first-team appearance. Coady played every Reserve League and NextGen Series match during the 2011–12 season, scoring five goals. Despite being named in the senior squad list and being called up to the senior squad occasionally from 2009, he did not make his senior début until 8 November 2012 in a UEFA Europa League group stage match against Anzhi Makhachkala. After Andre Wisdom's promotion as a full-time senior squad member, Conor Coady was installed as full-time captain of the Under-21 squad and on 12 May 2013 he made his Premier League début in a 3–1 win at Fulham.

Coady agreed a six-month loan deal with League One club Sheffield United on 22 July 2013, later stating that he had turned down the chance to go on Liverpool's pre-season tour of Australia and the Far East in order to join up with his new club. Coady made his debut for the Blades in the opening fixture of the following season, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 home victory over Notts County, and made his first start for the club in the following game, a League Cup first round defeat to League Two club Burton Albion. 

Coady scored his first senior goal in a 1–1 draw at Leyton Orient on 30 November 2013. Having been in and out of the team during the first half of the season, Coady began to cement a regular first-team place over the Christmas period, prompting United to extend his loan spell during the January transfer window, and once more in February to extend his stay until the end of the season. Coady played regularly for the Blades for the remainder of the season and returned to Anfield having played 50 games and scored six goals.

On 6 August 2014, Coady signed for Championship club Huddersfield Town on a three-year deal for a fee, believed to be around £500,000. He made his début as a substitute in the 4–0 defeat by Bournemouth on 9 August. On 1 October, he scored his first goal for the club against Wolverhampton Wanderers where Town won 3–1 at Molineux Stadium. He again found the net, this time in a 2–2 draw against Rotherham United.

On 3 July 2015, Coady signed for Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £2 million. He scored his first goal for Wolves in a 2–1 EFL Cup win against Crawley Town on 9 August 2016. 

As of the start of the 2017–18 season, Coady has, at the behest of Wolves' manager Nuno Espírito Santo, played at centre-half in a three-man defence for Wolves.

It was announced in September 2017 that Coady had signed a new four-year contract with Wolves, running until summer 2021.

On 21 April 2018, during his 120th league appearance for Wolves, Coady scored a 66th minute penalty in a 4–0 win against Bolton Wanderers to get his first league goal for the club, as Wolves sealed the EFL Championship title.

It was announced on 15 February 2019 that Coady had put pen to paper on a new contract that would keep him at Wolverhampton Wanderers until the summer of 2023.

Coady has represented England at Under-16 right through to Under-20 level. He has been capped 17 times for the England national under-17 football team. He played and captained the England team at the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Liechtenstein where he and his England colleagues won the tournament, and became the first England team to win an international tournament in 17 years. He was then part of the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Estonia in which England got as far as the semi-finals where they were knocked out by Greece. He was named captain of the England under-20 team by manager Peter Taylor for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made his debut for the team on 16 June, in a 3–0 win in a warm-up game against Uruguay. On 23 June, he scored in the opening group-stage game against Iraq.

Diogo Jota

Diogo José Teixeira da Silva (born 4 December 1996), known as Diogo Jota, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

He started playing with Paços de Ferreira, signing with Atlético Madrid after two seasons in the Primeira Liga and being consecutively loaned to Porto and Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 2018, he moved to the latter club on a permanent deal.

Jota played for Portugal at under-19, under-21 and under-23 levels.

Born in Massarelos, Porto, Jota joined F.C. Paços de Ferreira's youth setup in 2013, from Gondomar SC. He was promoted to the main squad at the start of the 2014–15 season, and made his senior debut on 19 October 2014 by starting in a 4–0 home win against Atlético S.C. for the Taça de Portugal.

Jota first appeared in the Primeira Liga on 20 February 2015, coming on as a late substitute for Diogo Rosado in a 2–2 home draw against Vitória de Guimarães. He scored his first goals in the competition on 17 May, netting a brace in a 3–2 home success over Académica de Coimbra and becoming the youngest player to score for the club in the top tier in the process.

On 30 May 2015, Jota signed a new five-year deal with Paços, keeping him tied up until 2020. In the first game of the campaign, a 1–0 win over Académica at the "Estádio da Mata Real" on 17 August, he was sent off at the end for pushing Hugo Seco; Ricardo Nascimento was also sent off for retaliating on his teammate's behalf.

On 14 March 2016, Jota agreed a five-year contract with Atlético Madrid effective as of 1 July. On 26 August, however, he returned to his country and joined FC Porto on a one-year loan. On 1 October he scored a first-half hat-trick in a 4–0 away victory against C.D. Nacional.

On 25 July 2017, Jota moved to English Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a season-long loan. He scored his first goal on 15 August, in a 3–2 away win over Hull City.

On 30 January 2018, it was announced that a permanent deal with Jota had been agreed, being made effective on 1 July. He scored a career-best 17 goals in his first year, ranking fifth in the individual charts in a Premier League promotion as champions; due to English Football League regulations, he wore his legal surname on his jersey in the Championship but was able to change it to "Diogo J" after the feat.

Jota made his debut in the English top division on 11 August 2018, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–2 home draw against Everton. He scored his first goal in the competition on 5 December, helping the hosts come from behind to beat Chelsea 2–1. His second came four days later, in a win at Newcastle United by the same scoreline.

On 19 January 2019, Jota netted three times in the 4–3 home defeat of Leicester City – his second career hat-trick. In the process, he became only the second Portuguese player to achieve the feat in the Premier League after Cristiano Ronaldo 11 years earlier. This was a first-ever for the club in the competition and a first for the club in the top flight of English football since John Richards, against the same opposition, in the Football League First Division in October 1977.

Jota started playing for Portugal at under-19 level, scoring his first goal on 29 May 2015 in a 6–1 home routing of Turkey for the UEFA European Championship qualifying phase. He won his first cap for the under-21 team on 17 November of the same year at not yet 19, playing 15 minutes in the 3–0 away defeat of Israel in another qualifier.

On 25 May 2018, Jota netted a brace for the under-21s in their 3–2 friendly win over Italy held in Estoril.

In March 2019, Jota was called up to the senior side for the first time, ahead of the opening UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying matches.

John Ruddy

John Thomas Gordon Ruddy (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United, before signing for Everton as a 19-year-old. He spent five years with Everton, but made just one appearance, while playing on loan at nine different clubs. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League.

The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. However, on 25 May 2012, he was ruled out after breaking his finger during training. He made his debut in a 2–1 win against Italy in August 2012. He suffered a long term thigh injury in November 2012, but returned to help Norwich to an 11th-place finish at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.

Born in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United and made his professional debut in the final match of the 2003–04 season at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium on 8 May 2004, keeping a clean sheet and saving a penalty. Ruddy earned his place as Cambridge's first choice keeper in the 2004–05 season, making 38 appearances in a season that saw the U's relegated from league two after finishing bottom with 30 points. This was despite Ruddy's tremendous efforts, which included keeping 9 clean sheets and conceding just 45 goals.

Ruddy had a trial at Manchester United in November 2004, before moving to Everton in the summer of 2005 for a fee of around £250,000 that would rise depending on appearances.

Ruddy was called into the England Under-19 squad in 2005 after being scouted by England goalkeeping coach Ray Clemence and was touted by his manager David Moyes as a future England goalkeeper.

In September 2005, Ruddy signed for Walsall on loan, making four appearances in League One before returning to Everton. Loan spells with Rushden & Diamonds and Chester City followed.

Ruddy made his first and only appearance for Everton in February 2006 in unusual circumstances. Nine minutes into the match against Blackburn Rovers, Iain Turner was sent off for handling outside the area. Since Turner was substituting for injured first- and second-choice keepers Nigel Martyn and Richard Wright, it meant that Ruddy was the only keeper left who could play. Ruddy went on to keep a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.

In September 2006, Ruddy went on loan again. A one-month deal was agreed with Stockport County, which was extended to three months after some impressive performances. He then agreed a one-month loan with Wrexham in February 2007, but failed to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month. On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club Bristol City, and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over Carlisle United, and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion. In January 2009, he went out on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season to Crewe Alexandra.

On 24 July 2009, Ruddy joined Scottish Premier League club Motherwell on a six-month loan deal, to vie with Michael Fraser and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal. Ruddy kept clean sheets during a 0–0 home draw against Rangers on 12 September 2009 and a 0–0 away draw against Celtic on 17 October 2009. He also saved a Barry Robson penalty in a 3–2 loss to Celtic on 12 December 2009. When the original loan deal expired in January 2010, the Fir Park club decided that they wanted to keep Ruddy for longer and an extension of a month was agreed with Everton. On 27 January 2010, it was announced that both Ruddy and Everton teammate Lukas Jutkiewicz were to extend their stay at the Scottish Premier League club until May 2010. Ruddy finished the Scottish Premier League season with 15 clean sheets from 34 appearances.

On 5 July 2010, Ruddy signed for Championship club Norwich City for an undisclosed fee, which Ruddy revealed in 2017 to have been £250,000. In 2012, Paul Lambert revealed that on two earlier occasions he had considered signing Ruddy for clubs he'd previously managed: "It is funny but ... [I] ... went to watch him for Crewe at MK Dons ... but he had an absolute stinker. We also saw him when he was at Stockport and ... I decided against him at that time, but when Fraser went and it was clear we wouldn't be able to get him back again I knew John had had a really good season at Motherwell. There was that clamour to sign Fraser, but with the finances we just couldn't do that. I wanted somebody with the same stature, a big goalkeeper, and John had that."

Ruddy made his debut for City against Watford in the opening fixture of the 2010–11 season which Norwich lost 3–2 at Carrow Road. He kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 1–0 away win against Scunthorpe United on 14 August 2010, following this up with another clean sheet against Swansea on 21 August 2010 which included a penalty save that atoned for his error that led to it. In Ruddy's first season for Norwich, he played 45 out of the 46 league matches, helping City to the Premier League, keeping a clean sheet during the 1–0 away win against Portsmouth on 2 May 2011 which sealed promotion for the Canaries.

Ruddy started the 2011–12 season as the first choice keeper again for Norwich, starting the 1–1 draw at the DW Stadium against Wigan Athletic. He followed this up by making numerous good saves during Norwich's first home premier league match in seven years in a 1–1 draw against Stoke, including a penalty stop against Jon Walters and a save denying Matthew Etherington from a direct free kick. During the next match, he received his only red card of the season in the match against Chelsea after a foul on Ramires that led to a penalty. However, Ruddy's fortunes were reversed during the return fixture against Chelsea on 21 January 2012 when he kept his first clean sheet of the season during a 0–0 draw at Carrow Road, making several impressive stops from Fernando Torres. Ruddy was voted Player's Player of the Season following Norwich's 12th-place finish, this was a testament to Ruddy's performances for a highly attacking Norwich team, leading to suggestions that he should be called up for Roy Hodgson's England Euro 2012 squad. Ruddy's claim for a squad place was only strengthened by his excellent performance during the 2–0 home win against Aston Villa on the final day of the season.

For the 2012–13 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of Declan Rudd, Jed Steer and new goalie Mark Bunn. Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1–1 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although Bobby Zamora scored the rebound. He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1–0 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches. Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1–1 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury. He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months. However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April. Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4–0 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation. He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3–2 away win against Manchester City.

Despite the previous long term injury, Ruddy started the 2013–14 season as Norwich's first choice keeper in the 2–2 draw with Everton at Carrow Road on 17 August 2013. Ruddy had a tough start to the season which included mistake riddled performances against Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester City. However, since the 5–1 away thrashing at Liverpool Ruddy has been in fine form keeping four clean sheets in nine matches, conceding just seven goals. During this spell Ruddy produced some outstanding performances, including the 2–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion on 7 December 2013 where he saved eight shots, including a brilliant tip around the post from a close range Shane Long header.

In May 2017, it was announced that Ruddy would be released when his contract expired. All the players who were being released were given the option of whether or not they chose to be available for selection in the one remaining match of the season. In the end, Ruddy was the only one of the seven who played in the match, being made team captain for the day (he had previously captained the side for one match in the 2013–14 season when Sébastien Bassong and Russell Martin were both absent) and saw out his time with the club by keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over Queens Park Rangers.

On 10 July 2017, Ruddy signed a two-year contract with Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers. His signing came days after the club's previous number one Carl Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia. On 6 April 2018, Ruddy saved an injury time penalty from Gary Madine away at Cardiff City in a 1–0 win, in a victory that took Wolves nine points clear of Cardiff. Ruddy became the team's main goalkeeper and was part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League as champions. He was named in the division's PFA Team of the Year and was awarded the EFL's Golden Glove Award for the most clean sheets with 24.

In August 2018 he extended his contract with Wolves, signing a deal due to last until summer 2020, despite having fallen behind new addition Rui Patrício as the club's first-choice goalkeeper.

On 16 May 2012, Ruddy received his first senior international call-up when Roy Hodgson selected him as a member of the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. However, a broken finger ruled him out of the tournament, and Jack Butland was called up to replace him. Ruddy was called up for the friendly against Italy in Bern, Switzerland, on 10 August 2012, along with Butland and Joe Hart. He came on for Butland at half-time to make his senior England debut, and made some key saves as England won the match 2–1, keeping a clean sheet in his first England appearance after Butland conceded in the first half.

Ruddy was not included in Hodgson's World Cup squad, with Joe Hart, Fraser Forster and Ben Foster selected instead.

Ruddy married his wife Laura on 2 June 2012. Prior to the Euro 2012 tournament, he jokingly cited breaking his finger as the reason he was able to have his wedding on that date. He is nicknamed "The Iceman".

He began his professional career with Sporting, moving in 2010 to Porto and winning 12 major titles between the two clubs combined. Three years later he transferred to Monaco for €25 million, conquering the Ligue 1 championship in the 2016–17 season.

Moutinho represented the Portuguese national team at three European Championships and two World Cups, winning the 2016 edition of the former tournament.

Moutinho was born in Barreiro, Setúbal District. After showing great promise as a boy playing for Portimonense SC, he signed with Sporting CP when he turned 13 to continue his football education.

During the 2004–05 pre-season, at only 17 years of age, Moutinho was called by manager José Peseiro to the main squad, where he played some games and displayed some talent early on. However, he then returned to the junior team coached by Paulo Bento and featured alongside such players such as Miguel Veloso and Nani, helping the side win the national title that season, although he was also regularly training with the main squad.

In the beginning of 2005, Moutinho was called up for a game in the Taça de Portugal, eventually playing 20 minutes against F.C. Pampilhosa, and made his Primeira Liga debut on 23 January, staying in the entire 3–0 win at Gil Vicente F.C. and wearing the #28 shirt previously worn by Cristiano Ronaldo. Based on highly consistent displays, he wasted no time in establishing himself as a regular while being able to play in any position across a flat midfield or in a diamond formation; his box-to-box dynamism and determination quickly made him a firm fan favourite, as he rarely missed a game since becoming first-choice.

Moutinho's performances in the closing stages of the campaign, especially in the UEFA Cup with man of the match displays against Feyenoord and Newcastle United that helped the "Lions" reach the final of the competition, made him an automatic starter for Sporting despite his young age; he contributed with 15 league games as Sporting finished second and, during the summer, he penned a one-year extension with the club.
In his first full season, Moutinho's further progress and exceptional consistency (he was the only player to play every minute of every match in the domestic league) was one of the brightest spots in Sporting's runner-up final place. Incidentally, he scored his team's final goal of the campaign, a 1–0 win over S.C. Braga to ensure a return to UEFA Champions League football for the Lisbon club.

In 2006–07, following the departure of veteran Ricardo Sá Pinto, Moutinho was made vice-captain at just 19 years of age. The following season, after Custódio and Ricardo also left, he would be named captain, the second youngest in the history of the club's professional football, behind first captain and associate founder Francisco Stromp.

That campaign, with Leandro Romagnoli (an attacking midfielder) also in the starting eleven, Moutinho, more often than not, moved from his natural "behind-the-forwards" midfield role to the right flank, where he still managed to deliver impressive performances. Additionally, he began earning plaudits as one of the league's top players.

In 2008–09, after an aborted deal with Premier League's Everton, Moutinho was again ever present, only missing three league matches (almost 50 presences overall) as Sporting finished once again runners-up; he also had the dubious distinction of netting his side's only goal in the Champions League round-of-16 clash against FC Bayern Munich, a 1–12 aggregate loss.

On 3 July 2010, Moutinho signed a five-year contract with Sporting rivals FC Porto, with the transfer price reaching €11 million (€1M being paid for 50% of the rights to central defender Nuno André Coelho); additionally, Sporting would receive 25% of any added value (Portuguese: "mais valia") occurring during that time frame, provided it surpassed the previous value. Sporting Chairman José Eduardo Bettencourt described Moutinho's conduct as deplorable and called him a "rotten apple", adding: "The deal was done because Sporting wanted it, because it did not want a rotten apple in its orchard, and it did not want someone who was not an example, nor dignified the flag of the club." Soon after, Porto sold 37.5% of the player's economic rights to a third party, Mamers BV, for €4,125,000.

Moutinho was an ever-present figure for Porto in his first season. He appeared in 50 official games as the northerners won the league and, even though he did not score in league competition, he netted twice in the campaign's Portuguese Cup, most notably in a 3–1 away win against S.L. Benfica, with his team overcoming the 0–2 home loss in the first leg to reach the final, in which the player also appeared, against Vitória de Guimarães (6–2); he added another 90 minutes in the Europa League final, and the club won the treble.

On 3 August 2011, Porto partnered with Soccer Invest Fund to buy back 37.5% of Moutinho's economic rights. The private investment fund acquired 15% after the overall transactions, while Porto recouped 22.5% for €4 million; the residual 15% was acquired by Porto in 2013, for €3.3 million.

Moutinho scored a rare goal on 19 February 2013, helping his team to a 1–0 home win over Málaga CF for the season's Champions League round-of-16, netting from close range after an Alex Sandro cross (eventual 1–2 aggregate loss). He played 43 contests during the campaign all competitions comprised (five goals, 3,515 minutes of action), as both team and player won their third consecutive league championship.

On 24 May 2013, it was announced that Moutinho had joined AS Monaco FC alongside teammate James Rodríguez for a combined fee believed to be around €70 million (€25 million for Moutinho). He made his official debut for his new club on 1 September, starting and setting up both goals in a 2–1 win at Olympique de Marseille which put Monaco to the top of Ligue 1.

Moutinho was first-choice in his debut campaign, as the principality team finished runners-up straight out of Ligue 2. His only goal was an equaliser in a 1–1 away draw to Stade de Reims, on 29 September.

On 16 September 2014, in Monaco's first Champions League match since 2005, Moutinho scored the only goal in a home defeat of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. He finished the season with 52 overall appearances, in an eventual third-place finish for the Leonardo Jardim-led side.

Moutinho contributed with two goals from 31 matches during 2016–17, helping the club to the eighth national championship of its history.

On 24 July 2018, Moutinho joined newly-promoted English club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a two-year-deal for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around £5 million. He made his Premier League debut on 11 August, featuring 85 minutes in a 2–2 home draw against Everton. His first goal in the competition arrived on 22 September, when he scored from just outside the box with his weaker left foot in a 1–1 away draw to Manchester United.

A full Portugal international at the age of 18, Moutinho made his debut on 17 August 2005 in a 2–0 home friendly win against Egypt in Ponta Delgada. Ever since the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he became a regular call-up.

On 31 May 2008, Moutinho registered his first goal for the national team in a 2–0 friendly victory over Georgia at "Estádio do Fontelo" in Viseu. He was picked for the squad-of-23 for UEFA Euro 2008 and, in the opening game, assisted on a goal by Raul Meireles in a 2–0 victory against Turkey.

Moutinho also played in two UEFA European Under-21 Championships, scoring against Germany in the 2006 edition, played on home soil, as the Portuguese exited in the group stage on both occasions; additionally, although not part of the provisional 24-player list for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he was named in a backup list of six players.

Moutinho played all the games and minutes at the Euro 2012 tournament. In the semi-finals against Spain, he missed his penalty shootout attempt in an eventual 2–4 loss (0–0 after 120 minutes).

Moutinho was selected by former Sporting boss Bento for the 2014 World Cup, making his debut in the tournament on 16 June in a 0–4 group stage defeat to Germany. On 8 October 2015, he scored the only goal as Portugal defeated Denmark at the Estádio Municipal de Braga to seal qualification for Euro 2016, and three days later was also on the scoresheet in a 2–1 win away to Serbia which confirmed his team's position as group winners.

After six appearances out of a possible seven to help his nation win the European Championships for the first time ever, Moutinho was also picked for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup squad by Fernando Santos. In the latter competition, in the final group stage game in Saint Petersburg, he won his 100th cap by playing the full 90 minutes in the 4–0 defeat of New Zealand.

Moutinho was included in the 2018 World Cup squad.

Moutinho's father, Nélson, was also a footballer. A forward, he played for several clubs during a 15-year senior career.

Will Norris

William James Norris (born 12 August 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Without a club at the start of the 2011–12 season, Norris made an approach to join Hertfordshire side Royston Town who in the previous season had narrowly missed out on promotion after finishing 3rd in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division. He played a number of games for the reserve team where his performances caught the attention of then first team manager, Paul Attfield, who pulled him into the first team. On 20 September 2011, he made his debut for Royston in a 4–1 home win against Haringey Borough in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup. Norris went on to make 41 appearances in all competitions in 2011–12 helping the club to secure the Spartan South Midlands Premier Division title and a cup double which included the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup and the South Midlands Floodlit Cup. In the quarter final of the Cambridgeshire Invitation Cup against Cambridge City on 25 January 2012, the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out in which Norris pulled off a number of saves in sudden death before scoring the winning penalty to send Royston into the semi-final.

On 16 July 2012, Norris signed for Cambridge United on a two-year deal and was loaned back to Royston Town for the duration of the 2012–13 season, helping the club to a 7th-place finish in the Southern Football League Division One Central.

Norris spent the first half of the season 2013–14 with Cambridge as second choice to Chris Maxwell, before re-joining Royston in December 2013 on a short-term loan spell. He was recalled to make his first team debut for Cambridge in a 1–0 away win at Tamworth in the Conference Premier on 21 January 2014. On 30 January 2014, he signed a new contract with the club which extended his previous deal by two and a half years to 2016. He went on to make a total of 15 league appearances helping Cambridge make a return to The Football League, after a nine-year absence, via the Conference play-offs. Norris kept a clean sheet in Cambridge's 4–0 victory over Gosport Borough in the 2013–14 FA Trophy Final.

Norris made his Football League debut for Cambridge in a 2–2 draw at home to Accrington Stanley on 11 April 2015. He went on to make a total of 3 appearances in the league in 2014–15 as Cambridge finished 19th in their first season back in the Football League. At the end of the season his contract was extended to 2018, and was loaned to Braintree Town for the beginning of 2015–16. On 8 August 2015, he made his debut for Braintree in a 1–0 away defeat to Chester City in the National League. After a run of impressive performances, keeping four clean sheets in six games, he was named the National League's Player of the Month for October. At the time of collecting the award Norris had amassed 9 clean sheets in the league; the most of any goalkeeper in the top 5 English divisions. On 9 January 2016, Norris was recalled from his loan with Braintree. He went on to make a total of 21 league appearances for Cambridge, keeping 9 clean sheets, as the club finished 9th in League Two. His contract was extended by a further year, to 2019.

In the 2016–17 season Norris saved a club record of five penalties in one season, including two in second half stoppage time against Accrington Stanley. The gloves he used in the double penalty save against Accrington raised £1,000 at a charity auction, with the proceeds being donated to injured footballers Shaun Whiter and Joey Abbs, who were victims of a hit-and-run incident.

On 11 July 2017, Norris signed a three-year deal for Wolverhampton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee, a day after the Championship club had signed a fellow former Cambridge goalkeeper, John Ruddy. He made his debut for the club on 8 August 2017 in a 1–0 win against Yeovil Town in the second round of the Carabao Cup. Norris made his league debut for Wolves on 6 May 2018 against Sunderland.

Leander Dendoncker

Leander Dendoncker (born 15 April 1995) is a Belgian international footballer who plays as either a defender or defensive midfielder, for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan from Anderlecht.

He joined Anderlecht in 2009 and made his professional debut in July 2013, going on to play 171 games for the club and score 11 goals. He won two Belgian Super Cups and a Belgian First Division A title. He made his senior international debut for Belgium in June 2015 and was part of their squad that finished third at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Dendoncker transferred from K.S.V. Roeselare to R.S.C. Anderlecht in 2009, choosing that club ahead of Standard Liège, Club Brugge and K.R.C. Genk. After performances for the youth team in the NextGen Series and a training camp in Turkey, he was incorporated into the first team in January 2013. He models his game on that of the Spanish midfielder Sergio Busquets.

He made his professional debut on 21 July in the 2013 Belgian Super Cup, replacing Dennis Praet for the final nine minutes of the 1–0 win over Genk at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. On 26 September, he extended his contract until 2016.

However, it was not until 1 August 2014 that he debuted in the Belgian Pro League, on the first day of the season away to KV Oostende. After scoring his first professional goal on 18 January 2015 in a 3–0 win at Lierse S.K., Dendoncker was praised by former Anderlecht player Paul Van Himst, who said that there was no better player at his position in the club. He played six matches in the 2014–15 Belgian Cup, which his team lost 2–1 in the final to Brugge.

Anderlecht won the 2016–17 Belgian First Division A. Dendoncker scored five goals along the way, including two on 18 December in a 4–0 home win over K.A.S. Eupen. He also played all 16 games in their European campaign that season, which ended with elimination by eventual winners Manchester United in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Europa League. In the first leg of that tie on 13 April 2017, he scored a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw.

On 9 August 2018 Dendoncker moved to newly promoted English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers on an initial season-long loan which is to become permanent in summer 2019. He made his debut on 28 August in the second round of the EFL Cup away to Sheffield Wednesday (2–0 victory), with coach Nuno Espírito Santo making nine changes from the previous game. In late September, The Football Association rejected the obligatory purchase clause in Dendoncker's Wolves contract and made his deal became permanent for €15 million. 

He finally made a league appearance on 5 December in a 2–1 win against Chelsea, playing the final nine minutes in place of goalscorer Raúl Jiménez, and scored his first Premier League goal on his sixth appearance in the competition, in a 1–3 win at Everton on 2 February 2019.

Dendoncker was first called up for the Belgium national football team on 22 May 2015 by manager Marc Wilmots, along with his Anderlecht teammate Youri Tielemans. He made his debut on 7 June in a friendly game away to France, replacing Jason Denayer for the final five minutes of a 4–3 win.

On 4 June 2018, manager Roberto Martínez named Dendoncker in Belgium's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He made his tournament debut on 29 June in a 1–0 win over England at the Kaliningrad Stadium, with both teams fielding unfamiliar teams having already advanced to the last 16.

Dendoncker was born in Passendale, West Flanders to pig farming parents. He is the middle of three footballing sons: in May 2017, his elder brother Andres was playing for Roeselare and his younger brother Lars had been given his first professional contract aged 16 at Brugge.

Dendoncker moved to Brussels to play for Anderlecht while in their under-15 team and suffered from homesickness while adjusting to the difference between a largely white rural setting and a diverse urban environment. He attended the Sint-Guido-Instituut school in Anderlecht at the time that it was being filmed for the fly-on-the-wall documentary "De School van Lukaku" (Lukaku's School) focusing on his teammate Romelu Lukaku. He has noted that he speaks in West Flemish to his family, but the Brabantian dialect when doing interviews for Anderlecht.

Born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Bonatini joined Cruzeiro's youth setup in 2010, aged 16. In July 2012 he was loaned to Italian Serie A club Juventus for one season, with a buyout clause.

Bonatini only appeared for the club's "Primavera" squad, and subsequently returned to Cruzeiro in the 2013 summer. On 2 October 2013 he moved to Goiás, also in a temporary deal until the end of the year.

Bonatini made his professional – and Série A – debut on 27 October, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 away win against Náutico. He appeared in five further matches for "Esmeraldino" during the campaign, and had his loan contract renewed for a further year on 7 January 2014.

On 5 August 2014, Bonatini's loan was cut short, due to the lack of opportunities in the main squad.

On 5 January 2015, he was loaned to Primeira Liga side Estoril Praia, until June.

On 13 July 2015, Bonatini had 50% of his federative rights sold to Traffic Group, remaining at Estoril permanently.

Harry Burgoyne

Harry James Burgoyne (born 28 December 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Falkirk, on loan from club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

He has also played for Lowestoft Town, Corby Town, A.F.C. Telford United and Barnet on loan.

Burgoyne joined Wolverhampton Wanderers at the age of 12, having been spotted filling in as a goalkeeper for the first time for local team Ludlow Town. Following unsuccessful trials at West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City, he signed an initial two-year deal with the club before committing to a two-year professional contract in March 2015.

He joined Doncaster Rovers for a brief youth loan at the age of 16, which included an FA Youth Cup appearance against Manchester City. Burgoyne was nominated for Wolves' Academy Player of the Season for the 2014–15 season, which was won by Regan Upton.

In May 2015, he was part of the squad that won the U19 Bitzer Cup in Germany. Burgoyne played four of the five games, conceding just a single goal. The final went to penalties and he saved the fifth one with Wolves winning 5–4. Burgoyne joined the first-team squad on a pre-season tour of France in July 2015.

He attended Bitterley Primary School and Ludlow School, where he was a school prefect, head of house and sports captain.

In September 2015, Burgoyne gained his first experience of senior football with a one-month loan at National League North side Lowestoft Town. After recording a clean sheet on his debut, he claimed the Man of the Match award in the two following games. Making five appearances for the side, an initial extension on the loan was cut short after being recalled due to injuries in the Wolves U21 squad.

In November 2015, Burgoyne joined National League North club Corby Town on a one-month loan. He made six appearances prior to his return. As part of the agreements between the two sides, Burgoyne continued to train with Wolverhampton Wanderers during his loan spell and was made available on matchdays.

Burgoyne returned to Wolves in December 2018, having never played a competitive game for Argyle, after his loan was terminated by both clubs by mutual consent.

He then moved on loan to Scottish Championship club Falkirk in January 2019.

At the age of fifteen, after impressing for Torre Pacheco, he signed a contract for Real Murcia.

On 29 August 2016 Ruddy signed for Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a two-year deal, with the option of a further year, for an undisclosed fee. He was named on the bench once over the season, for a 3–1 loss at Derby County on 29 April 2017. In December 2017, he extended his contract until the end of the 2019–20 campaign.

On 31 August 2017, Ruddy was sent on loan to League One side Oldham Athletic until 1 January. He was then loaned to Scottish League One club Ayr United.
