Łukasz Fabiański

Łukasz Fabiański (; born 18 April 1985) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club West Ham United and the Poland national team.

Having begun his career at Legia Warsaw, Fabiański joined Arsenal for £2.1 million in 2007, and was mainly used as back-up, but played as the club won the 2014 FA Cup Final. On the expiration of his contract in 2014, he joined Swansea.

A full international for Poland since 2006, Fabiański has represented his country on over 40 occasions and was included in the squads for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. He played every match for Poland at Euro 2016 after the first group match with Northern Ireland due to first-choice goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny's injury.

Fabiański was born in Kostrzyn nad Odrą. After starting his career with Polonia Słubice, Fabiański joined the noted independent football academy MSP Szamotuły at age 14, where he honed his footballing skills. Fabiański then was signed in the 2004–05 season by Lech Poznań.

In the winter of 2005, Fabiański was signed by Legia Warsaw, where he competed with Artur Boruc for a place in the team. After Boruc was sold to Celtic, Fabiański took over as starting goalkeeper on 24 July 2005 in a match against Arka Gdynia, which ended 0–0. The following season, he helped Legia win the 2005–06 Ekstraklasa. He started all 30 matches of the campaign, in which he conceded 17 goals.

In the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, his performances led to him being awarded the "Football Oscar" for the best goalkeeper in the Ekstraklasa.

On 8 May 2007, Fabiański underwent medical tests in London after Arsenal agreed a transfer fee with Legia Warsaw worth approximately £2.1 million. The move was confirmed on 11 May 2007 by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger. Fabiański formally signed for Arsenal on 26 May with a long-term contract. He made his debut for the club in a 2–0 League Cup win over Newcastle United on 25 September 2007.

In Fabiański's early Arsenal career, two of his most notable appearances came in the 5–1 defeat to rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the 2007–08 League Cup semi-final and the first leg of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League second round match with Porto. Fabiański received criticism for conceding soft goals in the Porto match as he scored an own goal and was blamed for the second goal after picking up a backpass from Sol Campbell, with Porto scoring from the resulting free-kick. In January 2010, Arsène Wenger stated that Łukasz Fabiański could become one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League.

Fabiański played the last four matches for Arsenal in the 2009–10 season after top-choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia suffered a wrist injury. He was criticised for conceding soft goals in the defeats to Wigan Athletic and Blackburn Rovers, but kept clean sheets in the matches at home to Manchester City and Fulham.

Fabiański started the 2010–11 season as Arsenal's second-choice goalkeeper. On 21 September 2010, he made his first start of the season in a League Cup match against neighbours Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, which Arsenal won 4–1 after extra time. Fabiański almost cost the match for Arsenal as he failed to stop Robbie Keane's long-range effort, despite getting a hand to the shot. After the match, he revealed he was disappointed. He had a solid match in his second match of the season replacing the injured Manuel Almunia one week later in a UEFA Champions League 3–1 away win against Partizan. He saved Cléo's second penalty of the match in the second half to deny Partizan a lifeline. He later turned Ivica Iliev's effort around the post from point-blank range just before the final whistle. Arsène Wenger later commented that Fabiański had a "faultless" match and they finally saw the player who they usually see in training. He kept his first clean sheet in a win over Manchester City, where he made many saves in a match that ended 3–0. He was later named man of the match on an Arsenal.com poll after a brilliant display to keep Arsenal in the match. After the City match, Wenger admitted he could well become the club's number one goalkeeper after impressive displays in the matches since the Partizan match.

On 7 November 2010, Fabiański was widely criticised for an error that lead to the only goal as Arsenal lost at home to Newcastle United. However, he produced a strong display to keep a clean sheet in the next Premier League match, against Wolverhampton Wanderers, in which he managed to prevent a draw with a last-minute save, and then initiating a counter-attack with a long throw of the ball that led to another Arsenal goal. After the Wolves match, Arsenal played Everton, where Fabiański received the man of the match award from Sky Sports.

Fabiański was injured for Arsenal's crucial match with Manchester United but returned for the equally important match with London rivals Chelsea, making many crucial saves in helping Arsenal to win 3–1. On 5 January 2011, he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury as he was warming up with the help of Wojciech Szczęsny, which ruled him out for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. During this period, Szczęsny established himself as Arsenal's first choice goalkeeper ahead of his Polish compatriot.

Fabiański spent the 2011–12 season as backup to Wojciech Szczęsny, making his first appearance against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup.

On 6 December 2011, Fabiański was selected to start in Arsenal's UEFA Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos, but was substituted out after 25 minutes following a knee injury.

Injuries limited Fabiański's appearances during the 2012–13 season, where he made only five Premier League appearances as back-up to Wojciech Szczęsny. In March 2013, after Szczęsny was dropped, Fabiański started in goal in the second-leg of Arsenal's UEFA Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. He kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2–0 and retained his place in the team to make his first Premier League start of the season away against Swansea City on 16 March 2013, again keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. Fabiański started in Arsenal's next three league matches against Reading, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City. However, an injury sustained in the match against Norwich by Fabiański allowed Szczęsny to return to the starting line-up and reclaim his position as first-choice goalkeeper.

During the 2013–14 season, Fabiański was used as Arsenal's starting goalkeeper in FA Cup and League Cup matches, with Szczęsny remaining first-choice in Premier League and UEFA Champions League matches.

On 19 February 2014, Fabiański came on as a substitute in the 37th minute of a 2–0 Champions League home defeat against Bayern Munich, after Szczęsny was sent off for a foul on Arjen Robben. With Szczęsny suspended, Fabiański was in the starting line-up for the second leg and saved a late penalty from Bayern's Thomas Müller.

On 12 April, Fabiański saved penalties from Gary Caldwell and Jack Collison in an FA Cup semi-final shootout victory over Wigan Athletic. He made his only Premier League appearance of the season in the last match on 11 May, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win that caused his opponents Norwich City to be relegated. Six days later, Fabiański started for Arsenal in the 2014 FA Cup Final as they defeated Hull City 3–2 after extra time at Wembley Stadium.

On 29 May 2014, it was announced that Fabiański would join fellow Premier League side Swansea City on a free transfer when his Arsenal contract expired on 1 July. He said of the transfer, "The main reason I came to Swansea was because I want to be the number one goalkeeper." He made his competitive debut for the club on 16 August, a 2–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first match of the Premier League season. On 7 December 2014, Fabiański was sent off in Swansea's 1–3 loss at West Ham United for a foul on Diafra Sakho.

On 11 May 2015, Fabiański kept a clean sheet and was named man of the match in a 1–0 win against Arsenal on his return to the Emirates Stadium. On 6 July, Fabiański signed a new four-year contract with Swansea, which would keep him at the club until June 2019.

Fabiański played all 38 of Swansea's Premier League games of 2017–18 and was voted Player of the Season by the club's supporters. His performances did not prevent the club from ending the season 18th and they were relegated to the Championship.

On 20 June 2018, Premier League club West Ham United announced the transfer of Fabiański for £7 million. He signed a three-year contract with the club. Fabiański, the first Pole to play first-team football for West Ham, was installed as first-choice 'keeper at the start of the 2018–19 season.

Having represented Poland regularly at under-21 level, Fabiański's performances for Legia Warsaw saw him soon making his debut for the senior international team in a friendly against Saudi Arabia on 29 March 2006.

Fabiański was included in Poland's squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, serving as back-up to Artur Boruc and Tomasz Kuszczak. During the qualifying campaign for the UEFA Euro 2008, he made one appearance, playing all 90 minutes in Poland's 2–2 away draw against Serbia on 21 November 2007. In September 2008, Fabiański replaced the suspended Boruc for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Slovenia. He also played in another qualifying match against San Marino in April 2009.

Despite going into UEFA Euro 2016 as an understudy to Wojciech Szczesny, an injury in the first game of the tournament led to Fabiański becoming first choice for the rest of the tournament. He went on to keep clean sheets in both of the remaining group games against World champions Germany and Ukraine. He then kept his place as Poland defeated Switzerland in the Round of 16 before losing to eventual winners Portugal on penalties.

Winston Reid

Winston Wiremu Reid (born 3 July 1988) is a New Zealand professional footballer who plays as a defender for English club West Ham United and also captains the New Zealand national team.

Both Reid's parents have Māori ancestry. He affiliates to Tainui through his father and to Te Rarawa through his mother. He was born in North Shore, Auckland, but moved from New Zealand to Denmark at the age of 10 with his mother and Danish stepfather. He always maintained contact with his father and his family in New Zealand.

Reid signed a youth contract with SUB Sønderborg, before moving on to play youth football with Danish Superliga club FC Midtjylland. He was one of the first players to graduate from FCM's football academy, the first of its kind in Denmark, coming through the system alongside Midtjylland teammates Jesper Weinkouff, Christian Sivebæk and former teammate, Simon Kjær. In November 2005, Reid signed a professional contract with FC Midtjylland. Aged 17, Reid made his FC Midtjylland debut in the Royal League tournament against Norwegian side Vålerenga in a 4–0 win. He made his league debut for FC Midtjylland coming on for David Nielsen as a substitute in the 78th minute. Playing few games in seasons 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2007–08 it was not until season 2008–09 that Reid made 28 appearances and scored his first goal against AaB Fodbold in a 3–2 loss on 23 March 2009 and scored his second in the league in his next match against AC Horsens in a 3–1 win on 5 April 2009. Reid also established himself in the starting eleven throughout the season until Reid left the club.

Reid signed for West Ham United on 5 August 2010, on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. His transfer fee was the subject of a dispute between West Ham United and FC Midtjylland as West Ham withheld the fee to bring to UEFA's attention fees owing to them from the sale of Alessandro Diamanti to Brescia. He made his Premier League debut on 14 August, in a 3–0 loss to Aston Villa, and scored his first goal for the club in a 5–1 win against Burnley in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup on 21 February 2011. In his first season for West Ham United Reid's first team opportunities were limited, making just 12 appearances in all competitions as the club was relegated.

For the 2011–2012 season Reid stayed at West Ham following relegation to the Championship, and scored his first league goal for West Ham United in a 4–1 away win over Nottingham Forest. Reid also scored the winning goal against arch-rivals Millwall in a 2–1 home win on 4 February 2012. West Ham finished the season by winning the Football League play-offs against Blackpool at Wembley Stadium, and gaining promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

In summer 2012, Reid opted to stay and train with his West Ham teammates ahead of the new Premier League season rather than represent New Zealand at the London Olympics. He scored his first ever Premier League goal in West Ham's 3–0 victory against Fulham on 1 September 2012, and in May 2013 Reid signed a two-year extension to his contact until the end of the 2014–15 season. Arguably his best season since joining the club, Reid was rewarded for his form on 8 May 2013 when he was named Hammer of the Year, as West Ham went on to finish the season in 10th.

Reid scored the opening goal in a 3–0 away win against rivals Tottenham Hotspur in October 2013. However, in November 2013 he suffered an ankle injury in training which required surgery. He made his return in February 2014 in a 2–0 home win against Swansea City. Reid made his 100th appearance for West Ham in all competitions on 15 April, in a 1–3 defeat away to Arsenal.

On 20 September, Reid scored the first goal after just two minutes in a 3–1 win against Liverpool at Upton Park. In March 2015, Reid signed a new six-and-a-half year contract with West Ham, after much speculation over his future at the club, after being linked with London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.

On 10 May 2016, Reid wrote his name into West Ham United folklore, when he scored the last ever goal at Upton Park in a 3–2 win against Manchester United.

Reid received Danish citizenship in 2006 and was subsequently called up for the under-19 national team. He played for various Danish age-grade representative teams, in particular the under-19s and under-21s, and played in the 2009 European Under-21 Championship qualification tournament.

On 11 March 2010, Reid stated that he wanted to play for the senior New Zealand team, and on 13 March 2010 he made himself available for New Zealand's 2010 World Cup selection. On 10 May 2010, Reid was included in New Zealand's 2010 World Cup squad even though New Zealand national coach Ricki Herbert had never seen him play. He made his international debut in a friendly against Australia in Melbourne two weeks later. His second appearance came in the All Whites' shock 1–0 victory over Serbia, leaving Ricki Herbert "suitably impressed" with Reid's performance, supplanting Ben Sigmund on the right side of Herbert's three-man defence.

On 15 June 2010, Reid scored an equalising goal in stoppage time against Slovakia in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup, thus securing a draw as well as his first ever international goal and New Zealand's first ever point in a World Cup finals match.

On 12 October 2010, Winston picked up his first international red card against Paraguay in Wellington for a "vicious" studs-up tackle on striker Federico Santander in the 90th minute of the All Whites' 2–0 defeat.

Following the retirement of Ryan Nelsen from international football in 2013, Winston Reid was named captain of the All Whites. On 7 November 2013, Reid was ruled out of the All Whites' FIFA World Cup playoff against Mexico, not only leaving a void on defense, but also with his successor as captain uncertain. As of December 2017, Reid has won 23 caps for his country.

Aaron Cresswell

Aaron William Cresswell (born 15 December 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back for Premier League club West Ham United and the English national team.

Cresswell made his first-team debut for Tranmere Rovers in 2008 and made 70 league appearances for the club before signing for Ipswich in 2011, following a tribunal to agree the value of the transfer. He made 138 appearances for Ipswich scoring six goals, before joining West Ham United in July 2014. He made his international debut for England in November 2016 in a friendly against Spain at Wembley Stadium.

Born in Liverpool, Merseyside, Cresswell started his career with Tranmere Rovers' youth system before signing his first professional contract in July 2008. He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2008 in a League One match with Milton Keynes Dons which ended in a 1–0 loss.

Although he was offered a new contract by the club at the end of the 2010–11 season, Tranmere manager Les Parry expected Cresswell to turn down the contract offer saying "Aaron has got four or five Championship clubs trying to sign him; if I had to guess I would say Aaron might be leaving us this summer."

In June 2011, the media reported that Ipswich Town had won the race to sign the player beating the likes of West Brom and Doncaster Rovers for his signature, although the clubs had failed to agree a fee and resolution of this was expected to go to a transfer tribunal. A three-year contract was later announced to have been signed.

In the summer of 2012, fine performances for Ipswich Town, where he won Supporters Player Of The Year Award, led the player to be linked with Premier League clubs such as Aston Villa.

On 3 July 2014, Cresswell joined West Ham United on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £3.75 million, plus add on clauses. He made his West Ham debut on 16 August 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. On 29 November he scored his first goal for the club, in the 1–0 victory over Newcastle United at the Boleyn Ground. In May 2015, Cresswell was named Hammer of the Year and Player's Player of the Year. Cresswell played all 38 league matches and all four FA Cup matches for West Ham in 2014–15. In June 2015, Cresswell signed a new contract which would keep him with West Ham until 2020, with the option for a further two years.

Cresswell made the highest number of appearances of any West Ham player in 2015–16, playing in 47 matches. He featured in 37 of the possible 38 Premier League matches scoring two goals, away to Aston Villa on 26 December, and at eventual champions Leicester City in a 2–2 draw on 17 April.

In July 2016, Cresswell was injured in a 3–0 pre-season victory over Karlsruher SC. Suffering a knee-ligament injury, Cresswell was initially expected to be out of action for four months. Cresswell recovered in time to make his return in West Ham's 1–0 victory away at Crystal Palace on 15 October, assisting Manuel Lanzini for the winning goal, however his comeback was cut short after he was sent-off for two yellow cards within a minute.

On 7 November 2016, Cresswell received his first international call-up to the England squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier with Scotland and a friendly with Spain, following Danny Drinkwater's withdrawal from the squad due to injury. He made his debut on 15 November, replacing Danny Rose in a 2–2 draw with Spain at Wembley Stadium.

Fabián Balbuena

Fabián Cornelio Balbuena González (born 23 August 1991) is a Paraguayan international footballer who plays as a centre back for English club West Ham United.

Born in Ciudad del Este, Balbuena was promoted to Cerro Porteño PF's first team in 2010, after the arrival of new manager Eduardo Rivera. He immediately became a starter under Rivera, playing in all the remaining seven matches of the campaign as his side achieved a mid-table position.

Balbuena quickly became a regular starter in 2011, being also team captain as the club achieved promotion from División intermedia. He scored his first goal for the club on 3 April of that year, netting the game's only in a home success over Deportivo Caaguazú.

Balbuena joined Rubio Ñu ahead of the 2013 season, but remained at the club for only six months before moving to defending champions Club Nacional. At the latter side, he was also first-choice and reached the 2014 Copa Libertadores Finals, losing it to San Lorenzo.

On 15 August 2014, Libertad bought 50% of Balbuena's federative rights, and the player signed a four-year deal with the club. Again a mainstay, he won the 2014 Clausura tournament.

On 16 February 2016, Balbuena moved abroad for the first time in his career after agreeing to a three-year deal with Série A side Corinthians. He made his debut for the club nine days later by starting in a 1–1 Campeonato Paulista away draw against São Bento, and scored his first goal on 19 March in a 4–0 home routing of Linense for the same competition.

A key defensive unit at "Timão", Balbuena lifted the 2017 Campeonato Paulista, 2017 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and 2018 Campeonato Paulista during his spell. On 24 April 2018, he signed a new four-year contract.

On 14 July 2018, Balbuena signed for Premier League club West Ham United on a three-year deal, for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 12 August in a 4–0 defeat by Liverpool. On 27 October he scored his first goal for the Hammers to open the scoring at Leicester City, but deflected Wilfred Ndidi's long-range shot into his own net for the equaliser; he was the first Paraguayan to score in England's top division since Antolín Alcaraz in May 2012.

First called up on 19 March 2015, Balbuena made his full international debut for Paraguay national team on 31 March by starting in a 1–0 friendly loss against Mexico at the Arrowhead Stadium. He was also named among the 23-man squads for the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario. He made his first competitive appearance at the latter in the final group game, a 1–0 loss to hosts the United States in which he was substituted at half time for attacker Juan Iturbe.

Pablo Zabaleta

Pablo Javier Zabaleta Girod (; born 16 January 1985) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a right-back for English club West Ham United and the Argentina national team. Zabaleta can operate on both sides of the pitch as a full-back and is known for his tenacious style of play, and has captained his club on numerous occasions.

With Manchester City, Zabaleta won all of English football's major honours: the FA Cup (2011), the Premier League (2012 and 2014), and the League Cup (2014 and 2016). Before joining Manchester City, Zabaleta played for La Liga club RCD Espanyol, where he won the 2005–06 Copa del Rey. He made 333 appearances over nine seasons for Manchester City before signing for London-based club West Ham United in the summer of 2017.

A full international since 2005, Zabaleta represented Argentina at the 2011 and 2015 Copa América, and was part of their team which finished as runners-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was also in their team which won gold at the 2008 Olympics.

Born in Buenos Aires, Zabaleta was raised in Arrecifes. He began his career at Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro in 2002 after progressing through their youth ranks, having been signed at the age of 12 from local club "Obras Sanitarias". He started playing as a defensive midfielder but eventually moved to the right side of midfield.

Zabaleta was transferred to Espanyol in 2005 for €3 million after being Argentina under-20s captain in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, which Argentina won. During the 2005–06 season, Zabaleta helped Espanyol to win the Copa del Rey, playing the full 90 minutes in the 4–1 defeat of Real Zaragoza in the final.

In January 2007, Zabaleta suffered a shoulder injury that kept him off the pitch for almost three months, already having established himself as an undisputed first team choice. Later in the season, he featured in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup final, where Espanyol lost on penalties to fellow Spanish side Sevilla.

In the summer of 2008, Zabaleta transferred to Premier League club Manchester City after rejecting an offer from Juventus. He stated upon joining that "the offer of Manchester City is impossible to reject." Having passed a medical and agreed personal terms, Zabaleta completed a five-year deal with City on 31 August 2008 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be the buy-out clause Zabaleta had attached to his contract of around £6.45 million. Zabaleta joined a day before Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by Sheikh Mansour, which enabled a wealth of investment in the club.

On 13 September 2008, Zabaleta made his debut for Manchester City in a 3–1 defeat to Chelsea at the City of Manchester Stadium. On 5 October, he received his first red card in English football when he was sent off in a 3–2 loss to Liverpool in his fourth Premier League appearance. He scored his first goal for City on 17 January 2009, the only goal of the game in a 1–0 league win over Wigan Athletic.

On 21 November 2010, Zabaleta scored his second Premier League goal in Manchester City's 4–1 win against Fulham. In the same match, he assisted a Carlos Tevez goal, helping his compatriot to earn his ninth goal for the club during the 2010–11 season.

On 1 January 2011, Zabaleta played his 100th game for Manchester City in all competitions, coming off the bench against Blackpool in a 1–0 win at Eastlands. Two weeks later, on 15 January, Zabaleta made his second assist of the season in a 4–3 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. This win meant that City went top of the league above local rivals Manchester United. However, City's title challenge faded with a loss of form in February and March 2011.

On 1 May 2011, Zabaleta scored his second goal of the season in a Premier League match against West Ham United. This secured a 2–1 win for the Citizens and put them seven points ahead of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in the race for fourth place.

On 14 May 2011, Zabaleta appeared as an 88th-minute substitute for Carlos Tevez in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Manchester City beat Stoke City 1–0.

In the summer of 2011, it was reported that Italian club Roma were keen on signing Zabaleta, but Manchester City insisted the player was not for sale and Zabaleta agreed a three-year contract in July 2011. On 1 October 2011, Zabaleta started and played the full 90 minutes at right-back in a 4–0 win over Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the Premier League, as regular starter Micah Richards was not available. On 23 October, he was an unused substitute in the convincing 1–6 win over rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford, with Richards starting at right-back.

In November 2011, Zabaleta extended his contract with City until the summer of 2015. Zabaleta said, "I'm in a very good team, and I try to do my best for the club, the team and the fans. I didn't think twice, I gave a quick answer because I was so happy to sign." In his first three-and-a-half years at the club, Zabaleta emerged as a cult hero amongst the Manchester City fans who admire his never-say-die attitude and commitment to the club.

On 30 April 2012, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the right-back slot in a 1–0 victory over rivals Manchester United thanks to a first-half stoppage time header by Vincent Kompany from a corner at the City of Manchester Stadium. Zabaleta scored the first goal in City's dramatic 3–2 win over Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season, a result which secured the first league title for the club since 1968. On 9 December 2012, Zabaleta scored a late equalising goal in a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.

On 1 January 2013, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win at the City of Manchester Stadium over Stoke City, doubling his goal tally from the previous season. On 25 January 2013, Zabaleta scored his third goal of the season and the only goal of the match in a 1–0 win away against Stoke City in the FA Cup, fourth round. His goal took Manchester City through to the fifth round.

Zabaleta was voted Manchester City's Player of the Month for both December 2012 and January 2013, and was stand-in captain for the club during Vincent Kompany's injury absence between January and March 2013. He was the only City player to be named in the 2012–13 Premier League PFA Team of the Year. After a superb season, Zabaleta was voted 2012–13 Manchester City Player of the Year.

Zabaleta was sent off in the 2013 FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic for a second yellow card after a clear foul on Callum McManaman 84 minutes into the match. Wigan went on to win 1–0 through a Ben Watson goal in stoppage time. He was the third player to be sent off in an FA Cup final and first for the losing side.

On 2 March 2014, Zabaleta played the full 90 minutes as Manchester City beat Sunderland 3–1 in the 2014 League Cup Final to complete a full set of major honours in English football. On 21 April, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 defeat of West Bromwich Albion at the City of Manchester Stadium. On 11 May, Zabaleta was part of the victory against West Ham that won Manchester City the Premier League, his second in three seasons.

On 21 September 2014, Zabaleta was sent off for a second yellow card due to a challenge on Chelsea's Diego Costa. Both players received a yellow card, Zabaleta for the initial challenge and Costa for his reaction.

On 21 August 2015, it was announced that Zabaleta was out for a month with knee injury. On 17 January 2016, Zabaleta reached 200 appearances for Manchester City in the club's 4–0 victory over Crystal Palace.

Zabaleta made 32 appearances in all competitions in the 2016–17 season scoring two goals; against Watford in the Premier League and against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. His final appearance for Manchester City came on 16 May 2017, a 3–1 home win against West Bromwich Albion. After the game he was praised by the City manager, Pep Guardiola, as a "legend". Zabaleta was given a lifetime season ticket for Manchester City and a shirt that read “Zabaleta 333”, to mark the number of City appearances he made.

On 26 May 2017, Zabaleta signed for Premier League club West Ham United on a free transfer, agreeing to a two-year contract. He was given number five as his squad number.

On 22 May 2018, Manuel Pellegrini was confirmed as manager of West Ham United, reuniting him with his former manager at Manchester City.

At the age of 14, Zabaleta was called up by Hugo Tocalli to the Argentina under-15 squad. He took part in many youth tournaments, including the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2003 and 2005, winning the latter in the Netherlands. He received over 75 caps to national youth sides, and started representing the senior side in 2005. He was also a member of the gold medal-winning team at the 2008 Summer Olympics, starting at right-back and playing all six matches.

After the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Zabaleta was not selected by head coach Diego Maradona, under the new Argentina manager he has established himself as first-choice right-back. On 1 June 2011, Zabaleta captained Argentina for the first time in a friendly against Nigeria.

In June 2014, Zabaleta was named in Argentina's squad for the 2014 World Cup. He made his World Cup debut in Argentina's 2–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Estádio do Maracanã, playing the full match in defence.

At the 2015 Copa América in Chile, Zabaleta sent in the cross from which his Manchester City teammate Sergio Agüero headed the only goal of the game as Argentina defeated holders Uruguay in their second group match.

Zabaleta was born in Buenos Aires, to a family of Basque descent. Zabaleta has a tattoo on his chest which bears the name of his mother.
In June 2018, he worked as a pundit for the BBC's Match of the Day 2018 World Cup coverage from Russia.

Marko Arnautović

Marko Arnautović (; , ; born 19 April 1989) is an Austrian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club West Ham United and the Austrian national team.

Arnautović began his career in his native Austria playing in the youth teams for a number of clubs in the Vienna area before he signed a contract with Dutch club Twente in 2006. He impressed at De Grolsch Veste and after a fine 2008–09 season he joined Italian giants Inter Milan on loan, where he made only three appearances due to injury. He joined German side Werder Bremen in June 2010 and became a regular member of the first team. In September 2013, Arnautović joined English side Stoke City. He spent four seasons in Stoke scoring 26 goals in 145 appearances. He joined West Ham United in July 2017 for a fee of £20 million.

A full international for Austria since 2008, he helped the nation to qualify for UEFA Euro 2016.

Arnautović was born in Floridsdorf, a district in the northern part of Vienna to a Serbian father and an Austrian mother.

Arnautović began his career with his brother Danijel at Floridsdorfer AC. In 1998, he joined FK Austria Wien but behaviour issues saw him change club regularly as in the next six years he played for First Vienna FC 1894, a second spell at FK Austria Wien, SK Rapid Wien before he returned to Floridsdorfer AC. Despite this he was scouted by Dutch club FC Twente who signed him in 2006.

Arnautović scored 22 goals in 24 matches for the Under-19 FC Twente in the 2007–08 season, helping them win the youth championship. He then played for Jong FC Twente between 2006 and 2008, appearing in 32 matches and scoring 27 goals. Arnautović made his professional debut for FC Twente in the 2006–07 season as a substitute for Kennedy Bakircioglu against PSV Eindhoven in April 2007. In July 2008, he extended his contract with Twente despite interest from Dutch giants Feyenoord.

He made 16 appearances in 2007–08 as Twente finished in fourth position and qualified for the UEFA Champions League. In the 2008–09 season Arnautović scored 14 goals in 41 matches as Twente finished 2nd in the Eredivisie and reached the knock out phase of the UEFA Cup. In March 2009 after a league match against Willem II, one of Twente opponents, Ibrahim Kargbo, accused Arnautović of racially abusing him. After an investigation by the Dutch Football Association they found no evidence against him and the case was dismissed.

On 4 August 2009, it was said that Arnautović was on the verge of a move to Italian giants Inter Milan. The deal had been largely held up due to a stress fracture in Arnautović's right foot, leading to a re-negotiation of the deal between the clubs. On 6 August, it was announced by Twente that the details for the loan had been finalised, Arnautović would join Inter on loan for the season. The deal was said to become permanent if he was to play a set number of matches. If the deal did not become permanent the player would return to Twente on a pre-agreed contract of two years, with an option to extend the contract for a third year. He made his unofficial debut for Inter in a friendly match on 5 September 2009 against Swiss team, Lugano, the final score was 3–3.

He made his league debut in a 1–0 away victory against Chievo on 6 January 2010. He played in their next match against Siena coming on as a substitute at half time for the injured Dejan Stanković and helped Inter to win the match 4–3. He played one more match for Inter against Atalanta on 24 April 2010. At the end of the season Inter decided against turning his loan in a permanent move and José Mourinho stated that Arnautović "is a fantastic person but has the attitude of a child".

On 4 June 2010, German Bundesliga club Werder Bremen confirmed that they had signed Arnautović from Twente on a four-year deal. Before he had played a match for Bremen he irked their captain Torsten Frings who branded him as "arrogant". He made his Bundesliga debut on 21 August 2010 in a 4–1 defeat against Hoffenheim. Arnautović scored twice against 1. FC Köln on 28 August 2010, his first goals for Bremen. He ended the 2010–11 season at the Weserstadion with five goals in 34 appearances as Bremen finished in 13th position and he also played in the Champions League. In 2011–12 he scored six goals in 20 appearances as Bremen finished in ninth position in the Bundesliga. In March 2012, he was ruled out for two months with a knee ligament injury he suffered whilst playing with his dog.

In 2012–13, Arnautović played in 27 matches and scored five goals which included a hat-trick on 2 December 2012 away at Hoffenheim, including an impressive free kick, as Bremen won 4–1. In April 2013, Arnautović and his Bremen teammate Eljero Elia were caught speeding and were both suspended by the club.

On 2 September 2013, Arnautović joined Premier League side Stoke City on a four-year contract for a fee of £2 million. He was assigned the number 10 shirt by manager Mark Hughes who also described his signing as a coup—"People will very quickly see what an outstanding talent he is. In terms of his power and his pace, which is something I think we need in the squad, he ticks all the boxes. Technically he's excellent and I'm really looking forward to working with him. I think it's quite a coup to get him here. It made sense to us and made sense to him that this is the right club for him. He's got a real desire to make an impression." Arnautović made his Stoke debut twelve days later in a 0–0 draw against Manchester City at the Bet365 Stadium. After spending a month at the club, manager Hughes stated that Arnautović had adapted well to English football after being give a free-role in the side. On 26 October, he scored his first goal for Stoke, a 25-yard free-kick in a 3–2 defeat against Manchester United. Arnautović ended his first season in England with five goals in 35 appearances, and the team finished in ninth position in the Premier League.

After making little impact in the first few matches of the 2014–15 season, Arnautović lost his place in the side. He regained his form towards the end of the campaign and returned to a regular place. He scored once in 29 league appearances over the campaign: a 95th-minute equaliser against West Ham United on 11 April 2015, having earlier in the match had two goals disallowed for offside. He played 35 times in 2014–15 season as Stoke finished in ninth position.

Arnautović's first appearance of the 2015–16 season came in a 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 15 August, scoring the team's first goal as they came back from 2–0 down. He scored the only goal of Stoke's victory over champions Chelsea on 7 November, and both goals against Manchester City on 5 December in a 2–0 home victory. On 28 December, Arnautović won a last-minute penalty kick against Everton at Goodison Park when he was fouled by John Stones, and sent it past goalkeeper Tim Howard to win the match 4–3. He scored the only goal of the League Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on 26 January 2016, forcing a penalty shootout which his team eventually lost. Arnautović went on to play 40 times for Stoke in 2015–16, finishing as the top scorer with 12 goals as the Potters again finished in ninth position.

Arnautović signed a new four-year contract with Stoke in July 2016, keeping him contracted with the Potters until the summer of 2020. Arnautović made 35 appearances in 2016–17, as Stoke finished in 13th position. He scored seven goals including braces against Sunderland and Middlesbrough.

Arnautović's future at Stoke was cast in doubt prior to the start of the 2017–18 season after he submitted a transfer request.

On 22 July 2017, Arnautović signed for fellow Premier League team West Ham United on a five-year contract for a club record £20 million fee, which could rise to £25 million with add-ons.

He made his debut on 13 August, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. In his next game six days later, he was sent off after 33 minutes for elbowing Southampton's Jack Stephens in a 3–2 away loss.

In November, new manager David Moyes said that Arnautović had to work harder and be more of a team player or be dropped. He scored his first goal for the club on 9 December, the only one of a win over reigning champions Chelsea at the London Stadium, in what was Moyes' first victory as West Ham manager. He followed this with a goal in his first return to the bet365 Stadium in a 0–3 win against Stoke City on 16 December. Following his conversion from a winger to a centre-forward at West Ham, Arnautović scored 11 Premier League goals in his first season at the club; his goal against Everton on the final day of the campaign making him the first West Ham player to reach that figure since Bobby Zamora in 2006–07. In April 2018, he was named as Hammer of the Year for the 2017–18 season. In January 2019, he was the subject of a £35m transfer offer from a Chinese club, believed to be Shanghai SIPG, which his agent and brother, Danijel, said Arnautović wanted West Ham to accept. Despite this, on 26 January, Arnautović committed himself to West Ham by signing a contract extension of unspecified length.

Arnautović played with the Austrian under-19 side in the 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Championship where he was sent-off in their second match and failed to make it out of the group stage. After scoring three goals in five matches for the Austria U21s, Arnautović earned praise from manager Andreas Herzog who described him the best Austrian footballer of 30 years.

Arnautović played his first match for the Austria national senior team on 11 October 2008 against the Faroe Islands. He scored his first goals for Austria in a 3–0 win over Azerbaijan on 8 October 2010.

Arnautović started in all ten of Austria's matches during their successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, scoring in a win over Montenegro and both fixtures against neighbours Liechtenstein.

Arnautović started all but one of Austria's qualification matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, only missing the game against the Republic of Ireland through suspension. He scored four goals in the 10 games, but Austria's fourth-place finish would not be enough for qualification.

Arnautović is an Orthodox Christian. He is married to Sarah (née Lizakowski), and together they have two daughters, Emilia and Alicia. During his time spent in Italy and Germany, Arnautović developed a bad reputation with the media and is viewed by them as "the bad boy of Austrian football". Speaking on the matter in October 2013, he admitted he is "not an angel" but insists the birth of his daughter has made him "grow up."

Felipe Anderson

Felipe Anderson Pereira Gomes (born 15 April 1993), known as Felipe Anderson, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for English club West Ham United and the Brazil national team.

Felipe Anderson was the youngest of five children in a poor family.

Felipe Anderson began his career in Associação 14 Companhia de Polícia Militar Independente (CPMIND), in his hometown of Santa Maria, Distrito Federal at 6 years old. In 2006, he was moved to Federal FC, and later to Sport Clube Recreativo Gaminha FC. After some impressive performances on the club, he was moved to Paraná to play for Astral EC, finishing the year. In 2007, he was moved to Coritiba youth side, and then in 2007 summer he was moved to Santos.

Felipe Anderson then played for Santos' youth categories, and was promoted to the senior squad following a rash of injuries in October 2010. He began training with the senior side and signed a professional contract until July 2013. He made his debut for Santos on 6 October 2010 as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–0 win against Fluminense.

His first goal of his footballing career came on 11 February 2011, when Felipe came off the bench at half time to replace Keirrison against Noroeste, scoring from a long range shot in the 70th minute. On 7 September, he scored his first league goal, against Avaí. In November, he signed a new contract with Santos, running until 2016.

In his following season, Felipe Anderson had more chances in first team alongside Neymar, due to Ganso's injuries and Elano's poor form (both players left Santos in the middle of the season). On 9 February 2012, he scored his first goal of the season, against Botafogo-SP.

On the 31 January 2013, the agreed transfer to the Italian club Lazio for €7.5 million failed due to late arrival of a necessary international fax from Brazil to close the deal.

On 25 June 2013, Lazio agreed a €7.8 million fee with Santos, and Felipe Anderson signed a five-year deal worth €800,000 a year. Santos received 50% of the transfer sum and the third part owner Doyen Sports would get the rest. Lazio's sporting director Igli Tare criticized the third part owner Doyen Sports for numerous times delaying the transfer, “It will remain in history as the most paradoxical and shocking negotiations I have ever been a part of,” said Tare. “These third party owners changed their minds continually. When we had everything decided, they would start from scratch two hours later. It all happened for a full week, so it felt like being in the Twilight Zone."

In his second season at the club, Felipe Anderson achieved 10 goals and nine assists in 27 games across all competitions by April 2015. This included the concluding goal as Lazio defeated Varese 3–0 in the fourth round of the season's Coppa Italia, and an assist in both legs of the tournament's semi-final against holders Napoli, the one in the second leg providing the winning goal by Senad Lulić. In March 2015, Felipe Anderson signed a contract extension at Lazio, renewing his contract until June 2020. He played the full 120 minutes of the Coppa Italia final on 20 May 2015, a 1–2 loss to Juventus.

In July, it was announced that Felipe Anderson would not be wearing the number 7 shirt that he had worn in his previous season with Lazio, but that he would instead be awarded the number 10 shirt. On 8 August, Felipe Anderson appeared in Lazio's 2–0 defeat to Juventus in the 2015 Supercoppa Italiana. On 23 September 2015, Felipe Anderson scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 victory against Genoa. After scoring the second goal in a 3–1 Europa League win against Rosenborg on 22 October 2015, Felipe Anderson scored twice in a 3–0 win against Torino three days later. In February 2016, Lazio publicly denied rumours that Manchester United had agreed a transfer for Felipe Anderson. Felipe Anderson finished Lazio's season with nine goals in all competitions, coming runner-up to Antonio Candreva in Lazio's scoring charts for the season.

After being the subject of reported interest from Chelsea during the summer, Felipe Anderson remained with Lazio. On 26 October 2016, Felipe Anderson scored his first goal of the season, in a 4–1 win against Cagliari. On 7 May 2017, Felipe Anderson scored a penalty in a 7–3 win against Sampdoria. Lazio secured qualification for the Europa League at the end of the season, with Felipe Anderson scoring five goals in all competitions.

During the 2017–18 season Felipe Anderson's form suffered numerous setbacks. A falling out with manager Simone Inzaghi after a 2–1 defeat to Genoa in February 2018 coupled with a knee injury that kept him out from August to December 2017 restricted Felipe Anderson to just nine Serie A starts for the season. On 20 May 2018, Felipe Anderson scored in his final game for Lazio in a 3–2 defeat to Inter Milan in a game that saw the victors qualify for the Champions League over Lazio.

On 15 July 2018, Felipe Anderson signed for West Ham United for a reported transfer fee of £36 million. The fee surpassed the previous record paid by the club, set with the £22 million signing of Issa Diop earlier in the same transfer window.
Felipe Anderson made his first appearance for West Ham in a 3–1 pre-season friendly victory against Aston Villa on 25 July 2018, in which he combined with Arthur Masuaku to set up West Ham's second goal of the match, scored by Marko Arnautović. He made his full debut on 12 August 2018 in a 4–0 defeat against Liverpool. On 29 September 2018, Felipe Anderson scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham with a back heeled finish in a 3–1 home win against Manchester United.

Felipe Anderson was one of seven stand-by players named by coach Dunga for Brazil's squad at the 2015 Copa América in Chile. He made his debut in a warm-up match against Mexico on 7 June of that year, playing the final seven minutes in place of Fred in a 2–0 victory at Allianz Parque in São Paulo.

In June 2016, Felipe Anderson was included in Brazil's squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics on home soil by the Olympic side's manager Rogério Micale. On 20 August, he appeared in the final of the tournament against Germany at the Maracanã in Rio; Brazil won the match 5–4 on penalties following a 1–1 draw to capture its first Olympic gold medal in men's football.
Anderson was recalled to the Brazil squad in February 2019, for the first time since 2015, for two friendly matches.

A quick, well-rounded, and technically gifted midfielder, with a slender and diminutive but long-limbed physique, Felipe Anderson is considered a promising and talented young player. He is predominantly known for his pace, and is regarded as one of the fastest players in the modern game; although not imposing physically or in the air, he also possesses good ball control, quick feet, and excellent dribbling skills, which allow him to beat opponents in one on one situations. A tactically versatile player, he is capable of playing in several different positions due to his wide range of skills, high work-rate, and ability to both create and score goals: he has been used as a forward or as a central midfield playmaker, but has most frequently been deployed as either a winger or an attacking midfielder, due to his offensive movement and tendency to operate between the lines; he is capable of playing on either flank or through the centre of the pitch, due to his ability to cut into the middle and strike on goal, or move out to the wing to provide accurate crosses to teammates in the area. In addition to his speed, stamina, creativity and technical ability, he is known for his eye for goal, and is gifted with a powerful and accurate shot from distance with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed; he is also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker. He can also serve as an assist-man due to his creative ability, vision, dead-ball delivery, and eye for the final pass.

Andy Carroll

Andrew Thomas Carroll (born 6 January 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for club West Ham United and the English national team.

Carroll started his professional career with Newcastle United in 2006, before spending a brief period on loan with Preston North End, during which time he scored his first league goal. He established himself as a regular in the Newcastle first team by 2008, and following Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League to the Championship in 2009, scored 17 goals in 39 appearances to help Newcastle finish first in the league, earning immediate promotion back to the Premier League in the process. He continued to play for Newcastle in the Premier League, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances.

Carroll signed for Liverpool on the last day of the transfer window on 31 January 2011 for a fee of £35 million, at the time the highest amount paid for a British footballer. Carroll was bought to replace Fernando Torres, who moved from Liverpool to Chelsea on the same day for a fee of £50 million. An injury sustained in December delayed his Liverpool debut until March 2011, and he scored his first two goals for his new club in April 2011 in a 3–0 victory over Manchester City. In August 2012, Liverpool agreed a £2 million loan deal that would see Carroll spend a season-long loan at West Ham. This move was made permanent in June 2013 for a fee of £15 million.

Between 2010 and 2012, Carroll played nine matches for England, scoring twice, including one goal at UEFA Euro 2012.

Carroll, an occasional scorer in Newcastle United's reserve team, signed his first professional contract with the club in July 2006. He made his first-team debut on 2 November 2006 at the age of 17 years and 300 days in a 1–0 UEFA Cup win over Palermo, coming on as a late substitute for Nolberto Solano. In doing so, he became the youngest ever player to represent Newcastle in Europe.

He made his FA Cup debut on 17 January 2007, appearing as substitute for the last ten minutes in the 5–1 home defeat by Birmingham City. On 25 February 2007, Carroll made his Premier League debut for Newcastle, coming on as a substitute in the 87th minute in the 1–0 defeat by Wigan Athletic, almost scoring in the process; only a good save from Wigan goalkeeper John Filan prevented him from scoring his first Newcastle goal.

In 2007, he was the recipient of the Wor Jackie Milburn Trophy, awarded every year to the rising star of North-East football, chosen from among Newcastle players.

On 29 July 2007, Carroll scored his first senior goal with a left foot shot in a 2–0 win over Juventus in a friendly match. After the match, Carroll received praise from Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who tipped Carroll to have a big future.

On 14 August 2007, Carroll began a six-month loan with Preston North End, and made his debut for them in the League Cup against Morecambe on the same day. Carroll was sent off playing for Preston against Scunthorpe United on 18 September. He scored his first Championship goal, and his first English league goal, against Leicester City on 6 November.

Carroll made his first appearance for Newcastle in the 2008–09 season on 20 October, coming on as a substitute for Shola Ameobi at home to Manchester City. Carroll scored his first competitive goal for Newcastle on his first ever home start with a header against West Ham United in a 2–2 draw on 10 January 2009. He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract on 12 March 2009, in theory keeping him at Newcastle until 2012.

Following Newcastle's relegation, and the departures of first-team strikers, Michael Owen, Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins, Carroll was paired with Shola Ameobi in attack for Newcastle at the start of the new season. His first league goal in the Championship came on 16 September 2009 against Blackpool with a header. By 2010, Carroll was playing almost every match, in a new strike partnership with Peter Løvenkrands. This partnership accounted for more than half of the club's goals in 2010. Carroll finished the season as Newcastle's top scorer, with 19 goals in all competitions, 17 in the league.

Carroll was given squad number 9 for the 2010–11 season, a number with great significance for Newcastle United supporters, as it has been worn in the past for Newcastle by the likes of Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald and Alan Shearer. Carroll scored his first career hat-trick against Aston Villa in their 6–0 win in the Premier League on 22 August 2010. Carroll captained Newcastle for the first time on 3 October 2010 when he came on as a substitute for Kevin Nolan against Manchester City. In October 2010, Carroll signed a new five-year contract, on paper keeping him at the club until 2015. Carroll scored Newcastle's third in a 3–1 victory over Liverpool at St James' Park on 11 December 2010, with a low 25-yard drive.

On 31 January 2011, Liverpool put in a bid of £30 million for Carroll, which was rejected. Newcastle then accepted a bid of £35 million and, following the agreement of personal terms and a medical, the transfer was completed shortly before the 11:00 pm deadline.

Carroll insisted he was forced out of Newcastle, but United claimed he had handed in a transfer request after they turned down Liverpool's £30 million bid. Liverpool confirmed that Carroll would wear the number 9 jersey previously worn by Fernando Torres, who left Anfield for Chelsea on the same evening for £50 million. The transfer made Carroll the eighth overall most expensive footballer at the time, and also the most expensive British footballer of all time. He also became the second most expensive footballer playing for a British club, after Torres. Due to an injury that was sustained while with Newcastle, however, it was announced that Carroll would have to wait some time before his Liverpool debut.

Carroll finally made his Liverpool debut as a substitute in the 3–1 win against Manchester United on 6 March 2011. On 10 March, he appeared in his first European match for Liverpool in a 1–0 loss at Braga in the UEFA Europa League, appearing as a substitute after half-time. In the return leg a week later, he made his first Liverpool start, although the match finished 0–0, leading to Liverpool going out of the competition losing 1–0 on aggregate. On 20 March, he made his first Premier League start for Liverpool at the Stadium of Light in a 2–0 victory against Sunderland. On 11 April, Carroll scored his first goals for Liverpool in a 3–0 victory against Manchester City at Anfield, scoring his first with a long-range strike and his second with a header. He played several more times that season, but did not score any more goals.

On 24 August 2011, he scored his first goal of the new season with a 20-yard drive against Exeter City to make the score 3–0 in the second round of the League Cup. On 1 October 2011, he scored his first league goal of the 2011–12 season during a 2–0 victory over Everton at Goodison Park. His third goal of the season came in a 2–0 win away at West Bromwich Albion. He scored his first goal of 2012 in a 5–1 third-round FA Cup victory against Oldham Athletic. He would go on to create the Dirk Kuyt goal that would secure victory in the 88th minute over Manchester United in the fourth round of the FA Cup on 28 January, before marking the first anniversary of his signing with Liverpool with his fifth goal of the season in a 3–0 victory away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 31 January. He later scored, and set up teammate Luis Suárez, during Liverpool's 6–1 thrashing of Brighton & Hove Albion in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

On 26 February, he won his first trophy with Liverpool as they won the League Cup, beating Cardiff City in the final. On 10 April, he headed an injury-time winner against Blackburn Rovers to end Liverpool's run of four matches without a win. Four days later, he headed in another late winner, this time in a 2–1 victory against Everton in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, to take Liverpool through to the final on his 50th appearance for Liverpool. Carroll described his match-winning goal as "the best feeling ever", with teammate Jamie Carragher saying the goal was "worth £35 million in itself" and that Carroll would "be remembered forever". He also scored in the final, which Liverpool lost 2–1 to Chelsea.

On 30 August 2012, it was agreed that Carroll would spend the 2012–13 season on loan to fellow Premier League club West Ham United, who were newly promoted to the division at the time.

On 30 August 2012, Carroll signed with West Ham on a season-long loan. Liverpool initially wanted a £17 million option for a permanent transfer written into the loan deal, but dropped the demand to facilitate the deal, and West Ham ultimately paid a £2 million loan arrangement fee and also all of Carroll's £80,000-a-week Liverpool wages.

Carroll made his debut on 1 September, setting-up two goals in a 3–0 home win against Fulham. He scored his first goal on 25 November 2012 in a 3–1 away defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. After making his first start since November due to injury, Carroll scored the only goal in a home win against Swansea City on 2 February 2013. Carroll ended the loan spell with seven goals in 24 appearances.

On 21 May 2013, West Ham and Liverpool agreed a fee of around £15 million to make the loan move permanent, pending Carroll agreeing to the move, and then to personal terms. Carroll signed a six-year contract with West Ham on 19 June 2013 for a then club record transfer fee of £15 million.

Carroll started the 2013–14 season injured with a heel problem picked up in the final match of the previous season. He made his first appearance of the season on 12 January 2014, as a substitute in the 72nd minute of a 2–0 victory over Cardiff, assisting Mark Noble for West Ham's second goal. On 31 March, he was named man of the match by Sky Sports for his performance in a 2–1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in which he scored one and assisted the other of the Hammers' goals. Carroll ended the 2013–14 Premier League season with two goals from 18 appearances.

During a pre-season tour of New Zealand, Carroll sustained an ankle ligament injury which prevented him from appearing during West Ham's first eleven Premier League matches. Carroll returned to the team on 8 November 2014, coming on as a substitute for Mark Noble in a 0–0 home draw with Aston Villa.

On 7 December 2014, he scored his first two goals of the season against Swansea in a 3–1 home win; these were also his first goals scored at Upton Park since March 2013. On 20 December, Carroll scored the 50th league goal of his career in West Ham's 2–0 defeat of Leicester. From December 2014 to January 2015, he went on a run of five goals in eight league appearances.

On 11 February 2015, Carroll was substituted in the second half of a 0–0 draw against Southampton with a tear in his medial ligament on the side of his knee. Two days later, West Ham's website announced Carroll was set to have surgery the following week and expected to miss the remainder of the 2014–15 season. He did not play again after February and made only 14 league appearances in the 2014–15 season, scoring five goals; three against Swansea City and one each against Hull City and Leicester.

Carroll returned to the first team on 14 September 2015, making his first appearance of the season as an 88th-minute substitute for Victor Moses in a 2–0 home win against his former club, Newcastle.

On 24 October, Carroll scored his first goal in nine months, coming on as a substitute and heading in Aaron Cresswell's cross to defeat champions Chelsea 2–1 in a Premier League fixture at Upton Park. Following several goalless matches, Carroll suffered a groin injury while training for West Ham's 7 December match against Swansea, sidelining him for several weeks. He returned to action as a half-time substitute in a 2–1 win against Southampton. Carroll scored the winning goal via header after a shot from Michail Antonio had rebounded off of the crossbar. This marked Carroll's first goal since the match against Chelsea, and just his third of the year.

On 2 January 2016, Carroll started for West Ham against his former club Liverpool, in a 2–0 victory with Carroll scoring again from a header following a cross from Mark Noble. This was the first time Carroll had scored in consecutive matches in nearly 12 months, and was his first goal against Liverpool since leaving the club in 2013. On 9 April, Carroll scored his first hat-trick with West Ham, in a 3–3 draw against Arsenal.
On 20 April, Carroll scored in his third consecutive Premier League match for the first time in his career as West Ham beat Watford 3–1 at the Boleyn Ground.

Carroll played the full 90 minutes in West Ham's 2–1 defeat against Chelsea in the first match of the season, on 15 August. On 18 August, Carroll came on at the 63rd minute in a 1–1 draw against Astra Giurgiu in the first leg of the Europa League playoffs, and sustained a knee injury. While initial estimates put his recovery time at six weeks, it saw him sidelined for over three months.

On 3 December, he returned to action, scoring as a 73rd-minute substitute in a 1–5 home loss against Arsenal. On 14 January 2017, Carroll scored what he admitted to be "The best goal he's ever scored" with a bicycle kick in a 3–0 win against Crystal Palace at London Stadium. The goal was named Goal of the Month for January by the Premier League on 10 February.

On 1 April, Carroll scored the 50th Premier League goal of his career in a 2–1 loss at Hull City, captaining West Ham for the first time.

On 11 September 2007, Carroll made his England under-19 debut against Belarus, scoring in the 4–0 victory. On 12 March 2009, Carroll was called up to the England under-20s for a match against Italy, but was withdrawn from the squad and replaced by Hal Robson-Kanu.

Carroll received his first call up to the England under-21s on 5 August 2009. He made his debut on 11 August 2009 against the Netherlands, coming on as a second-half substitute. On his second cap with the under-21 team, on 9 October 2009 against Macedonia, he scored two goals and assisted another as England won 6–3.

Carroll's performances for Newcastle United earned him a call up to the England squad for the friendly against France on 17 November 2010. Carroll passed a late fitness test to start the match.
Carroll scored his first senior goal, a low left foot drive into the bottom corner, for England on 29 March 2011 in a friendly against Ghana which ended 1–1. On 15 May 2012, Carroll was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2012. He opened the scoring for England with a powerful header in their second group match against Sweden, which England went on to win 3–2.

Carroll has been compared to Newcastle's record goalscorer Alan Shearer, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba and former Italy forward Christian Vieri. He has also been referred to as a classic centre forward, owing to his strength, powerful shot and excellent heading ability. Former Newcastle manager and Liverpool player Kevin Keegan stated "he is probably in the top three headers of a ball I have ever seen in football". After Newcastle's 2–0 victory at home to Blackpool in September 2010, in which Carroll scored the second goal and was instrumental in creating the first, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway described Carroll as "the best striker in the Premier League". A strong and very physical centre-forward, Carroll is distinguished by his powerful aerial abilities, with former West Ham manager Slaven Bilić claiming that he is "the best in the world at heading a football".

Born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, Carroll attended Brighton Avenue Primary School and Joseph Swan School.
He is a model for retail clothing company H&M and has fronted a campaign led by fashion designer Alexander Wang. In November 2014, Carroll became engaged to reality TV star Billi Mucklow. The couple live in Essex. Their son, Arlo, was born in June 2015. He has two children, Emilie Rose and Lucas, from a previous relationship. In November 2017, Mucklow and Carroll had a second child, Wolf Nine.

In November 2016, Carroll was approached by two men on motorcycles while driving near his home in Brentwood, Essex. Armed with a hand gun, they attempted to steal his £22,000 watch but failed. Carroll was then chased in his car for about 20 minutes as he drove back to West Ham's training ground in Rush Green to get help from security staff. In September 2017, 22-year-old Jack O'Brien was found guilty of the attempted robbery.
He was sentenced to six years in prison for the offence.

Carroll has been involved in many off-the-pitch incidents in his career. On 14 September 2008, he was arrested by police in Newcastle, and later accepted a police caution.

On 7 December 2009, he was arrested in the aftermath of a nightclub fight, again in Newcastle, accused of smashing glass in a man's face. He was charged with assault and in October 2010 he pleaded guilty to common assault and was fined £1,000. He was also ordered to pay £2,500 compensation.

While on international duty with the England U-19s, Carroll and teammates Scott Sinclair and Ryan Bertrand were sent home from the squad after breaking a curfew on 14 October 2007 during preparation for a match against Romania U-19s.

In March 2010, Carroll was allegedly involved in an altercation with teammate Steven Taylor during training that left Taylor with a broken jaw. Carroll reportedly suffered a broken hand in the incident, and shortly afterwards he was photographed at a pop concert with bandages to both hands. Then Newcastle manager Chris Hughton, club representatives and both players declined to comment any further on the incident and no charges were pressed.

On 18 October 2010, Carroll was charged with assault in an incident with his ex-girlfriend. Claiming self-defence, and having given a local hotel as his address, Carroll was granted bail on the condition that he resided with then Newcastle captain Kevin Nolan until the case resumed in January. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. Two days following his bail, Carroll's car was set on fire while parked on Nolan's driveway, with the club captain's garage door also being daubed with obscenities.

Following England's 1–1 draw with Ghana on 29 March 2011, England manager Fabio Capello told Carroll to curtail his drinking habits. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish responded by saying, "Well he's never bought me a drink. I've been with him at Boyzone concerts and he's still never bought me a drink!"

In an interview in April 2012, Carroll admitted that he had gained a reputation for drinking and socialising during his time at Newcastle, but that since joining Liverpool in January 2011 he had "settled down" and changed his lifestyle.

Carroll's time at West Ham United has been blighted by many injuries. His former manager, Sam Allardyce claimed this was partly caused by Carroll failing to look after himself and not doing the required rehabilitation work to keep himself fit.

Manuel Lanzini

Manuel Lanzini (; born 15 February 1993) is an Argentine footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for English club West Ham United and the Argentina national team. He has previously played for River Plate and Fluminense. He is described as possessing phenomenal dribbling ability, as well as fantastic acceleration and vision and the ability to ghost past defenders. He is nicknamed "La Joya" ("the jewel").

He currently holds the record of being the player that scored the earliest goal in the history of Argentina's derby, the Superclásico, scoring only 43 seconds after the beginning of the match.

He stood out in indoor soccer football divisions, demonstrating his capabilities in the class of 1993 of the Club Academia Kaly de Ituzaingó, a neighbourhood club. Ramón Maddoni, who discovered players like Juan Román Riquelme, Carlos Tévez and Esteban Cambiasso, wanted to take him to Boca Juniors for a test match but the young Lanzini firmly declined the call, stating that he only aimed to play for the club that he supported: Club Atlético River Plate. He was finally taken to River Plate, in 2002. He began playing as a playmaker in junior divisions. Lanzini began training in River and, after several tests, Pedro Vega, ex player and coach of inferior divisions from the club, ordered to hire him. In 2008 the 8th division team of which he was a part of won the trophy for that division, with a personal mark of 9 goals, only 2 less than Leonardo Salguero, who was his companion in attack and top scorer of the team with 11 goals. On 2 November 2008, River Plate won the junior division's Superclásico 3–0 to Boca Juniors with Lanzini scoring 2 goals and assisting the mentioned Salguero in other.

In 2010, the coach of River Plate's first team Ángel Cappa, included him in the team for the winter preseason, disputing several matches in Salta Province. He then made his informal debut in a friendly match against Central Norte, a 3–0 victory, coming on as a second-half substitute for Ariel Ortega. He then played another friendly match against Juventud Antoniana, in which his performance obtained a very good reception from the press and fans alike.

The mentioned performances in 2010 winter's preseason satisfied the coach. Finally he made his first appearance on 8 August 2010, against Tigre for the first match of the Torneo Apertura 2010. River won 1–0 and Lanzini was replaced at half time by Facundo Affranchino.

This appearance made him one of the youngest players to make their debut in the First Division for River Plate, being only 17 years, 5 months and 24 days old, only after Daniel Villalva, legend Adolfo Pedernera and the ex-Barcelona and Real Madrid player Javier Saviola.
After his debut, coach Ángel Cappa did not include him in the match against Huracán. Nevertheless, he played the next match against Independiente in place of suspended Ariel Ortega. In that match he made an assist that allowed his teammate Rogelio Funes Mori to score the goal for the 3–2 victory, rounding out a strong performance. 5 September, during the match River lost against Vélez Sársfield, he suffered from an injury after a strong tackle from Leandro Somoza, which ruled him out for three weeks. He made his comeback to the first team on the 12 match of the season.

19 July 2011 an agreement was reached between River Plate and Fluminense, with the latter taking the player on loan for a fee of US$400,000, with a transfer option of €15,000,000.

He made his debut in the 3–0 victory against Figueirense for the 16th date of the Brasileirao 2011. He would then score his first official goal in the team's victory 2–1 against São Paulo for the 20th date of that tournament. His performances and character made the president of the club label him "The new Neymar". His most important goal for the club was against Flamengo in the Río de Janeiro Fla-Flu derby.

Despite his good performances, Fluminense was unable to retain the player and after the loan he had to come back to River Plate.

He came back to River Plate 30 June 2012. He jumped to the pitch as a starter on the team's first appearance in the tournament, scoring the team's only goal in the 1–2 loss against Belgrano de Córdoba. For his comeback, he asked to use the club's iconic number 10 shirt to the coach Matías Almeyda, who allowed the player to do so. Nevertheless, during Almeyda's leadership Lanzini was not able to assure himself a place in the pitch, sometimes watching the matches from the bench or not forming part of the main team.

Almeyda was finally fired and the club's most successful coach to that date, ex Inter Milan player Ramón Díaz was appointed as team manager. With him, Lanzini's chance of regaining a place as a starter increased. Coach made a strong bet on Lanzini, putting him as a starter in the team's 2–0 victory against San Martín (SJ) and Manu corresponded scoring one of the two goals. He was then considered a regular starter for the team.
During the 12th date of the Torneo Final 2013 tournament, he was able to score his first goal in the Superclásico, one of the most heated football rivalries in the world, in the 1–1 draw against Boca Juniors; this goal, as of 2018, stands out as the fastest goal in the derby's history (43 seconds). River would end up in 2nd place in the Torneo Final of the season.

During the preseason facing the Torneo Final from the 2013 season, the club received an offer from the Baniyas from United Arab Emirates, but the player turned down the offer because, citing his own father, he considered to prioritize his professional sporting career over economic opportunities. He remained one of the team highlights in both Torneo Inicial 2013 and international cup Copa Sudamericana 2013 during that year, but the overall form of the team was inconsistent and thus River Plate did not win any trophies in that year.

Things would be different for the club in 2014. That year proved to be one of the most memorable year's in club's history, winning the Torneo Final 2014 and the Copa Sudamericana 2014 kicking out Boca Juniors from that international competition. Lanzini remained half of the year as part of the team, so he was part of the Torneo Inicial 2014 trophy; during that time he continued to be one of the most important players in the pitch. He had the honor to once again score a goal in the team's victory in the 2014 Superclásico against Boca Juniors, the so-called "Bombonerazo" which began a series of crushing victories of River Plate over Boca Juniors. This match stood out in particular because it was the one that definitively launched the career of his teammate Ramiro Funes Mori, a defender who scored a header in the last minutes of the match; he would end up also playing in the Premier League, as Lanzini, for Everton FC. River Plate would end up being Torneo Final 2014 champion, with a very solid performance from Manu, who scored 2 goals in 18 appearances.

Prior to the beginning of local 2014 Torneo de Transición Championship and international Copa Sudamericana 2014, 6 August 2014 he transferred to the Al-Jazira Club of the UAE Pro-League, for US$6.000.000, with a salary amounting to US$12.000.000 in 3 years.

In 2014 Lanzini became the youngest foreign player, at 21, to play in the UAE Arabian Gulf League when he signed a four-year deal for Al Jazira Club. He had been courted by clubs in England, Spain, Italy and Turkey, and was signed as a replacement for Marseille-bound Abdelaziz Barrada.

On 22 July 2015, Lanzini signed for Premier League side West Ham United on a season-long loan, with an option to make the move permanent. He made his debut on 6 August in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round away to Astra Giurgiu, starting the match and scoring in the third minute, however the Hammers lost 2–1 (4–3 on aggregate) and were eliminated. His league debut came on 15 August as a 76th-minute substitute for Cheikhou Kouyaté in a 1–2 home defeat to Leicester City. On 29 August, he scored his first league goal after just three minutes away to Liverpool, and assisted a Mark Noble goal as the Hammers won 3–0 for their first victory at Anfield since 1963. In March 2016, West Ham confirmed that they had taken up the option to sign Lanzini on a permanent deal, with effect from 1 July 2016.

Lanzini played 39 games in all competitions for West Ham, scoring eight goals. On 15 October 2016 he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win away to Crystal Palace to give West Ham their first away win on the season. His goal in a 1–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur on 5 May 2017 halted Tottenham's challenge to win the Premier League title. Tottenham, at the time, were on a nine-match winning run and were challenging Chelsea for the league title. On 9 May he was voted runner-up to Michail Antonio as Hammer of the Year and the Players’ Player of the Year.

Lanzini made his first appearance of the season on 26 August 2017, in a 3–0 defeat away at Newcastle United. In the same game, Lanzini was caught with an elbow by Aleksandar Mitrović, who was later banned for three games as a result of the incident. Lanzini scored his first goal of the season in a 1–4 defeat at home to Liverpool on 4 November 2017, before adding a further two goals to his tally on 13 January 2018 in a 4–1 away win at Huddersfield Town. On 13 May, he scored twice in a 3–1 win over Everton, on the final day of the season.

After being sidelined due to injury since May 2018, Lanzini made his first appearance of the season on 22 February 2019, coming on as a 76th minute substitute for Felipe Anderson in a 3–1 home win against Fulham F.C..

In May 2016, Lanzini was named in Argentina's provisional 35-man squad for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He withdrew from the squad in July 2016 following a knee injury sustained while training in Miami, Florida, returning to London for treatment with West Ham United. In May 2017 Lanzini was named in new Argentina manager Jorge Sampaoli’s first squad for the upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Singapore, with Lanzini making his full international debut on 9 June against Brazil at the MCG in Melbourne, Australia, replacing Ever Banega in the 81st minute of "La Albiceleste"'s 1–0 win. On 23 March 2018 he played a friendly match against Italy at Etihad Stadium in Manchester and scored his first international goal, as Argentina secured a 2–0 victory.

On 21 May 2018 he was named in Argentina’s final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and started in the 4–0 friendly win against Haiti on 29 May in Buenos Aires, playing an hour before being substituted for Maximiliano Meza. On 8 June 2018, Lanzini was ruled out of the World Cup after suffering a ruptured anterior knee ligament injury during the training session.

Lanzini was born in the Greater Buenos Aires, in Ituzaingó, and raised in San Antonio de Padua. He also holds an Italian passport.
His father, Héctor, played for Sporting Cristal and Deportivo Morón, while his brother Tomás has played for Ñublense and Brown de Adrogué.
He is outspoken about his support of River Plate, celebrating club victories on social media, and has a tattoo of himself with the River Plate shirt on.

Robert Snodgrass

Robert Snodgrass (born 7 September 1987) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club West Ham United and the Scotland national team. He can also play as a forward.

Snodgrass started his senior career with Livingston. He also had a loan spell at Stirling Albion before moving to England in 2008, joining Leeds United. He helped Leeds win promotion to the Championship in 2010. In February 2012, Snodgrass was appointed captain of Leeds, but he rejected a new contract offer and moved to Norwich City in July. He left Norwich after they were relegated in 2014 and moved to Hull City. On his league debut for Hull, Snodgrass suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for over a year. Hull were relegated in his absence, but Snodgrass helped them gain promotion via the playoffs in 2016. Snodgrass moved to West Ham United in January 2017.

After playing for Scotland at various youth levels including under-21s, Snodgrass received a call up to the Scotland national team side in 2009, and won his first cap in February 2011.

Born in Glasgow, Snodgrass grew up in the city's Gallowgate area; he played boys club football for a team affiliated with Rangers alongside future international teammate James McArthur who is a month younger and lived a few blocks away. Celtic offered him an apprenticeship, along with Clyde and Livingston. He felt that he had little chance of breaking through at Parkhead, so chose Livingston, joining their setup at the same time as another East End boy who would go on to play for Scotland, Graham Dorrans.

Snodgrass started his career at Livingston, where he scored 15 goals in 79 league games. He caught attention by turning down a trial with Spanish giants Barcelona. Before he turned professional, he was offered a move to Blackburn Rovers, though he chose to stay with Livingston. After recovering from a broken metatarsal, he moved to Stirling Albion on loan for the remainder of the 2006–07 season on 30 January 2007 to step up his recovery from injury.

Snodgrass established himself as a regular first-team member during the 2005–06 season. This was a campaign of mixed fortunes, as he gained regular first-team football, yet his side were relegated to Division 1. During Livingston's first season in the second tier, he scored ten goals for Livingston in the Scottish First Division during the 2007–08 season; he was offered a new contract at Livingston, but turned it down. After failing to impress during a trial spell with Barnsley, he joined League One team Leeds United in July 2008. He left the Lions scoring 15 goals in 79 games.

After joining Leeds, Snodgrass came into the side for the first game of the season to make his debut against Scunthorpe United, gaining an assist after setting up Enoch Showunmi's headed goal. He scored his first goal for Leeds in the 5–2 League Cup victory over Chester City. After initially struggling to hold a regular place in the starting line-up, Snodgrass established himself after a string of impressive performances throughout November and December, which saw the young winger score four goals in seven games during a poor run of form for the Yorkshire club, culminating in the sacking of manager Gary McAllister.

Leeds reached the playoffs but ultimately were knocked out of the competition after losing 2–1 on aggregate to Millwall. He was the top assist maker in the division with 16, despite only playing regular first team football from December onwards. In his first season at Leeds, he scored 11 goals and got 19 assists.

On the eve of the season, Snodgrass signed a new four-year contract with the club. Snodgrass made a slow start to the season, but chipped in with two assists, one against Darlington in the League Cup, and the other against Wycombe Wanderers. He bagged his first goals of the season with two against Watford in the League Cup second round, sending Leeds through to the third round.

Snodgrass scored a late winner against Milton Keynes Dons in a 1–0 win for Leeds for his first league goal of the season.

In May 2010, he was selected in the League One PFA Team of the Year for the 2009–10 season. Snodgrass played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to The Championship after finishing in second place in League One and thus earning automatic promotion. In his second season Snodgrass scored 10 goals in total and gained 14 assists.

On 27 July 2010, Snodgrass was believed to have suffered a serious knee injury during the pre-season game away to Norwegian team Brann after falling victim to a horrendous challenge by David Nielsen. The knee injury ruled him out of the rest of the pre-season campaign, but after two scans on the injured knee, the injury was not as serious as first feared, but kept Snodgrass out for several weeks. Manager Simon Grayson claimed that no exact timescale had been put on Snodgrass' recovery from injury. Snodgrass returned to training at the start of September 2010. To help gain match fitness after his injury, Snodgrass played 90 minutes in a closed-doors friendly against Middlesbrough. Snodgrass returned to Leeds' squad after injury when he was named on the bench the game against Doncaster Rovers, he came on as a second-half substitute replacing Ross McCormack.

Snodgrass came on as a second-half substitute against Sheffield United and managed to assist Leeds' late winner for Bradley Johnson, however his game ended on a sour note when he was sent off for two yellow cards. Snodgrass returned from suspension for Leeds against Ipswich Town, replacing Luciano Becchio in the starting lineup and scored his first goal of the season. He scored his second goal of the season with a curled effort against Coventry City. His performance against Coventry was welcomed as a return to form by Snodgrass. His third goal of the season came against Leicester City with a long-range effort.

On 1 January 2011, Snodgrass was injured in the 1–1 draw with Middlesbrough, where he was kicked once in the back as well as being stamped on the calf muscle. He scored against Cardiff City with another long range goal. On 8 January 2011, Snodgrass scored with a second half penalty in a 1–1 FA Cup draw with Arsenal. He scored his sixth goal of the season on 1 February, against Hull City. Snodgrass scored against Bristol City on 12 February. Snodgrass missed Leeds' last few games of the season after suffering a back injury.

In June 2011, it was reported that Leeds had put an £8 million valuation on Snodgrass and that they were looking into offering him a new contract. Snodgrass missed the League Cup match in August 2011 against Bradford City as he had been called up to the Scotland squad. He started for Leeds on the opening day of the season as they lost 3–1 against Southampton. He scored his first goal of the season on 16 August, when he scored a freekick against Hull City. Snodgrass was ruled out of action when he had an emergency operation to have his appendix removed on 31 December 2011. He returned to action for Leeds just two weeks later, scoring in a 1–1 draw against Crystal Palace on 14 January 2012. On 21 January, he scored a goal in a 3–1 win over Ipswich.

Snodgrass was appointed club captain by new Leeds manager Neil Warnock, ahead of his first game in charge against Portsmouth on 25 February. Warnock confirmed he had offered Snodgrass a new contract which would make him Leeds' highest-paid player. Snodgrass finished the season with 13 goals and the second highest amount of assists in The Championship, with 14. Snodgrass won both Leeds' Fans Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards during the club's end of season awards ceremony on 28 April.

Snodgrass signed for Norwich City on a three-year contract in July 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in the opening game of the season on 18 August 2012, a 5–0 defeat away to Fulham. Two matches later, on 1 September 2012, Snodgrass scored his first goal for the club when he scored the equaliser which saw Norwich draw 1–1 with Tottenham Hotspur. He scored his second goal on 28 November, scoring a free-kick in a 1–1 draw against Southampton.

Snodgrass would go on to establish himself as a regular in the first team squad. After a successful campaign in which the club finished 11th in the table, he would be voted by Norwich fans as second place in the Player of the Season that season. He narrowly missed out on the trophy, which was won by Sébastien Bassong instead.

Snodgrass scored his first goal of the 2013–14 season with a "free-kick from around 20 yards that looped over the wall and into the bottom-left corner of the net" in a 3–1 win over West Ham United on 9 November. He scored again on 23 February 2014 against Tottenham after a cutting through ball from Bradley Johnson, holding off the defender and placing it past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from just inside the box. That goal turned out to be the only goal, as Norwich won 1–0.

On 30 June 2014, Hull City signed Snodgrass for an undisclosed fee, believed to exceed £6 million, on a three-year contract. Snodgrass dislocated a kneecap during a 1–0 win at Queens Park Rangers in August 2014. The injury, which required surgery to heal, was initially expected to keep Snodgrass out of action for several months. A month later, it was reported that he would be out of action for the entirety of the 2014–15 season. Snodgrass made his first appearance in a game since the injury in November 2015, playing in an under-21 Premier League Cup match. His first return to first-team action was in the League Cup away to Manchester City on 1 December 2015 when he came on as a replacement for Sone Aluko in the 73rd-minute. On 9 January 2016, in the third-round of the FA Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion, he scored a penalty to take the team through the next round. On 10 December 2016 Snodgrass won a penalty in a crucial home tie against Crystal Palace. Replays showed that he dived and he later apologized.

In January 2017, Hull accepted offers of about £10 million for Snodgrass from West Ham and Burnley.

On 27 January 2017, Snodgrass joined West Ham United on a three-and-a-half-year deal for a fee of £10.2 million. He made his West Ham debut on 1 February 2017, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute for Pedro Obiang, in West Ham's 0–4 home defeat by Manchester City. His first start for the club came away at Saint Mary's Stadium against Southampton, which West Ham won 1–3. In August 2017, having played 15 games for West Ham without scoring, Snodgrass was told that he was free to leave the club either permanently or on loan. 

Snodgrass spent most of the 2017–18 season on loan at Aston Villa, after which he returned to West Ham. He scored his first two goals for West Ham in their 8–0 win against Macclesfield Town in the EFL Cup on 26 September 2018. In March 2019, Snodgrass was charged by the Football Association with allegedly abusing anti-doping officials who were visiting West Ham's training ground on 6 February 2019 to conduct out-of-competition testing.

On 25 August 2017, Snodgrass joined Aston Villa for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. Snodgrass impressed with his early performances for Aston Villa winning praise from manager, Steve Bruce. He scored his first goal for the club in a 4–0 win over Burton Albion on 26 September.

During his loan spell he scored seven goals and got 14 assists, to help Aston Villa secure a play-off place and defeat Middlesbrough in the two semi finals to reach the final, playing in the final, as Villa lost 1–0 to Fulham in the final missing out on promotion to the Premier League. His 14 assists also saw him finish joint top (with Barry Douglas) of the assists charts in the EFL Championship.

Snodgrass is a former Scotland under-19, under-20 and under-21 international. With the under-19 team, he was part of the squad that reached the final of the 2006 European Championships in Poland, although Snodgrass was suspended for the final itself. Snodgrass also played for Scotland under-20 in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada It was his form in this tournament that led to Barcelona showing interest in Snodgrass.

Leeds' involvement in the play-offs against Millwall in 2009 meant that Snodgrass was unavailable to play in a Scotland B international.

Snodgrass was called up to the senior Scotland squad by George Burley for the first time for their friendly against Japan in October 2009. He was forced to withdraw from the squad due to a knee injury. Snodgrass made his full international debut on 9 February 2011, coming on as a substitute against Northern Ireland in a 2011 Nations Cup match. Snodgrass was called up to the Scotland squad to face Brazil on 21 March 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute. Scotland lost the game 2–0. Snodgrass was ruled out of Scotland's Nations Cup matches against Wales and the Republic of Ireland with a back injury.

On 2 August 2011, Snodgrass was called up to the squad for a friendly against Denmark. He made his first start for Scotland against Denmark and also scored his first international goal in this game. On 7 June 2013, during 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Croatia, inflicting their first competitive defeat at home since they lost 4–1 to England in 2008.

The kneecap injury that Snodgrass suffered in August 2014 caused him to miss the whole of the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He was recalled to the national squad for a friendly match against the Czech Republic in March 2016. In the first match of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Snodgrass scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win against Malta.

Snodgrass has a daughter, Sienna, with his girlfriend Denise.

On 24 January 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for Snodgrass after he failed to turn up to court regarding an alleged driving offence. A spokesman for Leeds United said that the non-appearance was due to a misunderstanding and that Snodgrass was working with the judicial authorities to resolve the matter.

On 3 March 2017, another arrest warrant was issued for him after he failed to attend his trial for allegedly driving in Glasgow with a baby being held in the arms of a passenger. His defence lawyer said that Snodgrass' absence was due to a misunderstanding.

Pedro Obiang

Pedro Mba Obiang Avomo (born 27 March 1992) is a Spanish-born Equatoguinean professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club West Ham United and the Equatorial Guinea national team. He had previously played for Sampdoria, before moving to London, and the Premier League, in 2015. Obiang has represented Spain at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels before switching to represent the Equatorial Guinea national football team.

Born in Alcalá de Henares, in the Community of Madrid, Obiang began his football career playing for various teams from his home city such CD Avance, RSD Alcalá and AD Naya, where he excelled. Due to these participations, he was transferred to the Cadete team of Atlético Madrid. He left Atlético for Sampdoria in 2008 at age 16, the minimum age that international transfer within the European Union is allowed. He was the member of "Allievi Nazionali" youth team in 2008–09 season, but also call-up to the first team in pre-season. He was also an unused substitute against Lazio and against Chievo, by the decision of head coach Walter Mazzarri. In 2009–10, he was promoted to senior youth team – Primavera.

Primary a youth team player, Obiang also played seven times in pre-season friendlies in summer 2010, scoring two goals. After the injury crisis of the Genoese team in which the team lost midfielders Stefano Guberti, Fernando Tissone, Andrea Poli and Paolo Sammarco, he received a call-up again from new head coach Domenico Di Carlo, and made his competitive debut on 12 September 2010. He substituted Vladimir Koman in the 58th minute, at that time Sampdoria losing 1–2 to Juventus; eventually, Sampdoria 3–3 draw at Stadio Olimpico di Torino. Obiang signed a new, five-year contract extension with Doria on the morning before the start of the match.

Obiang also named in 2010–11 UEFA Champions League 25-men senior squad (list A) for play-off round and received the call-up against Werder Bremen, however Obiang was not named as one of players on the substitutes' bench. He also received his first call-up for 2010–11 UEFA Europa League on 28 September 2010 as list B players (Under-21 youth product). He made his European debut on 16 December 2010 (matchday 6), with the club already eliminated before the match, a 0–2 defeat to Debreceni.

On 10 June 2015, West Ham United announced the signing of Obiang for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract. He made his Premier League debut on 15 August as a half-time substitute for Reece Oxford in a 1–2 home defeat to Leicester City. In November 2016, Obiang was announced as West Ham's Player of the Month for October.

On 4 February 2017, Obiang scored his first Premier League goal for "the Hammers" on his 55th appearance for the club, against Southampton. The ball fell to Obiang from a corner, where he controlled, and then shot finding the bottom corner from 25 yards out. On 20 March 2017, he was ruled out for the remainder of the 2016–17 season, having rolled his ankle during a home defeat by Leicester on 18 March 2017.
In January 2018, Obiang was injured during an FA Cup game against Wigan Athletic. In February he underwent knee surgery and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2017–18 season.

Obiang has been capped for Spain at youth levels. Obiang received a call up for Porto International Tournament in April 2011.

Due to his Fang background, the Gabonese Football Federation tried unsuccessfully to persuade Obiang to play for Gabon, although both his parents and his grandparents are from Equatorial Guinea. In November 2011, they included him in a squad list for a match between the country's under-20 and China, however he ignored the call.

Being eligible to represent Equatorial Guinea, in 2011, the country's federation approached Obiang to enquire if he would be willing to represent the country at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, however Obiang declined, which he later claimed was a mistake. In April 2015, after a meeting with the Equatoguinean Football Federation people, Obiang's stance on representing Equatorial Guinea appeared to have changed after showing a desire to play for the country. On 5 October 2016, Obiang reunited in London with Equatoguinean Football Federation president Andrés Mbomio, and Equatoguinean national team head coach and coordinator Esteban Becker and Juvenal Edjogo-Owono respectively to reach an agreement.

On 7 November 2018, Obiang was officially called up for the Equatorial Guinea national team. Obiang made his debut for Equatorial Guinea in a 1–0 loss to Senegal on 18 November 2018. In December 2018 he said he was "proud" to play for the nation.

Carlos Sánchez Moreno

Carlos Alberto Sánchez Moreno (born 6 February 1986) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for English Club West Ham United. He is nicknamed "La Roca" ("The Rock"), due to his strength on the pitch.

He began his career at River Plate Montevideo before moving to Valenciennes in 2007, where he made 178 Ligue 1 appearances and scored ten goals across six seasons. He later played in La Liga for Elche and Espanyol, the Premier League for Aston Villa and Serie A for Fiorentina.

A full international since 2007, Sánchez has earned over 80 caps for Colombia. He was part of the squads that reached the quarter-finals of the 2011 Copa América, 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 Copa América, and finished third in the 2016 Copa América Centenario.

Born in Quibdó, Chocó, Sánchez moved to a football school in Medellín and then onto Uruguayan club Danubio, where he signed his first professional contract in 2003 and was a teammate of Edinson Cavani. However, he was released two years later, making no first-team appearances.

In the summer of 2005, Sánchez joined fellow league team River Plate Montevideo. He featured in 40 matches during his two-year spell, scoring once.

In July 2007, Sánchez was bought by a group of investors and was assigned to Rangers de Talca, subsequently moving abroad for the first time in his career, by agreeing to a five-year deal with Ligue 1 side Valenciennes. He made his debut on 4 August, starting in a 3–1 home win against Toulouse.

Sánchez featured regularly for the side in his debut campaign, and was an ever-present figure during the following seasons. In March 2010, he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament, being sidelined nearly a year.

After making 148 appearances for the club, scoring 8 goals in the league, Sánchez left the club in the summer of 2012 when his contract expired. After long negotiations with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, he failed to reach an agreement with any club, and subsequently rejoined his former club Valenciennes on 25 August 2012.

On 16 August 2013, Sánchez signed a three-year deal with Spanish side Elche, freshly promoted to La Liga, for a €3.7 million fee. He made his debut on 24 August, starting in a 1–1 home draw against Real Sociedad.

On 15 August 2014, Aston Villa announced the signing of Sánchez on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee reported to be around £4.7 million. His first Villa appearance came eight days later when he replaced Charles N'Zogbia as a substitute in the 62nd minute of a goalless draw with Newcastle United at Villa Park. He made his first start for the club in their 0–3 home defeat against Arsenal on 20 September, after illness had ruled out some of his teammates. On 11 April 2015, he was sent off for two yellow cards as the team won 1–0 away to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, causing him to miss their victory over Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final eight days later. Sánchez scored his first goal for Villa on 25 April, an 85th-minute deflected volleyed equaliser away to title holders Manchester City, but Fernandinho later netted a winner for City. He made a 19-minute substitute appearance in the 2015 FA Cup Final on 30 May at Wembley Stadium in place of Ashley Westwood, in an eventual 0–4 loss to Arsenal.

On 10 August 2016, after Villa's relegation, Sánchez was loaned to Serie A club Fiorentina for a season. He made his debut ten days later as a 65th-minute substitute for Milan Badelj in a 2–1 loss away to reigning champions Juventus on the first day of the season. Eight days later, he made his first start in a 1–0 home win over Chievo, in which he scored the goal. The move was made permanent at the end of the campaign.

On 31 January 2018, Sánchez returned to La Liga on loan to RCD Espanyol for the remainder of the season. He made his debut four days later in a 1–1 home draw with FC Barcelona in the "Derbi barceloní", playing the final four minutes in place of Léo Baptistão.

On 9 August 2018, Sánchez signed a two-year deal with English Premier League club West Ham United.

Sánchez made his international debut against Panama on 9 May 2007. He was then included in the 34-man provisional squad for the Copa América 2007, but later dropped for the final list. He was in the first team for all of Colombia's matches for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification including the 2–1 victory over Argentina on 20 November 2007 in Bogotá. At the 2011 Copa América, he started three of Colombia's four matches as they reached the quarter-finals, coming into the team at the expense of Gustavo Bolívar after the opening game. He played in all five of Colombia's matches in the FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014, playing a defensive role which allowed James Rodríguez and Juan Cuadrado to be attacking midfielders.

Sánchez was included in Colombia's squad for the 2015 Copa América, where he was credited with "dominating" Neymar during his man of the match performance in the 1–0 group stage defeat of Brazil in Santiago.

He was the first player sent off in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, for handball in the third minute against Japan, giving away a penalty from which Shinji Kagawa opened the scoring in a 2–1 win for the Japanese; only José Batista of Uruguay in 1986 was sent off quicker. Sánchez received death threats for his red card, which were likened by BBC Sport to the assassination of Colombia player Andrés Escobar for his own goal at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Manager José Pékerman dedicated the team's 3–0 win over Poland to the suspended Sánchez.

Sánchez is married to Noelia Polvoria, whom he met in Montevideo.

Mark Noble

Mark James Noble (born 8 May 1987) is an English footballer who plays as a central midfielder and is captain of West Ham United. He has played almost all his youth and first team football for West Ham apart from two short loan spells, at Hull City and Ipswich Town. He has played for England at U16, U17, U18, U19 and U21 levels. He captained the U21 side, scoring three goals in 20 appearances. Noble is the longest serving player in West Ham's current squad, having been in the first team since 2004. He is West Ham's first-choice taker for penalty kicks and has won the club's Hammer of the Year trophy twice.

In 2014, he was ranked in the top five penalty takers in the top European leagues and was in the top 10 in the world based on the percentage of penalties successfully converted since 2009. Noble has played more Premier League games for West Ham than any other player.

Born in Canning Town, East London, Noble played for Barking Colts and moved to Arsenal's academy at age 11. His father, however, who would drive him to training, could not always arrange the time to get Noble to training sessions due to the distance from their home in Beckton. Local side West Ham United showed an interest and Noble signed as a youth player. He became the youngest player ever to appear in their reserve team, aged 15. He became a trainee in July 2003 and made his debut in the senior team at the age of just 17 in the League Cup in August 2004 in a 2–0 win against Southend United. He made his league debut in the Championship in January 2005, in a 4–2 defeat away at Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 30 May 2005, Noble played in the 2005 Football League Championship play-off Final which saw West Ham beat Preston North End 1–0 to secure a return to the Premier League. He had entered the game as an 82nd-minute substitute for Shaun Newton.

Noble won the Young Hammer of the Year and the runner-up to the Hammer of the Year awards despite making his debut only four months previously.

Upon West Ham's return to the Premier League, he featured in only five League games in the 2005–06 season, including those against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 November 2005 and against Manchester United on 27 November, but after a game against Blackburn Rovers on 10 December, he found regular playing time harder to come by and was sent out on loan. He did not play for West Ham at all in 2006.

Noble was subsequently loaned to Hull City where he made five appearances. His Hull debut came on 18 February 2006 in a 1–0 away defeat by Cardiff City. Noble's loan ended early after he suffered an injury to his lower back.

Noble signed a three-month loan with Ipswich Town in August 2006 in the hope of gaining necessary first-team experience. He played 13 games in the Championship and scored his first professional goal on 12 September in a 2–1 home win over Coventry City.

Noble scored his first goal for West Ham against Brighton & Hove Albion, the side's first of three in a 3–0 home win in January 2007 in the third round of the FA Cup, from an assist by Carlos Tevez. On 4 March, he scored his first Premiership goal and the opening goal of the game, against Tottenham at Upton Park in a game West Ham eventually lost 4–3 in the final seconds. He played 11 games in all competitions, scoring three goals in the 2006–07 season.

Noble established his place in Alan Curbishley's side during the 2007–08 season, starting nearly all games when fit. He scored his first penalty for the club on 18 August 2007 in a 1–0 away win against Birmingham City after Colin Doyle had fouled Craig Bellamy. He was out for several weeks in November 2007 after he had played through an injury for the last several months without letting the medical staff know. In January 2008, Noble scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool from the penalty spot, after Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher had brought down Freddie Ljungberg in the last few seconds of second-half added time. His performance in the match was described as "exceptional".

The 2008–09 season did not start well for Noble, as he was sent off for two bookable offences in a 3–0 loss away at Manchester City, the first away game of the season. After serving his suspension he came back to score an equaliser against West Bromwich Albion after West Ham went a goal down with West Brom coming back to win 3–2. This was one of five goals he scored in the season with three coming from the penalty spot. After Alan Curbishley left in September, he remained in the first team under new manager Gianfranco Zola. He celebrated his 100th appearance for the Hammers by scoring against Blackburn at Ewood Park on 21 March 2009 to secure a 1–1 draw. In April, he signed a contract extension tying him to the club until 2013.

Noble began the 2009–10 season well, scoring West Ham's first goal of the new season, in a 2–0 win over Premier League newcomers Wolves. Under Gianfranco Zola, Noble established himself in central midfield in a diamond that included Scott Parker as his partner and Jack Collison and Valon Behrami on the wings. He would only score one other goal during the season – a penalty after Habib Beye had fouled Zavon Hines – in a 2–1 home win against Aston Villa on 4 November 2009.

With West Ham now managed by Avram Grant, Noble continued to be a regular member of the first team. He played 26 of a possible 38 games in the Premier League missing a month of the season after an appendectomy as West Ham were relegated after finishing in 20th and bottom place. He scored four league goals, all were penalties including two in one game. On 2 April 2011 against Manchester United his two penalties had put West Ham 2–0 up only for Wayne Rooney to score a hat-trick which, with another goal by Javier Hernández, won the game 4–2 for Manchester United.

During the 2011–12 season with West Ham now back in the Championship, Noble scored eight goals, seven of which were penalties, his only goal from open play coming in a 4–0 away win against Barnsley. Having twice previously been runner-up, Noble was named Hammer of the Year for the 2011–12 season.
In May 2012 Noble played in the 2012 Football League Championship play-off Final at Wembley Stadium against Blackpool which West Ham won 2–1 to return to the Premier League after a one-year absence. By the end of the season, he had played 49 games in all competitions, missing just one of their Championship games.

In September 2012, Noble signed a new three-year contract with an option for a further two years. In February 2013, he was out injured after having been diagnosed with a compression of the thoracic outlet. He did not return until 17 April 2013 in a 2–2 home draw against Manchester United. The missing games saw Noble's tally for the season at 31 games in all competitions with four goals scored. Three goals were penalties with his one-goal from open play coming in a 4–1 home win against Southampton on 20 October 2012.

Noble scored three goals in the 2013–14 season, the only one from open play being the second goal in a 2–0 away win over Cardiff City in January, despite the team being down to ten men after a James Tomkins sending off. On 6 May 2014, Noble received his second Hammer of the Year, beating runner up Adrián and third-placed James Tomkins. On the same awards night, Noble also won the Players' Player of the Year accolade.

Noble missed a penalty in a 0–1 home defeat by Tottenham on 16 August 2014, the opening game of the season, but scored his first goal of the season in the next home game, on 30 August, a 1–3 home defeat by Southampton. On 29 November 2014, Noble became West Ham's record appearance maker in the Premier League with his appearance against Newcastle United being his 205th Premier League game, overtaking Steve Potts. Noble signed a contract extension which would keep him at West Ham until 2020, with an option for a further year, on 26 February 2015.

Noble's first goal of the season came from the penalty spot in a 3–4 home defeat by Premier League newcomers, AFC Bournemouth on 22 August 2015. The following week, he scored the second goal in a 3–0 away win against Liverpool; this was West Ham's first win at Anfield since 1963. Noble made his 350th senior appearance for West Ham on 6 February 2016, in a 1–0 defeat away at Southampton. The following week, he scored his third goal of the season, netting West Ham's equalizer in the 77th minute of their 2–2 draw away at Norwich City. On 22 December 2015, it had been announced that Noble was to be granted a testimonial by West Ham following his long service to the club. The game was played on 28 March 2016 between a West Ham XI and a West Ham United all-stars team made up of former players, with all proceeds going to charity. The game was won 6–5 by the West Ham XI in front of 36,000 spectators and featured a goal by Paolo Di Canio and two by Dean Ashton, including a bicycle kick described as "stunning".

On 10 May 2016, Noble became the final man to lead a West Ham United team out at Upton Park, as the Hammers went on to win their final game at their former home 3–2 against Manchester United.

In March 2017 sections of West Ham supporters called for him to be dropped from the team. Noble described the season as "the most difficult of his career". On 8 April 2017, having played against Swansea City, Noble marked his 400th appearance for West Ham becoming the 19th player to pass this number. He played 35 games in all competitions for West Ham in the 2016–17 season scoring five goals, two in the Europa League and three in the Premier League. His season finished early with two games remaining for West Ham as he required an abdominal operation.

Noble marked his 300th Premier League appearance with a goal from the penalty spot against Stoke City on 16 December 2017. In March 2018, there were protests against David Sullivan and the West Ham United board at the London Stadium during a 3-0 home defeat to Burnley. There were four pitch invasions with one fan approaching Noble on the pitch. In scenes described as "horrific", Noble grappled with the supporter, throwing him to the ground. On 5 May 2018, he scored the second goal in a 2–0 away win at Leicester City, a result which ensured West Ham's survival in the Premier League. Noble described the goal, a volley from the edge of the penalty area, as "the best of his career".

Noble captained the England U18 team. He was a member of the England U19 team that beat Serbia and Montenegro U19s 3–1 in the 2005 European Championship semi-finals, although they subsequently lost the final to France.

Noble made his debut for the England U-21 team on 11 June 2007, coming on as substitute in the 82nd minute for Tom Huddlestone in England's 0–0 draw with the Czech Republic during the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, held in the Netherlands. He established himself in the starting XI for the remaining matches and scored twice in a dramatic semi-final penalty shootout against the Netherlands where England lost 13–12.
On 11 September 2007, Noble scored his first international goal for the under-21 team against Bulgaria in a 2–0 victory, followed by two more against the Republic of Ireland on 16 October.

Noble captained the U21s at the 2009 European Championships as regular captain Steven Taylor had to withdraw due to injury. The Young Lions ended the tournament as runners-up, losing 4–0 to Germany, with Noble playing his last match for the U21s.

Noble is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national side through his Cork-born grandparents. In August 2014, despite stating on numerous occasions about his ambition of playing for England at senior level, it was reported by the "Irish Independent" that he could be willing to make himself available for the Irish national team.

In May 2016, Noble was granted freedom of the Borough of Newham for his services to the borough.

Noble has been married to childhood sweetheart Carly since 2012. The couple have a son and a daughter.

Javier Hernández

Javier Hernández Balcázar (; born 1 June 1988) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a striker for club West Ham United and the Mexico national team. Hernández is commonly known by his nickname, Chicharito (; Mexican Spanish: "little pea"), which he wears on his shirt.

Hernández began his career in 2006, playing for Mexican club Guadalajara. In July 2010, he became the first Mexican player to join Manchester United, scoring 20 goals and winning the Premier League in his debut season. After falling out of favour under managers David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, he spent the 2014–15 season on loan at Real Madrid. In August 2015, Hernández signed for Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen. After two seasons in Germany, Hernández returned to the Premier League and joined West Ham United. His minutes-per-goal ratio is among the most prolific in the history of the Premier League.

A Mexican international, Hernández is the country's all-time leading goalscorer. He made his debut for the national team in September 2009 in a friendly match against Colombia. He has represented Mexico at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Copa América Centenario, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He was the 2011 Gold Cup's top scorer with seven goals and was named the most valuable player of the tournament.

Hernández was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco and first played in a recreation league when he was seven years old. Hernández lived in Morelia, Michoacán for over four years while his father, footballer Javier "Chícharo" Hernández, played for Monarcas Morelia. While living in Morelia, Hernández attended elementary school at the "Instituto Piaget" where he studied from third to sixth grade and played for the school's football team.

At the age of nine, Hernández joined C.D. Guadalajara and signed his first professional contract when he was 15. He was set to play in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, but an injury sidelined him from the team that ultimately won the championship. Whilst playing football professionally, Hernández was also taking business administration classes at Universidad del Valle de Atemajac. Hernández has held both Hugo Sánchez and Rafael Márquez as his football idols growing up.

Hernández began playing with Chivas' lower division team, Chivas Coras in Tepic, Nayarit in the 2005–06 season. He made his debut for Chivas in the 2006 Apertura in a win over Necaxa at Estadio Jalisco. With the score at 3–0, Hernández came on as a substitute for Omar Bravo in the 82nd minute, before scoring the fourth goal of the game five minutes later. It was his only goal in seven appearances in 2006–07. He made a further six appearances in 2007–08 without scoring.

Hernández made ten appearances in the 2008 Apertura without scoring, but he scored four goals in fifteen appearances in the 2009 Clausura. In the 2009 Apertura, Hernández finished as the joint-third top scorer, with eleven goals in seventeen appearances. He started the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario with eight goals in five games. He finished as a joint-leader in the goalscoring chart for the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, with ten goals in eleven games and after spent 5 matches without playing because of an injury he suffered.

Manchester United were first made aware of Hernández in October 2009; a scout went to Mexico that December and reported positively after watching a few games. Because of Hernández's age, the club originally planned to wait before making a move to sign him, but his potential involvement with the national team at the World Cup rushed the club into making a bid. United's chief scout, Jim Lawlor, was sent to Mexico for three weeks in February and March to watch Hernández and filed another positive report on him, before the club solicitor went over to Mexico to finalise the paperwork.

On 8 April 2010, Hernández agreed a deal to sign for Manchester United for an undisclosed fee, subject to a work permit application. The previous day, Hernández had been present at Manchester United's Champions League quarter-final win over Bayern Munich at Old Trafford. The deal was conducted in complete secrecy; Hernández's agent was kept in the dark, as was his grandfather Tomás Balcázar, who thought Hernández was going on a trip to Atlanta in the United States. As part of the deal, United played a friendly against Chivas to open the Mexican club's new stadium on 30 July. On 27 May, the work permit was granted, allowing the transfer to be made official on 1 July.

Hernández made his United debut on 28 July, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Nani in the 2010 MLS All-Star Game at the NRG Stadium, Houston; he scored his first goal for the club 18 minutes later, lobbing the ball over Nick Rimando from just outside the area after a long through-ball from Darren Fletcher.

Hernández played in what proved to be his final match for Manchester United on 22 August in a scoreless draw against Newcastle United at Old Trafford. He came on as a substitute in the 67th minute, replacing Adnan Januzaj.

On 31 August 2015, it was announced Hernández signed a three-year contract with Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen for an undisclosed fee, reportedly £7.3 million.

In response, Moyes referred to him as a "top goalscorer," and "a brilliant finisher." During the winter transfer window there were reports Hernández would exit the club after only six months, being linked with a move to Turkish club Beşiktaş as well as a possible return to Manchster United. On 20 January 2018, he came off the bench to score the equalizing goal for West Ham in their 1–1 league draw against Bournemouth, scoring his first goal since October.

He would go on to start in all group stage matches, including the round-of-16 loss against Brazil.

A clinical goalscorer, Hernández has been described as a "goal-poacher", due to a number of his goals being scored from close-range. His movement off the ball, pace, and ability to find space inside the box has also been praised. He has been described as one of the few players who seem capable of appearing behind a defender's back to knock in the ball from two yards, with his playing style being compared to that of German striker Miroslav Klose.

Rudi Völler, sporting director of Bayer Leverkusen, has praised Hernández for his keen positioning in front of goal, saying: "he certainly doesn't win every tackle but he has an incredible sense of where the ball will end up". Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described Hernández as two-footed, very quick, in possession of a good spring, and a natural goalscorer. Ferguson also said Hernández's style reminds him of former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær – the so-called "baby-faced assassin" who scored the injury time winner against Bayern Munich in United's 1999 Champions League triumph. Hernández's former teammate Jesús Padilla described him as "amazing in the air" despite his height.
Due to his small stature, he is extremely quick and agile, also possessing good technique.

In a May 2016 interview with "Sports Illustrated", Hernández commented on his abilities inside the penalty area, describing the intuition he has in knowing where an impending cross will fall from a teammate and outsmarting opposing defenders.

Former Mexico national team coach Juan Carlos Osorio described Hernández as having "a knack for the goal. Sometimes it seems like every rebound or every deflection goes into his path. Another thing is he doesn't dwell on a missed opportunity. He always looks forward to the next one. He has good ability in the air. He has good pace, and he makes those diagonal runs starting from the first defender in behind the second one. He also has the willingness to work defensively."

Hernández is the son of Javier Hernández Gutiérrez, who played for three clubs in Mexico and was a member of the Mexico squad at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Hernández Gutiérrez quit his job as manager of Guadalajara's reserve side in order to watch Hernández play in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Hernández is also the grandson of Tomás Balcázar, who also played for Guadalajara and played for the national side in the 1954 FIFA World Cup.

On 26 May 2012, Hernández became the Mexican ambassador for UNICEF, making him the third Mexican to serve this position, following César Costa and Julieta Venegas in 2004 and 2009 respectively. As ambassador, he will participate in a number of activities to encourage children and teenagers to not abandon their education. He was commemorated in a news conference, where he said he felt "proud and committed".

Hernández is a devout Roman Catholic. He is well known for his pre-game ritual where he gets on his knees and prays which he performs before most games. On 27 June 2013, EA Sports announced that they had featured Hernández on the North American cover of "FIFA 14", alongside global cover star Lionel Messi.

In January 2019, Hernández and his girlfriend Sarah Kohan, an Australian model and travel blogger, announced on Instagram that they were expecting their first child.

Hernández is commonly known as "Chicharito", meaning "little pea" in Spanish, and wears the name on his shirt. This is due to his father, Javier Hernández Gutiérrez, being nicknamed "Chícharo" ("pea") because of his green eyes.

Samir Nasri

Samir Nasri (born 26 June 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays for Premier League club West Ham United. He primarily plays as an attacking midfielder and a winger, although he has also been deployed in central midfield. He was suspended from football for eighteen months until January 2019 following a doping violation.

Nasri is known for his dribbling, ball control and passing ability. He is described as a player whose "vision and imagination make him an unpredictable opponent". His playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to French legend Zinedine Zidane.

Nasri began his football career playing for local youth clubs in his hometown Marseille. At age nine, he joined professional club Olympique de Marseille and spent the next seven years developing in the club's youth academy at La Commanderie, the club's training centre. In the 2004–05 season, he made his professional debut in September 2004 at age 17 against Sochaux. In the following season, he became a regular starter in the team and also participated in European competition for the first time after playing in the 2005–06 edition of the UEFA Cup. In the 2006–07 campaign, Nasri won the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Young Player of the Year award and was also named to the Team of the Year. He finished his career with Marseille amassing over 160 appearances. He played in the teams that reached back-to-back Coupe de France finals in 2006 and 2007.

In June 2008, Nasri joined Premier League club Arsenal on a four-year contract. He reached prominence with the team in his third season winning the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Fans' Player of the Month award on three occasions and being named to the association's Team of the Year. In December 2010, he was named the French Player of the Year for his performances during the calendar year. In August 2011, after three seasons with Arsenal, Nasri joined Manchester City on a four-year contract. In his first season with the club, he won his first major honour as a player as the club won the 2011–12 Premier League.

Nasri is a former France youth international and has represented his nation at every level for which he was eligible. Prior to playing for the senior team, he played on the under-17 team that won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. Nasri made his senior international debut in March 2007 in a friendly match against Austria. Two months later, he scored his first senior international goal in a 1–0 UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying win over Georgia. Nasri has represented France at two major international tournaments: UEFA Euro 2008 and Euro 2012.

Samir Nasri () was born in Septèmes-les-Vallons, a northern suburb of Marseille, to French nationals of Algerian descent. His mother, Ouassila Ben Saïd, and father, Abdelhafid Nasri, were both born in France; his father being born and raised in Marseille, while his mother being from nearby Salon-de-Provence. Nasri's grandparents emigrated to France from Algeria. His mother is a housewife and his father previously worked as a bus driver before becoming his son's personal manager. At the start of his football career, Nasri initially played under his mother's surname, Ben Saïd, before switching to Nasri, his father's surname, following his selection to the France under-16 team. He is the eldest of four children and is a non-practising Muslim. Nasri has a younger sister named Sonia and twin brothers named Walid and Malik. All four were raised in La Gavotte Peyret. After joining Arsenal in England, Nasri settled in Hampstead, a district of North London.

While growing up in La Gavotte Peyret, Nasri grew an attraction to the sport of football at a young age. He regularly played the sport on the streets where he learned many of his skills. Upon noticing his prodigious talent, his parents signed him up to play with the local club in his hometown. Nasri spent one year playing with the club in La Gavotte Peyret before moving to Pennes Mirabeau in nearby Mirabeau at age seven. While playing with Pennes, Nasri was discovered by Marseille scout Freddy Assolen, who had been informed of the player's talent through local word of mouth. After noticing Nasri's skill in person, Assolen recruited the player to travel with a group of other young players to Italy to participate in a youth tournament where they would play against the youth academies of Milan and Juventus. Nasri impressed at the tournament and Assolen was jokingly told by a Milan scout that "he [Nasri] stays here, you leave him". After returning to France, Marseille officials organized a meeting with the player's father and the group agreed to allow Nasri insertion into the club's academy at the age of nine.

Upon entering the Marseille youth academy, Nasri quickly impressed. Upon moving to Bastide, where the club's youth players reside, his style of play began to take shape. In 2007, Nasri admitted that the move to Bastide really helped his game, stating, "That's where I really started to progress. Training was different and the facilities are beautiful, all of which helps you work well." As a result of his quick progression, Nasri was an integral part of every youth team he was a part of winning several trophies, such as the Championnat de Provence, Coupe de Provence, and the Ligue de la Méditerranée. After spending most of the 2003–04 season playing with the club's under-18 team, for the latter part of the season, the now 16-year-old Nasri was promoted to the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. He appeared primarily as a substitute in a few matches during the campaign as the reserve team failed to rebound from its bad start to the season, which resulted in a 16th-place finish and relegation to the Championnat de France amateur 2.

Ahead of the 2004–05 season, several clubs were reported to be interested in signing Nasri, most notably English clubs Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle United. In an effort to decrease the speculation, Nasri was offered a three-year professional contract by Marseille officials led by president Pape Diouf and manager José Anigo. On 13 August 2004, Nasri agreed to the contract. Marseille officials had been eager to sign Nasri to a contract in an attempt to not undergo a situation similar to the departure of Mathieu Flamini, in which the player departed the club without Marseille receiving any compensation. As a result of his professional contract, Nasri was promoted to the senior team by Anigo and assigned the number 22 shirt. He began the season playing on the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning a call up to the senior team in September 2004.

Nasri made his professional debut on 12 September in a 2–0 league defeat to Sochaux, appearing as a substitute for Bruno Cheyrou. On 17 October, he made his first professional start playing the entire match in a 1–1 draw with Saint-Étienne. Nasri featured heavily within the team under Anigo and later Philippe Troussier. In the team's first match following the winter break, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 away victory over Lille. Nasri finished his rookie campaign with 25 total appearances, one goal and two assists.

The 2005–06 season saw Marseille boosted by the arrival of attackers Franck Ribéry and Djibril Cissé, the latter arriving after having a successful loan stint with the club the previous season. Nasri, who was now given a more prominent role within the team by new manager Jean Fernandez, formed impressive partnerships with the two along with lead striker Mamadou Niang. He appeared in 49 total matches, which included appearances in both the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Nasri made his European debut on 16 July 2005 in the first round of the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup against Swiss club Young Boys. Marseille won the first leg 3–2. In the second leg, Nasri scored his first European goal in a 2–1 win. Marseille ultimately won the competition after beating Spanish outfit Deportivo de La Coruña 5–3 on aggregate. In the league, Nasri appeared in 30 matches, 25 as a starter. He scored his only league goal of the season on 29 April 2007 in a 4–2 win over Sochaux. In the Coupe de France, Nasri appeared in five matches as Marseille reached the final of the competition where the club faced "Le Classique" rivals Paris Saint-Germain. Nasri appeared as a substitute in the match as Marseille were defeated 2–1. Following the season, Nasri signed a two-year contract extension with the club until 2009.

Nasri began the 2006–07 season playing under Albert Emon, his fourth different manager in three years. Despite this, Marseille's now heightened popularity saw increased speculation from writers and supporters that the club would finally win its first league title since the 1991–92 season. Nasri began the season on a quick note scoring the second goal in the team's 3–1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in September 2006. On 29 April 2007, Nasri scored a goal in Marseille's 4–2 hammering of Sochaux. Marseille were due to face the same club in the 2007 Coupe de France Final just days later and were, subsequently, heavy favorites as a result of the team's two-goal victory in the previous match. However, Sochaux recorded an upset victory defeating Marseille 5–4 on penalties after the match ended 2–2 following extra time. On the final match day of the season, Nasri converted the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sedan. The victory secured 2nd place for Marseille and was the club's best finish since finishing runner-up to Bordeaux in the 1998–99 season. Nasri finished the season with a career-high 50 appearances, 37 of them in the league. For his efforts, he was awarded the UNFP Young Player of the Year award and named to the Team of the Year. Nasri was also voted the Club Player of the Year by supporters, receiving 62% of the votes ahead of the likes of Ribéry and Niang.

Similar to his previous three years at Marseille, Nasri began the new season under new management as the club was now being led by the Belgian Eric Gerets. Due to the departure of Ribéry to Bayern Munich, Gerets installed Nasri as the focal point of the attack and he responding by having his best season at the club. He appeared in 42 total matches scoring a career-high six goals and also assisting on a career-high 15 goals. Nasri formed partnerships in the midfield with winger Mathieu Valbuena and midfielders Lorik Cana and Benoît Cheyrou as Marseille boasted the third-best attack in the league behind champions Lyon and Bordeaux, who finished first and second in the league respectively. Initially, Nasri struggled during the infancy of the campaign due to dealing with the effects of a severely sprained ankle suffered in the pre-season. He failed to score a goal or provide an assist in the team's first eight league matches. On 24 November 2007, he assisted on two goals in a 2–0 victory over Metz. Nasri closed out the fall season by assisting on the equalizing goal in a 2–2 draw with Bordeaux and making the final pass on the match-winning goal against Le Mans.

Following the winter break, Nasri's goal-scoring began to take form. In late January, he scored goals in back-to-back matches against Nancy and Caen. In European competition, Nasri participated in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in his career, however he failed to make an impact in the four group stage matches he appeared in. He missed the club's upset victory over Liverpool at Anfield due to dealing with a bout of meningitis. Marseille ultimately finished the group in third place, which resulted in the team qualifying for the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup. The club was defeated in the round of 16 by Zenit Saint Petersburg despite being up 3–1 heading into the second leg. Of those three goals Marseille scored in the first leg, Nasri assisted on two of them. On 16 March 2008, Nasri scored a goal in a 3–3 draw with Lens. A month later, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Metz. In his final match with Marseille, against Strasbourg, Nasri scored a goal and assisted on another in a 4–3 victory. Marseille finished the league campaign in third place, which resulted in the club qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the second consecutive season. On 8 May 2008, with all the transfer speculation surrounding the player, Nasri surprised many by signing a three-year contract extension with the club until 2012.

One week later, despite signing a contract extension with Marseille, Nasri was linked with a move to Premier League club Arsenal. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had been tracking Nasri since watching him play at the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. It was later revealed that the contract extension Nasri signed with Marseille was simply protocol to allow Marseille to receive a higher transfer fee for the player. The Bouches-du-Rhône-based club was seeking £14 million for the young midfielder. Ahead of UEFA Euro 2008, both Nasri's agent and Wenger admitted that offers were made for the player and that a move to the English club was imminent. The deal was ultimately concluded following the competition on 11 July 2008 with Nasri agreeing to a four-year contract. The transfer fee was undisclosed, but has been purported to be in the region of £12 million. Upon arriving at the club, Nasri admitted Wenger was one of the primary reasons for him joining the club: "The fact that Arsène Wenger gives great opportunities to young players is very important for me. Arsène has a great reputation and he is one of the best managers in the world."

Nasri was given the number 8 shirt – previously worn by Arsenal legends Ian Wright, George Graham, Alan Sunderland and Freddie Ljungberg – and made his club debut on 30 July 2008 in a friendly match against German club VfB Stuttgart in a 3–1 win. He made his Premier League debut in the team's first match of the league season on 16 August against West Bromwich Albion. In the match, Nasri scored his first league goal scoring with a close-range effort, after four minutes in a 1–0 victory. As a result of his debut goal, he became the 83rd player in Premier League history to score on his league debut and the 22nd Arsenal player. On 27 August, Nasri scored his second goal for the club in the team's 2008–09 UEFA Champions League third round qualifying second leg tie against Twente. Arsenal won the match 4–0 and the tie 6–0 on aggregate. On 8 November, Nasri scored both of Arsenal's goals in a 2–1 win over Manchester United.

On 21 December, Nasri assisted on the opening goal scored by Robin van Persie in the team's 1–1 draw with Liverpool. Nasri returned to his scoring form in the new year. On 17 January 2009, he scored the second goal in the club's 3–1 win over Hull City at the KC Stadium. It took Nasri another two months to score another goal, which came in Arsenal's 3–1 away win against Newcastle United. He finished his first campaign at Arsenal appearing in 44 matches, scoring seven goals and providing five assists.

On 21 July 2009, while participating in a training match during pre-season with Arsenal in Bad Waltersdorf, Nasri suffered a broken leg. The injury required two to three months of rest and, as a result, Nasri missed the opening of the 2009–10 Premier League season. He made his debut late in the campaign on 25 October 2009 in a League Cup tie against Liverpool. Nasri played the entire match in a 2–1 win. On 4 November, he scored his first goal of the season in the team's 2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage match against AZ. Three weeks later, Nasri converted another Champions League goal, this time against Standard Liège in a 2–0 win. He featured heavily with the team during the winter months and he ended the 2009 calendar year by scoring a goal and providing an assist 4–1 win over Portsmouth away at Fratton Park.

After going nearly two months without scoring a goal, Nasri marked his goal-scoring return in emphatic fashion in the team's 5–0 second leg victory over Porto in the round of 16 of the Champions League knockout stage. The goal, described by English newspaper "The Guardian" columnist David Lacey as "reminiscent of a lost art in British football", showcased Nasri's dribbling, as well as his individuality. Upon receiving the ball on the right wing from midfielder Abou Diaby, Nasri dribbled through and past three Porto players in a small area of space before bringing the ball past wing-back Álvaro Pereira and driving it across the goalkeeper, sending the ball in off the far post. Nasri goal was subsequently compared by the English media to similar goals that occurred in the country. Three weeks later, after appearing as a substitute in the second half, Nasri scored the opening goal against Birmingham City. Birmingham later equalized through a late goal from Kevin Phillips. The draw ended a string of seven consecutive league victories for Arsenal and Wenger admitted that the draw "was a big blow for our chances [of winning the league]". In the team's final seven league matches, Nasri assisted on goals in a 3–2 loss to Wigan Athletic and a 4–0 home win over Fulham. Arsenal ultimately finished the campaign in third place. Nasri concluded his second season at Arsenal appearing in 34 matches, scoring five goals and providing five assists.

Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Nasri admitted he was determined to re-capture his form that resulted in Arsenal signing him two years prior. He also admitted he did not take missing out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup well, stating, "When I discovered that I wasn't part of the squad for the World Cup, I got a big slap in the face." However, after speaking to Arsène Wenger, who informed him he should use the non-call-up as motivation, Nasri was reassured. Nasri started the campaign well. He was named in Arsenal's starting line-up to play against Liverpool for the first match of the season on 15 August 2010. Nasri played the entire match in a 1–1 draw. After the match, Arsenal confirmed Nasri had suffered a knee injury that would keep him out for a month. However, the player returned to the team after just three matches to help Arsenal defeat Braga 6–0 in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage on his return. On 21 September, he scored a double in the club's 4–1 extra time victory over North London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Both goals were converted from the penalty spot. Fours days later, Nasri scored another double in a 3–2 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion.
Nasri continued his fine form as season wore on. In the club's Champions League group stage tie against Serbian club Partizan, he assisted on a Sébastien Squillaci goal in the team's 3–1 victory. In October 2010, Nasri went on a streak in which he scored goals in three-straight matches. He started the streak by converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. In the club's following match, against Shakhtar Donetsk, Nasri scored on a left-footed volley in a 5–1 victory. He also assisted on a goal in the match. Against Manchester City five days later, he scored the first goal and set up the third in a 3–0 victory. As a result of his performances in October 2010, Nasri was named the PFA Fans' Player of the Month. In November, Nasri was on the score-sheet again netting the opener in a 3–2 defeat to Tottenham. A week later, he scored a volley in a 4–2 win over Aston Villa.

On 4 December, Nasri scored two goals against Fulham to give Arsenal a 2–1 win. The victory placed Arsenal at the top of the league table. The two goals were Nasri's seventh and eighth goals, respectively, in the league and his tenth and 11th overall. Just four days later, Nasri scored a goal in Arsenal's vital last group match against Partizan, a 3–1 victory. On 13 December, for his performances during the 2010 calendar year, Nasri was named the "France Football" French Player of the Year, edging Chelsea midfielder Florent Malouda and Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. He became the first Arsenal player to achieve the honour since Thierry Henry in 2006. Nasri was also rewarded domestically for his performances in December, winning the Fans' Player of the Month for the second time in the season and also capturing the club's monthly award. He won the award for the second consecutive month in January.

Nasri scored his 13th goal of the season in the 3–0 win against Birmingham City on 1 January 2011. In the FA Cup, Nasri scored his first-ever goal in the competition in a 3–1 win over Leeds United in the third round. On 30 January, Nasri was forced to leave the team's fourth round FA Cup tie against Huddersfield Town due to a hamstring injury. He subsequently missed two weeks and returned to the team ahead of its Champions League knockout round tie with Spanish champions Barcelona. In the first leg, Nasri assisted the match-winning goal scored by Andrey Arshavin. Arsenal won the match 2–1, but lost the tie 4–3 on aggregate after suffering a 3–1 defeat at the Camp Nou in the second leg. On 8 April, Nasri was nominated for both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards. He lost out on both awards to Tottenham midfielder Gareth Bale and teammate Jack Wilshere, respectively, but was given consolation with an appearance on the association's Team of the Year.

Of his time at Emirates Stadium, Nasri has expressed deep admiration for his former manager Wenger, of whom he also described as a "role model" and a "magician". Altogther, Nasri scored 27 goals in 124 total appearances for Arsenal.

On 24 August 2011, it was confirmed Nasri had joined Premier League club Manchester City. The transfer fee was priced in the region of £25 million, and the player signed a four-year contract.

On 12 August, Nasri scored and assisted a goal in the 2012 Community Shield, a 3–2 win against FA Cup winners Chelsea. A week later, on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League, he scored and assisted again in a 3–2 win against newly promoted Southampton. He then scored against Ajax in a 3–1 loss in the UEFA Champions League group stage. In December 2012, Nasri was criticised for not blocking Robin van Persie's winning goal for Manchester United in the Manchester Derby.

In March 2013, after a man of the match performance in a 4–0 win against Newcastle United, Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini said he "would like to give [Nasri] a punch" due to his inconsistent form. On 14 April, Nasri scored the opening goal as City defeated Chelsea 2–1 in the FA Cup semi-final.

Nasri scored his first goal of the 2013–14 season in the match against Manchester United in a 4–1 win. On 5 November, he provided assists for goals by Sergio Agüero and Álvaro Negredo as City cruised by CSKA Moscow 5–2 to advance to the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time in club history. On 1 December, Nasri scored twice in a 3–0 win over Swansea City.

In a crucial Premier League match away to Everton on 3 May, Nasri provided the assist for Edin Džeko's game-winning goal as City came from behind to win 3–2 and go top of the table with two matches remaining. On 11 May, Nasri scored Manchester City's opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of West Ham United as the club won the 2013–14 Premier League title.

On 10 July 2014, Nasri signed a new five-year contract deal with Manchester City, which will keep him at the club until 2019.

On 22 November 2015, Manuel Pellegrini confirmed Nasri would miss four-to-five months of action because of a tendon injury sustained in training. On 10 April 2016, during his first match back from injury, he scored the match-winning goal against West Bromwich Albion as Manchester City won 2–1.

On 31 August 2016, Nasri joined Spanish club Sevilla on a season-long loan deal.

On 21 August 2017, Nasri signed for Turkish side Antalyaspor on a two-year contract for a reported €3.5 million transfer fee. On 31 January 2018, Nasri mutually terminated his contract with the club, having made eight appearances and scored two goals in the Süper Lig during his five-month stay.

On 22 February 2018, Nasri was given a six-month ban from football by UEFA, for breaching WADA rules in December 2016 by receiving an intravenous drip of 500 millilitres of water containing nutrients. On 1 August 2018, Nasri's ban was increased by an extra 12 months following an appeal from UEFA's ethics and disciplinary inspector. The ban was back-dated to 1 July 2017.

With his ban from football due to finish on 31 December 2018, Nasri began training with West Ham United and undertook a medical in the hopes of signing a short-term contract. When the sanction ended, Nasri signed a short-term deal with West Ham until the end of the 2018–19 season.

Nasri has earned caps with all of France's youth teams for which he was eligible. He is a member of the group, commonly known as the "Génération 1987" which produced internationals Hatem Ben Arfa, Karim Benzema and Jérémy Ménez, alongside himself. With the under-16 team, Nasri made 16 appearances and scored eight goals. Of the four players, Nasri was the first player to become a regular starter in the team under coach François Blaquart and made his debut in the team's opening match of the campaign against Spain. France won the match 3–0. Nasri scored his first goal for the team on 29 October in its first group stage match against Sweden at the "Tournoi du Val-de-Marne". On 11 December, Nasri scored the opening goal in the team's 6–1 defeat of Greece. At the 2003 Aegean Cup in Turkey, he scored two goals in four matches as France finished the competition in third place. Nasri scored in the team's second group stage match against Israel, a 3–1 win. In the next group stage match, he scored a goal in 5–0 win over the Ukraine. In the third place match against Belgium, Nasri assisted on a goal scored by Ben Arfa. At the Tournoi de Montaigu, Nasri scored his only goal in the team's 8–0 win over Gabon in the team's opening group match. France finished the competition runner-up to Italy, who defeated France 5–1 in the final match.

At under-17 level, Nasri, Menez and Ben Arfa were joined by Karim Benzema and tasked with the goal of winning the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship on home soil. Nasri made his debut with the team in the opening match of the season against Sweden, scoring a goal in a 5–2 victory. In the team's second straight yearly appearance at the "Tournoi du Val-de-Marne", Nasri scored his lone goal in the competition against the United States in a 2–0 win as France were declared champions without conceding a goal. At the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, Nasri scored against Portugal in the competition's semi-finals. France went on to win the match 3–1 to earn a place in the final. In the final match, France faced Spain. In the match, Nasri scored the game-winning goal to give France its first-ever title in the competition. In total with the under-17s, he made 16 appearances and scored six goals. Due to increased playing time at his parent club Marseille, Nasri's stint with the under-18 team was uneventful, appearing in only four matches.

The foursome of Nasri, Ben Arfa, Benzema and Ménez returned to international play together for under-19 duty. The four were joined by Issiar Dia, Blaise Matuidi and Serge Gakpé with the objective of winning the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. The team opened the campaign with two friendly matches against Norway. Over the course of the two matches, Nasri scored two goals: one in a 4–0 win and another in a 5–0 victory. In the first round of qualification for the tournament, Nasri assisted on two goals in the team's 3–1 win over Wales. In the team's next group stage match against San Marino, he scored the third goal in a 3–0 victory. In the final group match against Austria, Nasri scored the opening goal and provided the assist on a Benzema goal in a 2–0 win. In the final round of qualification, despite finishing the round undefeated, France were eliminated after being beaten on points by Scotland. Nasri earned his first call up to the under-21 team under coach René Girard in the team's first match following the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship against Belgium. He started the match and was replaced at half-time by Florent Sinama Pongolle. He featured in qualification matches for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and appeared as a substitute in both legs of the team's surprising defeat to Israel in the qualifying playoffs. Despite still being eligible to represent the team until 2009, his appearance in the second leg defeat to Israel was Nasri's last with the team.

On 15 March 2007, Nasri was called up to the senior team for the first time by coach Raymond Domenech for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against Lithuania and a friendly against Austria. Nasri said he was "very happy and very proud" to be called into the national team, stating that the call-up was all the more satisfying as the game was an important European Championship qualifier. He appeared on the bench in the match against Lithuania, but failed to make an appearance. Nasri made his international debut on 28 March against Austria at age 19. He started the match and was involved with the only goal, delivering the free-kick from which Karim Benzema scored. Nasri returned to the team in June for matches and, on 6 June, scored his first international goal in a 1–0 Euro qualifying win over Georgia. 

On 16 November 2007, Nasri scored his second international goal in a friendly match against Morocco. As a result of his performances, he was named in the 23-man squad to participate in Euro 2008. Nasri made his debut in the tournament on 9 June 2008 in the team's opening group stage match against Romania, appearing as a substitute. He did not appear in the team's 4–1 loss to the Netherlands, but did appear in the team's final group stage match against Italy. Nasri appeared as a substitute for the injured Franck Ribéry in the tenth minute. Following defender's Eric Abidal's red card in the 24th minute, Nasri was taken out of the match in order for defender Jean-Alain Boumsong to take Abidal's spot in the lineup.

In November 2008, Nasri was one of a group of young players who were accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at Euro 2008. The accusation came from domestic teammate William Gallas, who made the charge in his autobiography. Though not explicitly named in the book, Nasri was widely identified as the player in question. As an example of Nasri's disrespectful attitude, Gallas cited an incident in which the young player sat in Thierry Henry's seat on the team bus and refused to move, which, according to Gallas, undermined the striker's seniority. The incident ultimately led to a verbal exchange between Nasri and Gallas during a training session. In response, Nasri played down the incident, stating Gallas was overreacting to a problem that did not exist. In 2010, after failing to make the 2010 World Cup squad, Nasri opened up about the situation, stating that during Gallas' final year at Arsenal, Nasri was one of "four or five" Arsenal players who did not speak to the defender. The feud culminated on 20 November 2010 when Nasri lived up to a pledge he would not shake the hand of Gallas, who was then playing for Tottenham Hotspur, during the pre-match build-up.

In the 2008–09 season, Nasri appeared in only three matches with the national team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost a year and a half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I told myself I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one."

Nasri returned to the national team under the reign of new coach Laurent Blanc for the team's friendly against Norway on 11 August 2010. He missed the September call-ups due to injury before returning to the team in October for Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. On 25 March 2011, Nasri captained the national team for the first time in its 2–0 Euro qualification win over Luxembourg. He provided the assist on the opening goal scored by Philippe Mexès. In the team's final Euro qualifier against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nasri scored the equalizing goal, converting a penalty in a 1–1 draw. The point gained from the stalemate secured a Euro 2012 qualifying spot for France. After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Nasri was named to the squad to participate in the competition. In the team's opening group stage match against England, he scored the equalizing goal in a 1–1 draw.

After France lost to Spain in the quarter-finals, Nasri subjected a reporter to what was described as a "foul-mouthed tirade" when asked for his views on the match. For that and other misdemeanours, the French Football Federation (FFF) imposed a three-match international ban.

On 13 May 2014, France manager Didier Deschamps revealed his 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup, omitting Nasri.

On 9 August 2014, at age 27, Nasri confirmed his decision to retire from international football.

In his early years at Marseille, Nasri was deployed in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily on the right side as he was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally said that playing centrally is his preference. As a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.

In 2009, in order to accommodate the arrival of Russian attacker Andrey Arshavin, it was recommended by both Wenger and then-France national team coach Raymond Domenech that Nasri revert to his role as a deep-lying midfielder so the player could showcase his underrated defensive abilities. Nasri is also an underrated direct free kick and penalty kick taker. The player had previously developed a superstition with regards to taking spot kicks, but conquered the issue after successfully converting two penalties in the team's League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2010. Wenger describes Nasri as a "young, quick and technically outstanding player". He is described in a similar fashion by club scout Gilles Grimandi, who stated that Nasri is "a fantastic athlete, he's quick, flexible and good with his feet". Nasri's playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to Zinedine Zidane. After joining Arsenal and excelling on the wing, the English media began comparing him to former club player and compatriot Robert Pires.

Wilshere joined the Arsenal Academy in October 2001 at the age of nine, after a short spell in the Luton Town youth programme. He rose through the ranks, and at the age of 15 was named the captain of the under-16s; he also made a few appearances for the under-18s. In the summer of 2007, Wilshere featured in the Champions Youth Cup in Malaysia and upon his return to England, Arsenal Academy coach Steve Bould gave him a start for the under-18s first match against the Chelsea under-18 team. He scored his first goal against Aston Villa under-18s in a 4–1 win. He then scored a hat-trick against Watford under-18s, helping his side to an Academy Group A title. He finished his first full season with the under-18s with 13 goals in 18 appearances, most of which coming at age 15.

In February 2008, he made his debut for Arsenal Reserves aged 16 against Reading, and scored Arsenal's only goal of the match, which ended in a draw. He scored a memorable goal against West Ham reserves in March, picking the ball up and curling a shot into the top left corner under the watching eye of first-team manager Arsène Wenger. He managed to record two goals and two assists in just three appearances for the reserves at the end of the 2007–08 season. He played in the under-16s victory in the Ferroli Cup, being named as player of the tournament. He played an important role in Arsenal's 2009 FA Youth Cup win, scoring goals in the semi-final and producing a man-of-the-match display in the first leg of the final against Liverpool, assisting two goals and scoring himself.

Wenger gave Wilshere a place in Arsenal's first-team squad for the 2008–09 season, and he was given the number 19 shirt. He made his competitive debut in a Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in September 2008, as an 84th-minute substitute for Robin van Persie. At the age of 16 years and 256 days, he was Arsenal's youngest-ever league debutant, a record previously held by Cesc Fàbregas. Ten days later, on 23 September, Wilshere scored his first competitive Arsenal goal in a 6–0 victory against Sheffield United in the League Cup. On 25 November 2008, Wilshere came on as a substitute in a UEFA Champions League match against Dynamo Kyiv, becoming the fifth sixteen-year-old to ever play in the competition. In January 2009 Wilshere signed his first professional contract, extending it in July the same year.

In the preparation for the 2009–10 season, Wilshere scored twice and was twice awarded Man of the Match as Arsenal regained the friendly tournament, the Emirates Cup. On 22 September 2009, he started for Arsenal in their 2–0 League Cup win over West Bromwich Albion. In the 37th minute of the match, he was involved in a controversial incident with Jerome Thomas as Thomas pushed Wilshere's face and was shown a red card.

On 29 January 2010, Wilshere joined Premier League side Bolton Wanderers on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. He made his first league start in the away match at Manchester City on 9 February, and scored his first Bolton goal, his first in the Premier League, on 6 March 2010 in the 2–1 victory at West Ham United. He impressed at Bolton and they tried, unsuccessfully, to sign him on loan for another season.

Wilshere started the 2010–11 season by making his senior England debut in August, becoming the Three Lions' 10th youngest ever player. He also featured in all three of Arsenal's Premier League matches, starting in the 1–1 draw against Liverpool, the 6–0 win over Blackpool before coming on as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers, comprehensively displaying fine form. Wilshere continued his fine form through to October, however, his month was cut short with a red card in a 2–1 win against Birmingham City on 16 October. He was given his marching orders deep into injury time for a tackle on Nikola Žigić and missed the rest of the domestic month. However, Wilshere participated in European competition against Shakhtar Donetsk scored the Gunners' fourth goal on the night in a 5–1 win.

Wilshere was again a regular feature alongside Alex Song at the heart of the Arsenal midfield during the following months. The role meant he had the responsibility of protecting the Arsenal back four against Chelsea. Against the likes of Michael Essien and John Obi Mikel, the 18-year-old was praised for showing great physical strength during the match which Arsenal won 3–1. He made seven appearances during the month of January as he continued his partnership with Alex Song at the centre of Arsenal's midfield. This connection was as such displayed in that of the crunch match against Manchester United which was won 1–0. Then England manager Fabio Capello described him as "the future" and declared his intention to give him the 'holding role' for England after he watched the 19-year-old hold down a midfield place for Arsenal during the course of the season. Wilshere finished the season competing in all of Arsenal's final fixtures during May, making 49 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal.

During the summer leading into the 2011–12 season, Wilshere suffered a stress fracture ankle injury during an Emirates Cup pre-season friendly against New York Red Bulls, and during the first few months of the injury, Arsène Wenger said: "The news we have for Jack is very positive", he had said. "No [he will not be back sooner], we will respect the delays. I count maybe mid-February for Jack." Upon having successful ankle surgery, Wilshere's participation for Arsenal was minimum. Wenger further commented on his injury saying: "The first news we have had is better than expected," said Wenger. "He is not in a boot, but I don't know more. His morale looks quite good and I hope it will only be a short setback."

During further rehabilitation, it looked as if Wilshere would heal, with Wenger saying: "It is difficult to set a deadline on Jack," he said. "We go week by week with him. But his last scan was very good so we don’t have worry anymore. It is about progress and fitness, however, I can’t set a date."
However, Wilshere was ruled out of the remainder of the 2011–12 season. The injury meant that he did not participate in a single club match all season, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and England's UEFA Euro 2012 campaign, with Wenger ruling him out further saying: "His ankle is fine and he makes progress, but it is slow progress, [and] we had a chat about that. His progress is not quick enough to go to the Euros."

Wilshere continued his recovery from his ankle injury, which had ruled him out for the whole of the previous season. "We still have to assess them [him and Bacary Sagna] again after the international break," said Arsène Wenger. "After that they should not be too far away from normal training." He made his return to the first team, making his first Premier League start in 17 months (524 days), playing in the win over Queens Park Rangers. The 20-year-old made an immediate impact, producing a typically combative performance that saw him crowned Man of the Match. "It felt amazing to be back," Wilshere said. "All the hard work and long days at the training ground have paid off."

He continued to feature for Arsenal, and made six appearances in December, producing another Man of the Match performance against that of West Bromwich Albion. The young midfielder committed his long-term future to the club after signing a new contract, to the delight of Arsène Wenger, who said: "Jack is certainly the best known, the leader of this group [of young British players]. We're very happy that we could conclude their new deals at the same time."

Wilshere continued to produce excellent displays in the opening month of 2013, playing a part in all eight of Arsenal's matches and scoring the winner against Swansea City in the FA Cup.
His all-action performance against the Welsh side saw him win another Man of the Match award in that match. Meanwhile, Wilshere was given the captain's armband when regular skipper Thomas Vermaelen went off injured against West Ham. "[Wilshere] is naturally a guy who is not scared of anything on the football pitch and that is usually the sign of a leader," Wenger said. "He wants to win and shows you that. Of course he will be one of the leaders of this club – in fact he already is. A leader is somebody who does everything on the pitch to help his team to win. And he does that." He played the entirety of the North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur before picking up an injury that ruled him out of the month's remaining matches.

He was used as a substitute in all three of Arsenal's matches in May, making late appearances against QPR, Wigan Athletic and Newcastle United. "Jack will have a small, mild surgery [at the end of the season]," explained Arsène Wenger before the Wigan game. "It is a very small, small, small one. It is to remove a small pin. It will not be a problem. He will need very minor surgery, but we manage that as far as we can until the end of the season. At the moment, we use him only in games when I feel he is really needed."

Wilshere started the season playing on the left wing due to injuries keeping out Arsenal's first-team wingers such as Lukas Podolski, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott. He scored his first goal of the season on 6 October in a 1–1 draw away to West Bromwich Albion. He scored his second goal of the season on 19 October in a 4–1 win against Norwich City at the Emirates. And, on 26 November, he scored his first career brace in a 2–0 win against Olympique de Marseille in the UEFA Champions League, the first being the fastest European goal scored by an English player in Europe's top tier competition, which was timed at 29 seconds.

During a match against Manchester City on 14 December, Wilshere gave an abusive hand gesture and was given a two-match ban.

On 13 January, Wilshere played a part in both of Arsenal's goals against Aston Villa in a match which Arsenal won 2–1. Having scored in the 34th minute, Wilshere won the ball back from the kick-off and set up Olivier Giroud who scored Arsenal's second. Wilshere picked up his fourth assist of the season in Arsenal's 2–0 win over Fulham, on 18 January, setting up Santi Cazorla close to the hour mark. Wilshere featured for England's friendly against Denmark on 6 March. However, following a tackle from Daniel Agger, Wilshere was ruled out for just over six weeks after suffering a hairline fracture on his left foot, subsequently missing key Arsenal fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester City, along with missing a FA Cup semi-final against Wigan on 12 April. On 17 May, Wilshere came on as an extra-time substitute in the 2014 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Hull City 3–2 at Wembley Stadium for their first silverware since 2005.

On 28 May, Wilshere's goal against Norwich was voted BBC Goal of the Season with his goal accumulating 42% of the votes.

On 10 August, Wilshere started as Arsenal won the 2014 FA Community Shield by beating Manchester City 3–0. He scored and assisted in Arsenal's 2–2 home draw against the same team on 13 September.

On 27 November, Wilshere was ruled out for three months following surgery on his left ankle after injuring the ligaments in a 1–2 home defeat to Manchester United.

On 24 May 2015, Wilshere struck from outside the area as Arsenal defeated West Brom 4–1 to clinch a spot in the group stages of next season's UEFA Champions League. The goal would later be voted as the BBC Goal of the Season, making Wilshere the first player to win award in consecutive seasons since the start of the Premier League.

On 30 May, Wilshere came on as a substitute in the 2015 FA Cup Final, a 4–0 win over Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium. On Arsenal's victory parade after winning the final, he led fans in a chant calling local rivals Tottenham "shit". Having previously been warned by the FA after a similar chant in the previous season's campaign, he was charged with misconduct.

Wilshere broke his fibula during pre-season training in August, and was initially expected to be out for up to a few weeks. However, in September, he underwent surgery on his leg and was ruled out of action for a further 3 months. In February 2016, Wilshere stated that he was working to regain fitness, albeit slowly. He admitted to being frustrated by his injuries, but that he was still motivated to return to the pitch. On 8 April 2016 Wilshere returned to pitch after about 10 months as he started for the U-21 side against Newcastle and scored his first goal after coming back from injury against West Brom U-21 about two weeks later. On 24 April Wilshere returned to the Arsenal line up against Sunderland and returned to pitch on the 84th minute replacing Mesut Özil.

On 31 August 2016, Wilshere completed a season long loan move to AFC Bournemouth for the 2016–17 season and was given the number 32 which was previously worn by midfielder Eunan O'Kane. On 10 September 2016, Wilshere played his first match for Bournemouth as a 63rd-minute substitute against West Bromwich Albion as they won 1–0. Wilshere then won consecutive Player of the Month awards for Bournemouth for November and December 2016. On 15 April 2017, Wilshere suffered a hairline fracture to his left fibula after his clash with Harry Kane in a match against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. On 19 April 2017, it was confirmed that Wilshere would miss the rest of the season after making 29 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth and would be treated back at Arsenal.

During the summer leading into the 2017–18 season, various clubs showed interest in signing the midfielder but by mid-August, Wenger confirmed he had plans for him this season. On 15 September, he made his first appearance for Arsenal since August 2016 as a substitute in the second half against FC Köln in the Europa League. On 20 September, Wilshere made his first start in over 16 months against Doncaster Rovers and played for the full 90 minutes.

On 22 October, he played his first Premier League match of the season as a substitute in a 5–2 win over Everton at Goodison Park, assisting a goal for Aaron Ramsey. On 7 December, Wilshere scored his first Arsenal goal in 928 days as the Gunners defeated BATE Borisov 6–0 in the Europa League.

Wilshere's performances in the Europa League group stage and an injury to Ramsey saw him start in the Premier League for Arsenal for the first time since May 2016 in the team's 0–0 draw with West Ham United on 13 December 2017. It was also the first time he had completed the full 90 minutes in the Premier League for the club since September 2014. On 3 January 2018, in his sixth consecutive Premier League start, Wilshere scored his first Premier League goal for two and a half years in a 2–2 home draw with London rivals Chelsea.

On 19 June 2018, Wilshere announced that he would be leaving Arsenal, with his contract due to expire at the end of the month.

Wilshere signed for Premier League club West Ham United on 9 July 2018 on a three-year contract. He made his debut on 12 August in a 4–0 defeat by Liverpool.

Since 2006, the England national team played Wilshere in an age group above his age. Wilshere was just 14 when he played for the England national under-16 team at the Victory Shield in 2006.
At the age of 15, he began playing for the England national under-17 team. He was then named in the squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in May, starting the first two matches, particularly impressing in the second match against Germany before going off with an injury which kept him out of the final match. After the tournament, he was named among the 10 future stars from the tournament.

On 11 September 2009, he also came on as substitute for his England under-21 debut against the Netherlands in a 0–0 draw.

On 7 August 2010, Wilshere was called up to the England senior team for the first time for their friendly against Hungary. He made his England debut in the match played on 11 August 2010, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Steven Gerrard. This made him the 10th youngest player ever to play for England, at the age of 18 years and 222 days.

On 9 February 2011, Wilshere made his full England debut when he started in a friendly against Denmark. He impressed despite playing in an unfamiliar role just in front of the defence and was praised by manager Fabio Capello.
On 25 March 2011, Wilshere made his competitive debut for England in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Wales at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. He made one further appearance in the qualifying phase but missed the tournament finals due to injury.

On 6 February 2013, Wilshere made his first start for England since 2011 due to injury, and was named man-of-the-match as England beat Brazil 2–1 at Wembley Stadium. Wilshere's performance was widely praised by many including manager Roy Hodgson, captain Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard. He was part of England's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in England's opening match against Italy. He started the final group match against Costa Rica, with England already eliminated from the competition.

Wilshere was awarded Man of the match in six out of seven UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches. His first England goals came on his 28th appearance on 14 June 2015, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match away to Slovenia, netting two long-range strikes as they came from behind to win 3–2 at the Stožice Stadium in Ljubljana.

Wilshere was selected for the 2018 friendlies in preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 16 May 2018, he was left out Gareth Southgate's 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Wilshere is known for his movement, vision, passing and combination play, as well as his leadership on the pitch. He has been described by Arsène Wenger as having "Spanish technique, but an English heart." Owen Coyle, the manager of Bolton during Wilshere's loan spell at the club, praised his ability to "tackle and take a knock," despite his lack of height. However, Arsenal head of youth development Liam Brady noted that Wilshere had problems with his temper early on in his career.

Wilshere has been played in many different positions, including as an attacking midfielder, a Winger, and most regularly, as a deep-lying central midfielder. Wenger has said that Wilshere is "a box-to-box player, more than just a holding midfielder." Wilshere's style of play has frequently been compared to that of former Arsenal midfielder Liam Brady, while Brady himself identified Wilshere as the latest in a line of technically gifted English players from Glenn Hoddle to Wayne Rooney.

Following his return from injury in the 2012–13 season, Wilshere received praise for his performances and potential from a number of respected players: Barcelona and Brazil defender Dani Alves referred to Wilshere as "a great player," and compared his potential to that of Barcelona legends Andrés Iniesta and Xavi; Former Manchester United and Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger called Wilshere "one of the best players there are" at his position; and Borussia Dortmund and Germany forward Marco Reus hailed him as "a perfect player." 

Former Italy international and current AC Milan manager Gennaro Gattuso said of Wilshere: "He might be not super fast but he’s got great skills, he’s very technical. When he gets the ball he knows exactly where to send it...He has the mentality of an English player but plays like a Spanish player".

Wilshere has stated that his ambition is to eventually captain both Arsenal and England; Arsène Wenger has tipped him for both. Former England manager Roy Hodgson has said, "Wilshere has got the personality, the character and the quality to accept responsibility, to accept the pressure. I foresee a fantastic England career for him. I would agree with Arsène Wenger and say Jack has got the qualities [to be England captain], there's no doubt about that."

Wilshere was arrested in the early hours of the morning on 29 August 2010 in connection with a "fracas". However, it appeared Wilshere played the role of peacemaker and so did not face charges but received a caution. In March 2011, Wilshere received a police warning for spitting on a taxi driver, who happened to be wearing a hat of Arsenal's rivals Tottenham, after the driver refused to drive him home because he was too drunk.

On 26 September 2013, Neal gave birth to their second child, Delilah Grace Wilshere. 

Wilshere appeared on the UK and Ireland cover of "FIFA 12" alongside Wayne Rooney. On 16 December 2014 Wilshere announced his support for the UNHCR in their fundraising drive to aid inhabitants of the Philippines affected by the Hainan Typhoon.

On 2 September 2011, in an international friendly against Uruguay in Kharkiv, Yarmolenko set a national team record by scoring 14 seconds into the match, the fastest time in which a Ukraine national team player has scored a goal.

Yarmolenko scored a hat-trick on 15 November 2014, netting all of Ukraine's goals in a 3–0 victory away to Luxembourg in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. In November 2015, Yarmolenko scored in both legs of Ukraine's 3–1 play-off victory over Slovenia to qualify the nation for Euro 2016 final stages.

Angelo Ogbonna

Obinze Angelo Ogbonna (born 23 May 1988), known as Angelo Ogbonna, is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a centre back for English West Ham United and the Italian national team.

He signed for Torino in 2002, having previously been a member of Nuova Cassino's youth set-up. Ogbonna made his debut in Serie A at the age of 18 under Alberto Zaccheroni. After a loan spell at Crotone in Serie C1, he returned to Torino, with whom he played for a further five seasons. In July 2013, he transferred to city rivals, Juventus, winning the "Scudetto" in
2013–14 and 2014–15, as well as the 2013 Supercoppa Italiana and the 2014–15 Coppa Italia.

He was a member of the Italian side which finished runners-up at UEFA Euro 2012, and also represented his nation at UEFA Euro 2016.

Ogbonna began his early career in the youth set-up of Cassino, where he played as a central defender. In 2002, he was noticed by Torino, which, on the recommendation of Antonio Comi, bought him for €3,000 and assigned him to their youth team. In the 2006–07 season he was regularly called up to the first team and on 11 February 2007 he made his debut in Serie A at age 18, against Reggina (1–2), as a starter under coach Alberto Zaccheroni. At the end of season he totalled 4 league appearances.

The following August he moved on loan to Crotone in Serie C1, making 22 league appearances in the league and narrowly earning promotion to Serie B, lost in the semi-final play-offs.

In the 2008–09 Serie A season he returned to Torino, collecting 19 league appearances and four in Coppa Italia. Torino, however, were relegated to Serie B at the end of the season. Starting from 2009, after the relegation of the club to Serie B, he earned his place as a starter for the "Granata". On 17 April 2010, Ogbonna scored his first goal for Torino in the match against Cesena, finishing 1–1.

On 2 February 2012, he renewed his contract with Torino until 30 June 2016.

On 11 July 2013, Ogbonna underwent a medical at Turin's Fornaca, Isokinetic and the Istituto di Medicina dello Sport ahead of his proposed cross-town move to Juventus. After passing the medical, he officially signed for Juventus for a transfer fee of €13 million, with an additional €2 million to be paid in future bonuses. He became the first player to become captain of the "Granata" and transfer to rivals Juventus, sparking much dislike with his old supporters of Torino.

He made his Champions League debut in on 17 September 2013, against F.C. Copenhagen. In his first season, despite being behind Andrea Barzagli, Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini in the pecking order at centre back, Ogbonna managed 25 appearances in all competitions, mostly starting in matches in the latter half of the season as the team was heavily rotated for league, Coppa Italia and Champions League matches. Ogbonna played 16 league games for Juventus in the 2013–14 season, as they won Serie A title. He was also a member of the side which won the 2013 Supercoppa Italiana In the 2014–15 season, Juventus defended the Serie A title once again, with Ogbonna making 25 league appearances, and the 2014–15 Coppa Italia. On 6 June 2015, he was an unused substitute as Juventus lost the Champions League Final 3–1 to Barcelona in Berlin.

On 10 July 2015, Ogbonna joined Premier League club West Ham United, on a four-year contract, for €11 million to be spread over the next three financial years. He made his debut 20 days later in the Europa League third qualifying round, starting against Astra Giurgiu; in the 82nd minute he netted an own goal equaliser as West Ham drew 2–2 at the Boleyn Ground. On 9 February 2016, Ogbonna scored his first goal for the club, netting an injury-time match-winning header in the 121st minute of a 2–1 home win over Liverpool, in the fourth round FA Cup replay.

Having played 18 of a possible 22 Premier League games for West Ham in the 2016–17 season, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season as he required an operation. West Ham manager, Slaven Bilić, said that Ogbonna had played every game of the season despite carrying the injury. He returned for the final game of the 2016–17 season, a 2–1 away win against Burnley. In June 2017, Ogbonna signed a new contract with West Ham committing him to the club until 2022.

On 12 August 2009, he made his debut with the Italian under-21 team in a friendly game against Russia.

Ogbonna made his senior debut on 11 November 2011 in a 2–0 friendly victory against Poland, where he came on as a substitute for Domenico Criscito in the 77th minute.

Ogbonna was included by manager Cesare Prandelli in the Italian 23-man final squad for Euro 2012, but did not play during the competition.

In May 2016, Ogbonna was included in the provisional 30-man Italy squad for Euro 2016; On 31 May 2016, he was named in Antonio Conte's final 23-man squad for the tournament. Ogbonna made his only appearance of the tournament on 22 June, in Italy's final group match, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Ireland.

Ryan Fredericks

Ryan Marlowe Fredericks (born 10 October 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a full-back for Premier League club West Ham United. He has previously played for Tottenham Hotspur, Brentford, Millwall, Middlesbrough, Bristol City and Fulham.

Born in Hammersmith, London, Fredericks joined the Tottenham academy in July 2009. Although he was injured early in his career, he progressed through the academy to sign a professional contract with the club in July 2010. In July 2011, Fredericks was awarded a new contract at the club.

Fredericks first appeared in Tottenham's first team as an unused substitute in February 2010, in an FA Cup fourth round replay win over Leeds United. A year later, Fredericks started his first game for Tottenham on 25 August 2011, against Hearts, where he played on the right of midfield. He made his debut alongside Tom Carroll and Harry Kane. Fredericks then made his first Tottenham Hotspur appearance in two years, making a start, in the last group stage game of Europa League, where he won a penalty to allow Roberto Soldado converted the penalty successfully to score a hat-trick, in a 4–1 win over Anzhi Makhachkala on 12 December 2013. In January 2014, Fredericks signed a contract with Tottenham Hotspur that would keep him at the club until 2016.

On 10 August 2012, he signed on loan for League One club Brentford. He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat against Walsall in the League Cup. He made his league debut on 18 August, in a 0–0 draw against Bury. He made his home debut on 22 September, in a 1–0 win against Oldham Athletic. Tottenham exercised the right to recall Fredericks to the Tottenham squad on 25 October 2012. Reflecting about his time at Brentford, Fredericks said the move benefited, as the player he is today.

On 17 January 2014, he switched to Championship side Millwall for a three-month loan. He made his début the following day, a home match against Ipswich Town, where he scored the only goal of the game with a lob from the right back position. After two appearances, Fredericks' loan spell at Millwall was extended until the end of the season. Fredericks became a first team regular at Millwall in the right-back position, making 14 appearances.

On 28 August 2014, Fredericks joined Middlesbrough for a season-long loan. However, he remained on the sidelines until he was called up to the first team by manager Aitor Karanka following Damià Abella's injury. His league debut came on 20 September 2014, where he played 90 minutes against former club Brentford and saw Middlesbrough win 4–0. He suffered a thigh injury during a match against Blackburn Rovers, and was sidelined for a month. He made his first appearance after returning from injury in a 1–0 win over Brentford on 31 January 2015. After appearing six times in nine appearance between February and March, Fredericks suffered a hamstring injury, which he sustained during a match against Nottingham Forest on 7 March 2015. After returning to training in early-April, Fredericks remained on the sidelines until 25 April 2015, playing the first hour of a 4–3 loss to Fulham. Despite being sidelined, Fredericks went on to make 17 appearances for Middlesbrough before returning to his parent club.

On 6 August 2015, Fredericks joined Bristol City on a permanent transfer, signing a three-year contract, and was given the number twelve shirt ahead of the new season. Fredericks stated the club's "open and attacking" football was his motivation for joining. Fredericks made his Bristol City debut, in the opening game of the season, where he played as a right-midfield before switching to left-midfield, in a 2–0 loss away at Sheffield Wednesday.
However, after just twenty-six days at the club and making only five appearance in all competitions for the club, it was reported that Fredericks was on the verge of leaving Bristol City, citing personal reasons and that he would be returning to London to an unnamed side, which was later to be revealed as Fulham.

He joined Championship club Fulham on a three-year contract on 31 August 2015, with the fee undisclosed.

Fredericks made his Fulham debut, coming on as a substitute for Ben Pringle in the 62nd minute, in a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers on 13 September 2015. He started out, playing in the right–back position for the next two matches before playing in the right–midfield position (whenever he came on as a substitute). For the rest of the season, Fredericks continued to play in either the right–back position and right–midfield position. Despite suffering injuries during the 2015–16 season Fredericks went on to make 36 appearances for Fulham in his first season. 

In the 2016–17 season, Fredericks spent the start of the season with ankle injury and was sidelined between 10–12 weeks following surgery. It wasn’t until on 18 October 2016 when he returned to the first team from injury, starting the match in the right–back position, in a 2–2 draw against Norwich City. Since returning from injury, he regained his first team place, in the right–back position. In a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 10 December 2016, Fredericks played a role for Fulham when he set up two goals, resulting a 4–4 draw. Seven days later, on 17 December 2016, he provided another assist in a match against Derby County, setting up a goal for Floyd Ayité, in a 2–2 draw. Three weeks later, on 8 January 2017, Fredericks played another role against Cardiff City in the third round of the FA Cup when he set up the equaliser, in a 2–1 win; his performance earned him Man of the Match. However, in a match against Birmingham City on 4 February 2017, he was sent–off for a late tackle on Craig Gardner, in a 1–0 loss. After serving a three match suspension, Fredericks continued to regain his first team place in the right–back position for the rest of the season. He also played in both legs of the play-offs, which saw Reading won 2–1 on aggregate. Throughout the season, Fredericks’ performance was praised, due to his passing stats and pace. At the end of the 2016–17 season, he went on to make 34 appearances in all competitions.

In the 2017–18 season, Fredericks continued to regain his first team place in the right–back position at the start of the season. After going on three league matches without a win, he then played a role when he set up a goal for Neeskens Kebano, in a 2–1 win over Ipswich Town on 26 August 2017. Two weeks later, on 13 September 2017, Fredericks provided his second assists this season, setting up the winning goal, in a 2–1 win over Hull City. He was an ever present in the first team since the start of the 2017–18 season until he suffered a foot injury that saw him missed one game. After returning from injury against Aston Villa on 21 October 2017, he continued to regain his first team place. His performance at Fulham this season attracted from clubs, such as, Swansea City and Stoke City, but stayed at the club throughout January. His contributions led Fulham reaching the play–offs and subsequently ended up reaching the Premier League after beating Aston Villa 1–0 in the final, where he started and played 83 minutes before being substituted. For his performance, Fredericks was named in the EFL Championship team of the year in April 2018, along with teammate Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney. He’s also being named for the Championship Team of the Season. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Fredericks went on to make 48 appearances in all competitions.

With his contract at Fulham expected to expire at the end of the 2017–18 season, Fredericks hinted about staying at Fulham.

Arthur Masuaku

Fuka-Arthur Masuaku Kawela (born 7 November 1993), known as Arthur Masuaku, is a French-born Congolese professional footballer who plays for English club West Ham United and the DR Congo national team as a wing-back or left back. He began his senior career with Valenciennes, and has also played for Olympiacos. He has represented France at youth level.

Masuaku came through the youth system of Valenciennes. He made his Ligue 1 debut on the opening game of the 2013–14 season on 10 August 2013 against Toulouse. He was substituted after 75 minutes for Tongo Doumbia. On 29 January 2014 Masuaku scored his first competitive goal for Valenciennes in a 2–1 away defeat against Marseille.

In July 2014, Masuaku signed for Olympiacos. He made his Superleague debut against Niki Volos, and in his third league match he provided two assists against OFI Crete in a 3–0 home win. Three days later he made his debut and scored in the UEFA Champions League competition against Atlético Madrid in a 3–2 home win.

In April and May 2015, interest from Roma, Internazionale and Juventus was reported. His agent, Roger Henrotay, however stated a renewal of Masuaku's contract was on the cards. In July, a reported €4 million offer for Masuaku including former Olympiacos midfielder Giannis Fetfatzidis from Genoa was rejected by the club.

On 8 August 2016, Masuaku joined West Ham United on a four-year contract for a £6.2 million fee. He made his West Ham debut in a 2-1 away defeat to Chelsea on 15 August 2016. Masuaku admitted that he found his Premier League debut very tough due to the pace and physicality of the league. He scored his first goal for West Ham in an EFL Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers on 19 September 2017.

In the FA Cup fourth round game against Wigan Athletic on 27 January 2018 Masuaku was sent off for spitting at Wigan's Nick Powell following a challenge. It was the first sending-off of Masuaku's career. Musuaku apologised for the sending off, saying the incident was "totally unacceptable and out of character". He received a six match ban for the offence.

Having represented France at under-18 and under-19 level, Masuaku switched his allegiance to DR Congo in June 2017. In August 2017, he was called into his first DR Congo squad, for two 2018 World Cup qualification games against Tunisia. In March 2018, still yet to make his international debut, Masuaku travelled with the DR Congo squad for a friendly against Tanzania. He was one of four players to drop out before the game, amidst claims of organisational problems and travel disorder, and did not appear. He made his debut on 13 October 2018, starting in a 1–2 home loss against Zimbabwe in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game.

Lucas Pérez

Lucas Pérez Martínez (, born 10 September 1988) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward for English club West Ham United.

After spending the first years of his career in the lower leagues, only appearing sporadically for the first team of Rayo Vallecano in the Segunda División, he first made a name for himself with Karpaty Lviv in the Ukrainian Premier League. In 2013, he signed with PAOK from Greece, and later returned to La Liga with Deportivo, where he amassed a total of 93 matches and 32 goals; subsequently, he represented English clubs Arsenal and West Ham United in the Premier League.

Pérez was born in A Coruña, Galicia. After appearing for three clubs as a youth he moved to Madrid and joined Atlético Madrid's C-team, playing two seasons in Tercera División. In summer 2009 he signed with Rayo Vallecano, helping the reserves promote from the same level in his first year.

In the 2010–11 season, Pérez contributed with five games and one goal (in a 3–0 home win against Real Valladolid on 6 November 2010) as Rayo returned to La Liga after eight years. He continued to be mainly registered with the B side, however.

On 5 July 2013, Pérez signed on a fee of €700,000 a three-year contract with Superleague Greece team PAOK FC. He scored his first competitive goal on 17 August, contributing to a 3–0 home success over Skoda Xanthi FC, and on 24 November he equalised in a 3–1 win over Aris Thessaloniki F.C. in the Derby of Northern Greece; he also helped to a runner-up run in the national cup, losing the decisive match to Panathinaikos FC.

On 18 July 2014, Pérez returned to Spain and joined his newly promoted hometown side Deportivo de La Coruña in a one-year loan deal, with a buyout clause. He scored in his first official appearance, having started in a 3–0 home win against Valencia CF on 19 October which also marked his La Liga debut; the following matchday he was replaced in the 15th minute of a 0–0 away draw against RCD Espanyol, due to a knee injury.

Pérez only returned to action in January of the following year, appearing 12 minutes in a 0–4 home loss against FC Barcelona. On 23 May, against the same opponent at the Camp Nou, he helped "Dépor" come from behind by scoring in the 67th minute of a 2–2 draw in the last round that prevented relegation.

On 23 July 2015, in his first competitive match upon his return to PAOK, against NK Lokomotiva for the second preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League, Pérez scored the opener after Róbert Mak's shot was saved, in an eventual 6–0 home success. One week later, against FC Spartak Trnava for the same competition, he netted the game's only goal in the first leg.

On 12 August 2015, Pérez signed a permanent four-year deal with Deportivo. On 12 December, he took his season tally to 11 goals in only 15 games, helping to a 2–2 draw at Barcelona.

Pérez totalled a career-best 17 goals at the end of the campaign, eventually helping his team escape relegation again.

On 27 August 2016, Arsène Wenger said that Pérez had completed a medical examination in order to join Arsenal after the paperwork was done. Three days later the transfer was confirmed by the club, for a reported fee of £17.1 million. He made his competitive debut in the 2–1 Premier League home win over Southampton on 10 September, which coincided with both his birthday and that of teammate Laurent Koscielny, whom he assisted for his team's equaliser.

On 20 September 2016, during an EFL Cup away match against Nottingham Forest, Pérez scored his first goals for the Gunners, grabbing a brace in an eventual 4–0 triumph for the third round.

Towards the end of the month, he provided an assist to Danny Welbeck's first-ever brace for Arsenal, in a 5–0 away win against Southampton in the FA Cup.

On 31 August 2017, Pérez rejoined Deportivo on a season-long loan deal.

On 9 August 2018, Pérez signed a three-year contract with West Ham United for a reported fee of £4 million. He made his league debut for his new club nine days later, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute for Mark Noble in a 1–2 home loss to Bournemouth. He scored his first goal for them on 26 September, in their 8–0 win against Macclesfield Town in the EFL Cup.

On 4 December 2018, Pérez scored his first league goals for 700 days: coming on for Marko Arnautović, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win against Cardiff City, becoming the first West Ham player to achieve the feat as a substitute since Paulo Wanchope in 2000.

Michail Antonio

Michail Gregory Antonio (born 28 March 1990) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club West Ham United.

Antonio began his career at non-League club Tooting & Mitcham United before going on to represent a number of Football League clubs, including Reading, Cheltenham Town, Southampton, Colchester United, Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest.

Antonio was born in Wandsworth, London. He started his career at Tooting & Mitcham United Juniors at the age of 12 and remained there for six seasons. The Juniors' team was independent from Tooting & Mitcham United, whom he signed for at the age of 17 years. He made his debut for the club in an away match with Hendon at the age of 17, scoring to level scores at 1–1.

Antonio signed for Championship club Reading on 28 October 2008 for an undisclosed fee, signing a deal until 2010. He rejoined Tooting on a month-long loan spell on 9 January 2009, with the loan extended for a further month on 11 February but he returned to Reading less than a week later on 17 February after being recalled by the club.

Following his loan spell with Southampton in the summer of 2010, Antonio signed a fresh deal to keep him at Reading until 2013. He featured more regularly in the squad during the 2010–11 season, scoring one goal, against Burnley, in 24 appearances in all competitions.

After being recalled from Tooting, Antonio was subsequently loaned out to League One club Cheltenham Town on a month's loan, commencing on 19 February.

He made his Football League debut in a 2–0 defeat to Leeds United on 21 February, being substituted on 28 minutes after suffering from an ankle injury. After spending some time out injured, Antonio would go on to make eight further appearances until the end of the season with Cheltenham.

Southampton signed Antonio on loan for one month on 5 October 2009, making his debut on 9 October in a 3–1 away win at Southend United. He scored his first goal for Southampton in the FA Cup victory over Bristol Rovers on 6 November. The loan was subsequently extended until the end of the season.

He scored in the first leg of the Football League Trophy area final against Milton Keynes Dons, with the match finishing 1–0. He also scored in his next appearance, a 2–1 victory over Ipswich Town in the FA Cup. He scored again in the 4–1 2010 Football League Trophy Final win over Carlisle United at Wembley Stadium on 28 March 2010, which was his 20th birthday, bringing Antonio his first silverware.

Antonio's loan deal finished at the end of the 2009–10 season, but both manager Alan Pardew and Antonio himself expressed a desire for the winger to remain at Southampton.

Colchester United was the next destination for Antonio, where he signed on a one-month loan on 15 August 2011. He made his debut for the club the following day in a 2–0 home defeat to Charlton Athletic. He scored his first goal for the club to put the U's 2–1 ahead as they eventually lost in a 3–2 defeat to Huddersfield Town on 20 August. His loan spell with the club was extended for another month in September and then for a further month in October. In total, Antonio scored four goals in 15 league outings for Colchester.

On 21 February 2012, Sheffield Wednesday signed Antonio on an emergency loan deal until the end of the season. His debut for the Owls came in a 1–0 victory over local rivals, Sheffield United on 26 February. In his next appearance, a 4–1 win against Bury, he scored two and set up another for forward Ryan Lowe. In the following match, against Bournemouth, Antonio set up the opener and scored Wednesday's third in the opening ten minutes. Against Carlisle United at Hillsborough, he scored a 95th-minute winner to beat them and put Sheffield Wednesday only one point behind local rivals United, who were in second place. He helped the Owls to promotion on the final day of the season by scoring the first in a 2–0 victory over already relegated Wycombe Wanderers, which led Wednesday to finish above Steel city rivals Sheffield United.

Antonio signed on a permanent basis for Sheffield Wednesday on 6 August 2012 on a four-year deal after a third and final bid for the player was accepted by Reading. In his first season with the club, Antonio had been leading the scoring charts with nine goals, but an injury suffered in a 2–0 defeat by Cardiff City on 16 March 2013 ruled him out for the rest of the season.

On 6 August 2014, Antonio signed a three-year contract with Nottingham Forest for a transfer fee in the region of £1.5 million.

Antonio's strong form in Forest's first five league matches of the season, in which he contributed three goals and three assists, led to him being named as a candidate for the Championship's Player of the Month award for August. Antonio lost out on the award to Charlton's Igor Vetokele. Antonio started every league match for Forest during his first season with the club, scoring 14 goals, and was named Forest's Player of the Season on 4 May 2015.

On 11 August 2015, Antonio scored a brace in a 3–4 loss to League One club Walsall in the first round of the League Cup. On 15 August, the winger scored the winner in a 2–1 victory at home to Rotherham to open his tally for the new season.

Having already rejected a bid of £4 million from West Bromwich Albion for the transfer of Antonio earlier that summer, Forest received a second bid of £4 million from arch-rivals Derby County. Consequently, Antonio was left out of Forest's Championship match against Charlton Athletic on 19 August 2015, with his manager Dougie Freedman citing that the winger was not "in the right frame of mind" to play. However, Antonio returned for the next league match at Bolton Wanderers. On 26 August, West Ham United joined the bidding for Antonio, offering Forest £4 million and winger Matt Jarvis on a season-long loan.

On 1 September 2015, Antonio signed for Premier League club West Ham United for around £7 million on a four-year contract with an option for a further two years. He made his debut on 19 September, replacing Victor Moses in the 60th minute of West Ham's 2–1 Premier League win at Manchester City. In a Man of the match performance on 28 December 2015 in a 2–1 win, Antonio scored his first goal for West Ham. With the team losing 1–0 to Southampton, Antonio equalised when a clearance hit him and looped over Southampton goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg.

On 27 February, Antonio scored the only goal in a home win over Sunderland. He celebrated by lying on his side and spinning in a circle, imitating a celebration by "The Simpsons" character Homer Simpson in the episode "Last Exit to Springfield". In his next appearance, Antonio turned-in a Man of the match performance, scoring the only goal in a home win against Tottenham Hotspur. He followed this with another goal in a 3–2 away win at Everton three days later as West Ham came from two goals down. In July 2016, Antonio signed a new, four-year contract with West Ham.

Antonio started West Ham's first match of the 2016–17 season in the right-back position, subsequently giving away a penalty in the early stages of the second half, which was converted by Eden Hazard, to give Chelsea a 1–0 lead. He was substituted not long after for Sam Byram. Chelsea went on to win 2–1. In the second match of the season, on 21 August 2016, Antonio returned to his favourite position of Winger. He scored the only goal of the match, from a cross by Gökhan Töre, in a 1–0 win against Bournemouth; West Ham's first Premier League match and goal at their new ground, the London Stadium. In April 2017, having scored nine goals for West Ham, Antonio was ruled out for the remainder of the season with what was described by manager, Slaven Bilic, as a "significant injury". For his performances during the 2016–17 season, Antonio was named Hammer of the Year. On 11 May 2017, West Ham announced that Antonio had signed a new, four-year contract.

In March 2016, Antonio revealed that he had rejected the opportunity to play for Jamaica internationally and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England.

On 28 August 2016, in new England manager Sam Allardyce's first squad, Antonio was called up for the first time, for a 2018 World Cup qualification match against Slovakia in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 where he was an unused substitute. On 16 March 2017, Antonio was called up by new England manager Gareth Southgate's squad for the friendly match against Germany on 22 March and the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Lithuania on 26 March, however, on 20 March, Antonio withdrew from the squad after picking up a hamstring injury.

In February 2019, Antonio suggested that clubs whose fans engage in racial abuse should be deducted points.

On 12 January 2019, Rice scored his first goal for West Ham and was named man of the match in a 1–0 win against Arsenal, in West Ham's 50th Premier League game at the London Stadium.

Although born in London, Rice was eligible to play for Ireland as his grandparents are from Cork. On 19 March 2017, Rice was named Republic of Ireland U17 player of the year.

In August 2018, Rice was omitted from the squad to play Wales by manager Martin O'Neill, who said that Rice was considering switching to play for England after being approached by them. By November 2018, having been omitted from three squads selected by O'Neill, Rice said he was no closer in deciding whether to play for Ireland or England. In December 2018, Rice met with new Ireland manager Mick McCarthy and his assistant, Robbie Keane. McCarthy said that Rice was a potential future captain of Ireland and that he would build the team around Rice should he decide to play for the country.

On 13 February 2019, Rice pledged his future to England. On 5 March, his change of allegiance was confirmed by FIFA. On 13 March, he was called-up by England for their forthcoming UEFA Euro 2020 qualification matches against the Czech Republic and Montenegro.

Jordan Hugill

Jordan Thomas Hugill (born 4 June 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for EFL Championship club Middlesbrough, on loan from Premier League club West Ham United.

A relative late comer to the professional game, he had spells with non-league sides Seaham Red Star, Consett, Whitby Town and Marske United, and also spent time at the then Glenn Hoddle Academy club Jerez Industrial in Spain. He was signed by Port Vale in June 2013, and made his debut for the club four months later following a productive loan spell at Gateshead. He signed with Preston North End in June 2014. He was loaned out to Tranmere Rovers in February 2015 and then Hartlepool United the following month. He was signed by Premier League side West Ham United in January 2018 for an undisclosed fee. He returned to the Championship the following transfer window in a season-long loan to Middlesbrough.

Hugill, who was a pupil at Nunthorpe School, attended George Smith's academy in Hemlington from the age of nine. He began his career with Northern League club Seaham Red Star at the age of 16, and was due to go on trial at Sunderland before he was struck down with an ankle injury in September 2009. He later moved on to Consett, but left his contract in August 2010 to spend two years at the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain.

He signed with Whitby Town in December 2011 and scored in his debut game against Nantwich Town, only to damage his anterior cruciate ligament later in the match and spend the next ten months out injured. He joined Marske United in October 2012 initially on loan so as to regain match fitness. His last appearance for Marske came in the final of the North Riding Senior Cup, where they were beaten 3–0 by Pickering Town. During his time at the club he worked as a barman at the "Dickens Inn" in Middlesbrough.

Hugill signed with League One club Port Vale in June 2013. He was loaned out to Gateshead of the Conference Premier on 20 September 2013. "Tynesiders" boss Gary Mills stated that Hugill was a "talented... goalscorer" and put him in the starting line-up for the next match. He scored his first goal for the club on 24 September in a 3–2 win over Chester at the Gateshead International Stadium. He finished his loan spell with five goals in four starts and three substitute appearances.

He made his debut for the "Valiants" on 22 October, and played the first 75 minutes of a 3–0 victory over Crawley Town. He performed well on his debut, justifying his manager's surprise decision to play him alongside fellow Glenn Hoddle Academy graduate Ben Williamson in place of established strikers Tom Pope and Lee Hughes.

He scored his first Football League goal on 16 November, scoring the final goal of a 3–1 victory over Shrewsbury Town at Vale Park; after the match Adams said that the club had "unearthed a gem" in Hugill. Hugill continued to turn out for the first team, but admitted that he needed to work on his fitness to play a full 90 minutes of professional football. At the end of the 2013–14 campaign he was named as the club's Young Player of the Year, and also featured in Vale's Staffordshire Senior Cup final defeat to Rushall Olympic. However, in the summer Micky Adams confirmed that Hugill had rejected the club's offer of a new contract, and stated: "It is disappointing ... we spent a lot of time and effort with Jordan last season, but we will have to accept it."

Hugill signed a two-year contract with League One club Preston North End in June 2014, who paid Port Vale an undisclosed fee; manager Simon Grayson stated that "he's young, he's raring to go, hungry, he's a strong, powerful player, and he's got many attributes that will help us along the way this season and complement the squad well". He had an eventful match after coming on for Andrew Little as a 20th-minute substitute at Walsall on 13 September; he provided an assist for Joe Garner before being sent off for clashing with opposition defender Andy Butler, he also picked up an injury in the game that required surgery and a lengthy spell on the sidelines. He returned to fitness in February 2015, at which point he joined his former Vale manager Micky Adams at League Two side Tranmere Rovers for a one-month loan spell. On 26 March 2015, loan deadline day, Hugill signed for bottom-placed League Two club Hartlepool United on loan until the end of the season; "Pools" boss Ronnie Moore said that "It just didn't work at Tranmere. But we've seen a lot of him and he'll go straight in and get goals for us, no doubt about it". He scored four goals in eight games for the club, including the winning goal against Exeter City at Victoria Park that secured Pools' place in the English Football League. He was an unused substitute at Wembley in the play-off final as Preston won promotion into the Championship.

He signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract in October 2015. He ended the 2015–16 campaign with five goals in 32 games. He continued to impress in the 2016–17 season, and was given another new two-and-a-half-year contract in September 2016. The club rejected an offer of £1.5 million from Ipswich Town in January 2017. He ended the 2016–17 season with 13 goals in 47 appearances to end up as Preston's top-scorer. He started the 2017–18 season in good form and was linked with a number of clubs in the summer transfer window, and handed in a transfer request on 29 August.

On 31 January 2018, Hugill completed a deadline day signing for Premier League club West Ham United in a reported £10 million transfer deal, becoming manager David Moyes' second signing at the London Stadium. However he was restricted to a handful of brief cameos in the second half of the 2017–18 season, playing just 22 minutes in total.

On 8 August 2018, Hugill returned to the Championship on a season-long loan to Middlesbrough.

Hugill is a target man forward, has great strength and is able to out-muscle opposition defenders. Former Port Vale teammate Tom Pope stated that Hugill had an excellent attitude and "was desperate to learn and improve".

Sam Byram

Samuel Mark Byram (born 16 September 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays for Championship club Nottingham Forest, on loan from Premier League club West Ham United. He primarily plays as a right back, but can also play as a right midfielder or right winger.

Byram was called up to the England Under 20 team for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup but withdrew from the squad through injury and remains uncapped at international level.

Byram was born in Thurrock, Essex, before moving north, where he attended Ralph Butterfield Primary School, Haxby, and then Joseph Rowntree School in York. He played for the City Schools team as a boy before joining Leeds United. After completing his secondary education at school, he signed scholar forms with the West Yorkshire club in 2010. During his first year as scholar, he played 'down' a year in the under-16 team to help his development as a footballer.

He later progressed to his age group in the under-18s where he would become a regular in the team during his second year in 2011–12. As an integral part of the team, he scored several goals over the course of the season as the under-18s finished as runners-up to Newcastle United in their divisional academy league. Following the end of the season in May 2012, he was one of five young players rewarded with their first professional contracts for their performances in the campaign.

In the first friendly match of Leeds United's 2012–13 pre-season against Farsley Celtic, Byram was one of a number of youngsters given an opportunity to impress manager Neil Warnock when he lined up for the second half at Throstle Nest. United recorded a convincing 5–2 victory over their city rivals. Nevertheless, he would travel with the first-team on their summer tour of the South West of England the following week, featuring in the games against Tavistock, Bodmin Town and Torquay United. Byram remained as part of the first-team in pre-season after returning to the North; playing for an hour and scoring in the game away to Preston North End.

After impressing in pre-season, Byram was handed the number 25 shirt for the season ahead and he made his first team debut at Elland Road in a 4–0 victory over Shrewsbury Town on 11 August in the League Cup. Byram retained his place in the first-team the following week in United's first league game of the campaign against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was part of a defence that kept a clean-sheet in a 1–0 victory over one of the early favourites for promotion and his performance out-wide against the England international Matt Jarvis won praise from several observers. He signed a new three-year contract with the West Yorkshire club two days after his league debut and only three months after signing his first professional contract with the club.

Byram scored his first professional goal on 28 August in the 3–0 League Cup second-round victory over Oxford United. Picking up the ball just outside the penalty area, he beat two Oxford defenders with his first and second touches before chipping the goalkeeper from inside the box in the 34th minute to give his team a 2–0 lead. An impressed Neil Warnock told reporters after the game that "Sam will probably never score another goal like that in his career". Byram remained a permanent feature in the first-team squad during the early months of the season with United legend Eddie Gray tipping him to win a call-up to England Under-21 squad in the near future if he maintained his form. His former manager in the under-18s, Neil Redfearn, stated that Byram's rise through the ranks at the club served as a good example for other promising youngsters including his former teammates in the academy side, Ross Killock, Dominic Poleon and Simon Lenighan. On 2 October, he scored his first league goal for Leeds in a 2–2 draw away to Bolton Wanderers, heading in a cross from El Hadji Diouf. An away match at Leicester City on 5 March saw young Byram score his third goal for Leeds in a 1–1 draw.

After his impressive form for Leeds linked him with Premier League interest, Byram signed a new contract with Leeds on 26 January 2013, to extend his stay at the club until 2016. He scored his second league goal for the club on 6 March, in a 1–1 draw away at Leicester City, and followed this up with the equaliser in another 1–1 draw, at home to Peterborough United.

On 26 April 2013, Byram won the "Yorkshire Evening Post" Player of the Season award with 99% of the vote. After being linked with an £8 million pound move to Manchester City in the summer, Byram proclaimed that he wanted to stay at Leeds to try earn promotion.

At the club's annual end of season awards on 27 April, Byram won the Player of the Year Award, Young Player of the Year Award, Players Player of the Year Award and also the Supporters Club Player of the Year Award.

On 30 July 2013, Bryam was named in Sky Sports Football League Players to watch out for in the Football League.

The hip injury sustained at the end of the 2012–13 season ruled Byram out of the England under-20's World Cup. Bryam's injury caused him to miss the entire 2013–14 pre-season friendlies for Leeds. After missing the start of the 2013–14 season, on 6 August Leeds manager Brian McDermott announced that Byram had an injection in his hip and the injury may require surgery which could potentially rule him out for several months.

Byram made his first-team return on 21 September 2013, playing 57 minutes in Leeds' 2–1 defeat against Burnley. He also played Leeds' next game, a League Cup defeat to Newcastle United, playing the full 90 minutes. Byram played just 27 games during an injury hit season.

On 1 August, Byram was assigned the Leeds number 2 shirt for the 2014–15 season. On 9 August, Southampton manager Ronald Koeman confirmed that Leeds had rejected a bid of £4.5 million to sign Byram. Byram was given a straight red card on 23 August against Watford for an off the ball incident with Watford defender Daniel Pudil.

Byram scored his fourth goal for Leeds in a 2–1 win against Hudderfield Town on 31 January. In 2015, head coach Neil Redfearn changed Leeds' formation to a 4–2–3–1 with Byram moved forward into an attacking right wing position, with Scott Wootton played as the regular right back. Byram scored the second goal in a 2–0 away win over Reading on 10 February. On 18 March 2015, Byram scored for Leeds United against Fulham in a 3–0 away victory.

On 9 April, after rumoured Premier League interest in Byram and teammates Lewis Cook, Charlie Taylor and Alex Mowatt, head coach Neil Redfearn challenged Leeds United's owners to keep a hold of their homegrown talents.

On 2 May 2015, Byram was one of five players nominated for the Fans Player of the Year Award at Leeds United's official end of 2014–15 season awards ceremony, but lost out to eventual winner Alex Mowatt. Byram was also nominated for Young Player of the Year Award, but missed out on the Young Player of the Year award to Lewis Cook.

Byram started the pre-season for Leeds playing as a right forward in new manager Uwe Rösler's 4–3–3 formation. On 31 July 2015, Rösler revealed that despite speculation linking Byram to Premier League clubs, that he was not looking to sell the player and that he was an important player for the club. On 12 August 2015, Byram missed a penalty in a penalty shootout against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup, with Leeds losing 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

On 22 September 2015, Byram was criticized by Leeds owner Massimo Cellino who revealed he was "deeply offended" and "hurt" that Byram had not signed a new contract with the club. The "Yorkshire Evening Post" reported that the contract offer from Cellino to Byram was actually a reduction on his existing wage on a long term deal. On 5 December 2015, Bryam turned down a further contract offer, with the offer being just a one-year extension, however parity of his current wage.

On 17 December 2015, Byram scored a brace in the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers to seal Leeds' 3–2 win. On 27 December, Byram scored in the match against Nottingham Forest to end the match at 1–1.

On 5 January 2016, Byram was named Championship Player of the Month for December 2015 after scoring three goals and making assists throughout the month. After being subject to enquiries from Premier League clubs, on 7 January 2016 Leeds manager Steve Evans revealed that he wanted to keep Byram at the club but that club owner Massimo Cellino had advised the enquiries had not been concrete enough for a move to happen. Byram left Leeds in January 2016. He had played 143 games in all competitions for them, scoring 10 goals.

Byram signed for Premier League club West Ham United on a four-and-a-half year contract for an undisclosed fee on 20 January 2016. He made his West Ham debut as a 13th-minute substitute for the injured Carl Jenkinson on 23 January in a 2–2 draw against Manchester City. In his post-match interview, manager Slaven Bilić revealed that Byram had not been in the matchday squad but was a late inclusion following an injury to James Tomkins.

On 29 July 2016, Byram made his first start and appearance of the season in a 2–1 defeat against Slovenian Domžale in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round tie.

On 10 August 2018, Byram joined Nottingham Forest on loan for the remainder of the 2018–19 season. He made his debut for Forest on 14 August in the first round of the 2018–19 EFL Cup against Bury. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes with Forest going through to the second round 10–9 on penalties, one of which Byram scored for Forest.

On 17 May 2013, Byram was called up to the England under-20 team by Peter Taylor for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey. On 11 June, however, he withdrew as a precaution due to a hip injury sustained towards the end of the 2012–13 season.

Reece Joel Oxford (born 16 December 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for FC Augsburg on loan from West Ham United. Oxford made his debut for West Ham United F.C. aged 16 years and 198 days, making him the club's youngest ever player, beating a record of 16 years and 221 days set in 1922 by Billy Williams.

Oxford was born in Edmonton, London, and was a boyhood supporter of Arsenal. He began playing football at Tottenham Hotspur's academy but was released from the club in 2011. He then joined West Ham United at under-13 level. He turned out for the under-18 team while still an under-15 schoolboy, and made the bench for a League Cup match in August 2014, still aged 15.

On 11 January 2015, Oxford signed a long-term professional contract with West Ham. Four months later, he won the Dylan Tombides Academy Player of the Year Award.

Oxford made his competitive, first team debut on 2 July 2015, aged 16, starting in midfield in a 3–0 win against Andorran club Lusitanos in a UEFA Europa League first qualifying round first leg tie. In so doing, he became West Ham's youngest ever player. He then made his Premier League debut on 9 August, playing the first 79 minutes before being substituted for Kevin Nolan as West Ham won 2–0 away to Arsenal. Following his start, Oxford became the second-youngest Premier League starter of all-time, after Jose Baxter.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Oxford was named in "The Daily Telegraph"'s list of the best youth prospects in English football. On his 18th birthday, 16 December 2016, Oxford signed a new, four-and-a-half year contract with West Ham. Just over one month later, he was sent on loan to Reading for the remainder of the season. He made his Reading debut on 11 March 2017 in a 3–0 away defeat to Preston North End, coming on as a second-half substitute for Paul McShane. He made five appearances, his final match being the 8 April away defeat to Norwich City, 7–1.

On 21 June 2017, Oxford was sent on loan to German Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach for the 2017–18 season. He did not make his debut until 28 October when he came on as an 89th-minute substitute for Lars Stindl in a 1–3 win against Hoffenheim. On 12 December, Oxford made his first league start for Gladbach, against Freiburg. After the match, sporting director Max Eberl praised Oxford's development during his time at the club and stated exploratory talks had taken place over a permanent deal. His loan was cut short and he returned to West Ham on 29 December 2017.

On 31 January 2018 Oxford was loaned to Borussia Mönchengladbach again.

On 31 January 2019, Oxford again went out on loan, this time joining German team FC Augsburg until the end of the season.

Oxford has played for England up to under-20 level and captained his country at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The Young Lions reached the quarter-finals, and Oxford scored in the penalty shootout as they defeated Spain in a play-off for the 2015 U-17 World Cup. West Ham refused permission for him to play in the U17 World Cup in Chile, fearing that exposure to an international football tournament would lead to burnout.

UEFA.com has described his playing style as, "Tall and quick, he is not daunted in the face of illustrious opponents." On several occasions, Oxford has been compared to former West Ham academy graduate Rio Ferdinand.

Oxford is of Jamaican descent through his grandfather. His grandfather, Karl, is the brother of the Jamaican footballer Neville Oxford. In December 2018, Oxford was the victim of a theft when his 18-carat Rolex watch was stolen from the changing rooms at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground.

Browne was originally scheduled to fight Henry Buchanan, who pulled out after suffering an injury in training. The fight was also dropped from being televised. Browne, despite being heavily outweighed, won the fight via first round stoppage victory.

On April 11, 2015 Browne was matched with 36 year old Aaron Pryor Jr. (19-7-1, 12 KOs), son of hall of famer former Lineal light welterweight champion Aaron Pryor.

A month later, on May 29, Browne fought again at the Barclays Arena on the Amir Khan vs. Chris Algieri undercard. His opponent, considered as his best opponent to date was Cornelius White (21-3, 16 KOs). White had lost his last two fights via stoppage, against Sergey Kovalev and Thomas Wiliams Jr., the latter who he fought in January 2014. In the fifth round, both fighters tumbled to the canvas. Browne used his fast hands and outworked White in most rounds, who moved well enough to survive the full ten rounds, but he was in survival mode the last three rounds. Browne went ten rounds for the first time, winning a clear unanimous decision (99-91, 99-91, 98-92).

Four months later in September, Browne fought Spanish boxer and former WBA light heavyweight champion Gabriel Campillo (25-7-1, 12 KOs) at the Foxwoods Resort in Ledyard, Connecticut. Campillo was dropped twice in the first round, the second time, the count was waived giving Browne his 8th first round stoppage win. Browne returned again three months later in December against Mexican boxer and former IBO super middleweight title challenger Francisco Sierra (26-9-1, 23 KOs).

In the replay, it shows that Browne landed a punch whilst Kalajdzic slipped. Browne was also dropped in the sixth round. Both fighters claimed they had won in the post fight press conference. A rematch, according to promoter Lou DiBella, was discussed. With the win, Browne won the vacant title.

The next day, Kalajdzic hit out at Browne, calling for a rematch, "I don't see how I lost. I was the aggressor. I showed my heart. If he feels like he beat me, give me the rematch." Browne later stated that he would not be giving Kalajdzic a rematch.

On fight night, Browne did not let Ntetu get into the fight, stopping him at 2 minutes and 15 seconds into the first round. Browne knocked Ntetu down with a right hand and left hook, which put him down flat on the canvas. Ntetu beat the count but ended up taking some hard shots to the head from Browne until referee Arthur Mercente stepped in and halted the fight.

On March 13, 2018 The Ring reported that rising contender Browne would likely challenge for his first world title against either Sergey Kovalev (32-2-1, 28 KOs) for the WBO title or IBF beltholder Artur Beterbiev (12-0, 12 KOs), where he was in a mandatory position. On March 18, a deal had been agreed for Kovalev to defend his WBO light heavyweight title against Browne at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City on HBO. A date as early as June 23 was discussed but not finalized.

Castillo was entering the fight with a 3-fight win streak, which saw all the wins come via stoppage. Despite a knockdown, Browne dominated Castillo over 10 rounds to win a unanimous decision. Browne started the fight at a steady pace. In round 5, as Browne was coming forward, he managed to land a few shots, at the same time, Castillo also landed a solid combination which saw Browne hit the canvas. Browne rose to his feet and did not look hurt. Castillo failed to carry on the momentum and Browne regained control of the fight using distance. The scores were 98-91, 98-91 and 97-92.

In November 2018, Browne called out Badou Jack (22-1-3, 13 KOs) to fight him in what was an 'open division' as both traded words on Instagram. Both boxers claimed they were available to take the fight next and a few days later, Jack stated he was open to fighting WBA champion Dmitry Bivol, after Bivol's successful defence against veteran boxer Jean Pascal. According to RingTV.com on November 26, a deal was close to being reached for Jack and Browne to fight on the Manny Pacquiao vs. Adrien Broner Showtime PPV undercard on January 19, 2019. On December 17, the fight was announced to take place on the PPV undercard, taking place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. Although both were ranked highly with the WBC, the fight would be contested for the WBA Interim light heavyweight title. Browne was 'honored and a privileged' to be able to fight on a big PPV undercard. He was also excited with the opportunity of fighting his first big name on his way to becoming a household name.

Julian Dicks

Julian Andrew Dicks (born 8 August 1968) is an English former professional footballer, manager and former professional golfer. He is currently the manager of Isthmian League North Division club Heybridge Swifts.

Playing from 1985 until 2002, he was a defender, notably in the Premier League for West Ham United and Liverpool. He was voted West Ham's player of the year four times between 1990 and 1997. He also played in the Football League for Birmingham City where he started his footballing career, ending it in 2002 in non-league football with Canvey Island. He became manager of Wivenhoe Town in 2009, before moving to Grays Athletic later that year. He was capped by both the England U21 and England B sides. He was known as a "hard man" adopting the nickname of The Terminator. He was a tough tackler with a strong shot in regular demand as a penalty and free-kick taker. Dicks had a reputation for poor on-field discipline which brought him to the attention of referees, the press and footballing authorities.

Dicks was born in Keynsham Hospital, Bristol to mother, Carol and father Ron who worked as a fork-lift truck driver for Courage Brewery. Ron played non-league football with Keynsham Town, Welton Rovers, Frome Town and Shepton Mallet whom he would also go on to manage. Dicks attended Novers Lane Primary School, in Knowle, Bristol and Merrywood Boys Secondary School also in Knowle. At age 11 he was watched by former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Bill Nicholson who was scouting for West Ham United, but was turned down as he "was not quick enough". At age 13 he was spotted playing by Ron Veal who was scouting for Aston Villa. Veal recommended him to Villa manager, Ron Saunders, however Saunders lost his job at Villa on 9 February 1982. When he was appointed as manager of Birmingham City nine days later, Veal also changed his employer. Saunders was impressed when he watched Dicks play and he was offered a footballing apprenticeship with Birmingham City in 1982 when Dicks turned 14.

He started his footballing career at Birmingham City, aged 14, having moved from his home in Bristol. Playing as an apprentice he worked his way through the youth and reserve set-ups before making his debut in 1985 in a 2–0 away defeat to Chelsea. In 1988, he was signed by manager John Lyall for West Ham United, for £300,000, giving him the chance of First Division football that Birmingham's relegation in 1986 had denied him. Although Dicks had been booked 33 times and sent-off once in all competitions, in his four seasons with Birmingham City, Lyall identified potential in the player enthusing "There was a great touch there. I wouldn't have signed just a physical player".

Dicks made his debut for West Ham on 2 April 1988 in a Division One game against Sheffield Wednesday. West Ham lost the game 2-1. He would go on to make eight appearances in the 1987-88 season, his first season with West Ham. The following season, he became a regular player and first choice left back for The Hammers, starting the first game of the season, a 4-0 away defeat to Southampton and playing 34 of a possible 38 games that season. The season also saw his first goal for the club in a 2-1 defeat at Highbury to Arsenal. It was a poor season for West Ham who were relegated to Division Two having finished one place off the bottom of the league in 19th place with 38 points. Relegation had seen the sacking of manager John Lyall and the appointment of Scot, Lou Macari. The new manager and Dicks exhibited a poor working relationship from the outset. Despite this, and with West Ham now playing second tier football, Dicks retained his left back position and became their regular penalty taker following the exit of former first choice taker, Ray Stewart. Dicks became well known for his penalties. During his West Ham career he scored 35, missing four. His first penalty success came on 23 September 1989 proving to be the only goal in a win against Watford. A future regular captain of the West Ham side, this season also saw his first captaincy, in a League Cup game on 19 September 1989 against his former club, Birmingham City, with manager Macari telling him "I'm making you captain today and I'm making you penalty taker too". Dicks was often cautioned and sent off by referees. His first red-card was in a match versus Wimbledon in the Football League Cup in the 1989–90 season. It was an infamous encounter which included an on-pitch brawl between the opposing players. The fighting was sparked by a two-footed tackle by Wimbledon player, Dennis Wise on Dicks. Six players were booked with the game being described as "a disgrace to football" by journalist, Brian Woolnough. West Ham finished 7th in a season which saw the departure of Lou Macari and the appointment of former player, Billy Bonds as manager. Dicks and Bonds both had reputations as "hard men" and quarrelled frequently.

The 1990-91 season saw the start of Dicks' injury problems. On 13 October 1990, playing in a game against Bristol City at Ashton Gate, Dicks hit a dip on the edge of the pitch, his foot going over the edge resulting in a loss of feeling in his left leg. He continued to play but after the game he could barely walk. Against the medical assessment of John Green, who was soon to take over as club physiotherapist, he was told to "crash-on" and in the words of manager Bonds "if the knee goes, it goes". Green believe Dicks was in need of an operation on his knee cartilage. He was picked to play in the next game, against Swindon Town but lasted only 38 minutes. He played again in the next game on 24 October 1990, against Blackburn Rovers but again had to be substituted. A knee operation followed and he would not play again until 21 December 1991 by which time West Ham had been promoted back to the First Division.

He played in the second half of the 1991–92 season. Despite his presence, the team finished bottom of the First Division and missed out on the first season of the Premier League. The 1992–93 season was an eventful one for Dicks, mainly for the wrong reasons. He was sent off three times and picked up a string of bookings which saw him miss significant periods of the season and he was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Bonds. His first dismissal came after he threw his elbow into the face of Newcastle United player Franz Carr. There had been no friction between the two players with Dicks saying of the incident "Not to this day do I know why I did it. I had it in my mind that I was going to elbow him, and that was it — bang!". Only four games passed before he was dismissed again. In a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Dicks clashed with Paul Birch and Steve Bull before being sent-off, with Billy Bonds having to stop him attacking Birch who was still on the ground. Barely three months passed before his third dismissal of the season. In January 1993 after two bad fouls on Derby County midfielder Ted McMinn he was sent-off, having to be escorted from the pitch by teammate Clive Allen. Despite his disciplinary problems he earned a Division One runners-up medal as West Ham reached the Premier League. Despite his dismissals he played 34 league games of a possible 46 in the promotion season, scoring eleven goals, placing third in the list of highest goal scorers for that season behind only Clive Allen and Trevor Morley.

Now playing in the Premier League for the first time, West Ham struggled in their first seven games. New signing Simon Webster had a long term injury having had his leg broken by Dicks in a training session accident. Fellow new signee Dale Gordon had failed to make the impression on the side his transfer had intended. In a move engineered by West Ham's then-Assistant Manager Harry Redknapp, Dicks was transferred in order to bring in new players. Liverpool manager Graeme Souness, on the recommendation of Redknapp, watched Dicks play in a West Ham match against Swindon Town on 11 September 1993. Souness thought Dicks to be "my kind of player" and signed him for Liverpool that week in a swap deal which involved David Burrows and Mike Marsh moving to West Ham. Extra money received by West Ham from the transfer was used by Redknapp to buy veteran striker, Lee Chapman. Dicks' signing had been part of an effort by Souness to "toughen up" the Liverpool team as he had planned to pair him with fellow hard man, Neil Ruddock.

Dicks debut on 18 September came in a high-profile game against local rivals, Everton at Goodison Park. In an eventful game, Liverpool lost 2-0. Former West Ham players, Mark Ward and Tony Cottee scored with Dicks' mistake on the ball allowing Cottee to control it and score. The game was also memorable for the on-pitch fighting of Liverpool teammates Steve McManaman and Bruce Grobelaar. By now a regular in the Liverpool side Dicks scored his opening goal, a shot from 25 yards, in a 3-0 away win against Oldham Athletic in January 1994. His discipline had also improved and he had yet to be booked whilst in Liverpool colours. Unfortunately for Dicks, Souness was proving to be an unpopular manager. He had dropped fan's favourites Ian Rush and John Barnes to the reserve team due to perceived under performance and he had tried to integrate too many young and inexperienced players. In February 1994 after a shock FA Cup loss to Bristol City, a game in which Dicks did not play, the fans were calling for him to resign. Souness left Liverpool after three years in charge, in February 1994. He was replaced by Roy Evans who had always disliked Dicks and his style of play. Working under Souness he had kept his opinions to himself. Now with Evans as Liverpool manager Dicks' found himself out of favour. Dicks and Evans and his assistants Ronnie Moran and Steve Heighway, disagreed over training methods, Dicks' fitness (they considered him to be overweight) and diet. Evans banished him to play with the reserve and to train with 15- and 16-year-olds. He played for Liverpool on 7 May 1994 in a 2-1 away defeat to Aston Villa. It proved to be his last first-team game for the club.

The pre-season of the 1994-95 season started badly for Liverpool and for Dicks. Picked to play in a friendly game against Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park on 26 July 1994, Liverpool lost 4-1. Evans was again critical of Dicks' performance in the defeat; tired of such criticism he asked for a move from the club. He had played 28 games for Liverpool in all competitions, scoring three goals, although Dicks has the honour of being the last Liverpool player to score in front of the standing Spion Kop at Anfield in a 1–0 win against Ipswich Town near the end of the 1993–94 season. His Liverpool career lasted only 13 months, a short time considering his former manager Souness had said of Dicks, "if I was to pick the best 11 players I've ever worked with, he'd be one of them".

On re-signing Dicks, manager Harry Redknapp commented that he believed that his chairman thought he "was off his rocker" because Dicks was considerably heavier than when he had departed for Liverpool a year earlier. His first game in his second spell for the Hammers, on 22 October 1994, saw a 2-0 home win against Southampton and, in keeping with his reputation, Dicks was booked. Dicks played a major part in helping to keep West Ham in the Premier League in 1994–95 scoring five goals. The 1995–96 saw him equal highest goalscorer, with Tony Cottee, for West Ham in the Premier with ten league goals. This season also included a game as goalkeeper in a game against Everton on 19 December 1995. Dicks took over the goalkeeper's gloves after regular 'keeper, Ludek Miklosko had been sent-off for a foul on Daniel Amokachi. He let in two goals as Everton won 3-0. He was named Man of the Match. In 1996–97 he scored twice in a crucial London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on 24 February 1997 at The Boleyn Ground that West Ham won 4–3. Before the game West Ham had not won in nine games. The game signified the start of a fight back against relegation from the Premier League. West Ham had been in 18th place before the game but would go on the finish 14th at the end of the season.

Another knee injury resulted in him missing the entire 1997–98 season. He did return to action in the 1998–99 season and West Ham finished fifth to qualify for the UEFA Cup, but his injury problems failed to go away and he was restricted to just nine Premier League games. West Ham then terminated his contract and he retired from professional football after a 14-year career, 11 years of which had been spent at West Ham. In two spells at West Ham, he had played 315 competitive games and scored 64 goals, many of them penalties. His final appearance for the club came against Arsenal on 6 February 1999, with his final goal coming in the FA Cup against Swansea City on 2 January 1999.

In 2000 Dicks was granted a testimonial match by West Ham. On 13 August 2000 a West Ham eleven took on Spanish side Athletic Bilbao at the Boleyn Ground. The game was marred by a 17 player brawl in which West Ham player Igor Stimac was booked for a bad tackle and the West Ham captain for the day, Paolo Di Canio, slapped several Spanish players in the face. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp was ordered to remove Di Canio for the pitch to defuse the tension. Bilbao coach, Txetxu Rojo, was ordered to remove player Joseba Etxeberria for a similar reason. Bilbao won the game 2-1 Dicks received £200,000 from the game.

In 2001, he made a brief return to football after signing for non-League Canvey Island. Only ten days after signing for Canvey Island, he was involved in an FA Cup shock. Playing against Football League side Wigan Athletic in the first round of the competition, Canvey turned-out 1-0 winners. The success continued in the next round. Again facing Football League opposition in Northampton Town, Canvey won 1-0 with a goal from Neil Gregory with a goal instigated with a move by Dicks.

Dicks made his debut for the England under-21 team in Lausanne, Switzerland in a friendly game against the Switzerland under-21 team on 28 May 1988. The game finished 1-1 with the England goal being scored by Paul Gascoigne. Dicks' performance convinced manager Dave Sexton to call him into the squad for the 1988 Toulon Tournament. He played in England's first game of the competition against the Mexico under-21 team in the Stade Mayol in Toulon on 5 June 1988. He was sent-off for a foul on a Mexican player. Undeterred by his sending-off, after missing one game through suspension, Sexton picked Dicks to play in the semi-final against the Morocco under-21 team and for the final against the France under-21 team which England lost 4-2.
Four years later, in 1992, Dicks was called in to the England B team. He played only two games for the side; a 1-0 win in the Stadion Střelecký ostrov stadium, Budweis, Czechoslovakia against the Czechoslovakia team and a 1-1 draw in the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow against the CIS team.

In 1995 England first team manager, Terry Venables, was putting together a squad to compete in Euro96 in England. Dicks' performances had earlier given rise to journalists to call for his inclusion in the squad. Two further disciplinary events ended such calls. On 11 September 1995 he was booked for stamping on the head of Chelsea's John Spencer in a 3-1 home defeat for West Ham. Spencer required eight stitches in his head. On 16 September 1995 at Highbury he was dismissed for the eighth time in his career for a foul on Arsenal's Ian Wright. The two incidents coming so close together caused the media to focus on the incident involving John Spencer. TV pundit Andy Gray and politician, radio journalist and Chelsea supporter, David Mellor called for FA to get involved. The game had been televised live on Sky TV and a recording of it was provided to the match referee, Robbie Hart who had booked Dicks during the game. The Sun newspaper ran a full back-page on the incident with several pictures of the challenge and of blood on Spencer's face. Mellor's radio program, 606, had focused so intently on the clash that combined with The Sun's coverage, public focus was sufficient for Dicks' daughters to be attacked at their school in Essex. The FA considered the video evidence provided and a report from referee Hart and Dicks was given a three-match ban. This ban put in doubt any future involvement in England squads due to concerns over his indiscipline and although Venables watched him play in April 1996 he was not called into the Euro 96 squad.

In 1997 with Glenn Hoddle now manager of England, Dicks met, by chance, his assistant, John Gorman whilst on holiday. Dicks claims Gorman had told him he would stand a better chance of being picked if he had grown his hair. Dicks frequently shaved his head sporting a skinhead hairstyle. Gorman also said that Dicks had been a candidate for selection for a game against Mexico in 1997. By this time Dicks had said he no longer wished to be considered for international selection.

Dicks returned to football on 5 January 2009 when he was appointed manager of Eastern Counties League side Wivenhoe Town, but left the club shortly after the end of that season by mutual consent.

Conference National club Grays Athletic announced Dicks as their new manager on 15 September 2009. In his first season at Grays, he was relegated from the Conference, whilst the club voluntarily dropped three levels to the Isthmian League Division One North. After finishing 10th in the following season, Dicks left Grays by mutual consent in May 2011.

Dicks took take charge of the Sealand side at the Tynwald Hill International Football Tournament on the Isle of Man in July 2013.

On 19 June 2014, Dicks was appointed as a new manager of the West Ham United Ladies. His first competitive game was against Spurs Ladies. He helped to improve the team from their 10th-place finish that season and then to a sixth-placed finish in the 2014-15 season, along with a London FA Capital Women's Cup Final date against Charlton Athletic Ladies which West Ham ladies lost 5-0.

On 29 June 2015, Dicks was appointed first-team coach for his former team, West Ham United, under new manager and former teammate, Slaven Bilic.
In June 2016, Dicks signed a contract to keep him on the coaching staff at West Ham for a further two years. When Bilic was sacked by West Ham in November 2017, Dicks also left the club.

On 4 October 2018, Dicks was appointed manager of Heybridge Swifts. His first two games as manager, against Mildenhall Town and Bury Town, resulted in wins for The Swifts.

Dicks met his wife Kay in 1985 and they married in 1988. They had twin daughters Jessica and Katie in December 1988. The couple were married for 13 years until divorcing in 2001. His brother, Grantley is also a former footballer and coach. After retiring as a footballer, Dicks took up golf and soon turned professional, but was forced to give this career up due to his knee injury and the realization that he did not have the ability to win tournaments. He went on to run the Shepherd and Dog Public House in Langham, near Colchester, Essex.

In 2014, he made a cameo appearance in the spoof football violence film "The Hooligan Factory".

Billy Bonds

William Arthur Bonds MBE (born 17 September 1946) is a former professional footballer and manager, who is most often associated with West Ham United with whom he spent 27 years as player and manager. He played 799 first-team games for West Ham in a career spanning 21 seasons.

Born in Woolwich, south-east London, Bonds grew up in nearby Eltham, where he played for a Sunday boys' team, Moatbridge, and Kent Schoolboys and joined the groundstaff at Charlton Athletic after leaving school at 15. He played in the youth and A team and occasionally in the reserves before joining the playing staff shortly before his 18th birthday in September 1964.

Bonds made his League debut for Charlton against Northampton Town in February 1965 and became a regular in the first team, going on to make 95 League appearances, scoring one goal, before being signed by Ron Greenwood for West Ham United for a fee of £50,000 in May 1967. He made his first appearance for West Ham in a testimonial match for Ken Brown in the same month and made his League debut against Sheffield Wednesday in the opening game of the 1967–68 season. He was ever-present in the 1968–69 and 1969–70 seasons and played 124 consecutive league games until injury ended his run of appearances in October 1970.
Bonds played his first three seasons as a right-back before Greenwood switched him to midfield in the 1970–71 season where he counterbalanced the skills of Trevor Brooking. Bonds was at his peak in the early 1970s, helping West Ham to the semi-final of the Football League Cup in the 1971–72 season, where they lost to Stoke City after a second replay, and topping the scorers list at West Ham in the 1973–74 season with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against Chelsea. After the departure of Bobby Moore in March 1974, Bonds was appointed to the captaincy and led the club to an FA Cup final victory over Fulham in 1975 and to the final of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup despite a groin injury that interrupted the latter half of the 1974–75 season and part of the 1975–76 season. Greenwood moved Bonds from midfield to the back four as centre-half alongside Tommy Taylor shortly before the end of the 1976–77 season, where he was able to come out from defence with the ball.

He experienced relegation with West Ham at the end of the 1977–78 season but led West Ham to a second FA Cup victory over First Division club Arsenal in 1980, becoming the only West Ham captain to lift the FA Cup on two occasions. In 1980–81, he led West Ham to the final of the League Cup, which was lost to Liverpool after a replay, and to promotion back to the First Division.

Bonds passed Bobby Moore's club record of appearances in 1982–83 and 'officially' retired in May 1984, relinquishing the captaincy to Alvin Martin. A spate of injuries to first-team players saw him return to the squad and make 26 league and cup appearances in 1984–85. He missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a toe injury but, having passed his 40th birthday, he was able to re-establish himself in the first-team during the 1986–87 season. A knee injury that forced him out of the last two games of the 1987–88 season led to a decision to finally retire in the summer of 1988, having played his last game at Southampton in April 1988 at the age of 41 years and 226 days.

Bonds had remained at the club as a player for over 20 years, scoring 48 goals in a club record 663 League appearances. He established himself as a local hero and was the supporters' choice for 'Hammer of the Year' in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1987. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in January 1988 and was presented with the PFA Merit Award in April 1988 by his fellow professional players. In May 2013 Bonds was awarded West Ham United's first ever lifetime achievement award.

On 6 February 2019 it was announced that the East Stand at The London Stadium will be renamed the Billy Bonds Stand. The unveiling took place ahead of West Ham's home fixture against Newcastle United on 2 March.

Bonds was capped twice at England Under-23 international level and was on the bench as a non-playing substitute for the senior international team for a World Cup qualifying match against Italy in November 1977. A collision with goalkeeper Phil Parkes in the last game of the 1980-1981 season broke two of Bonds' ribs, and ruled him out of selection for England against Brazil in May 1981. Bonds and Alvin Martin were in line to make their England debuts in that game.

After Bonds retired as a player in 1988, West Ham manager John Lyall appointed him as youth coach. He unsuccessfully applied for the manager's post when Lyall left the club in July 1989 after West Ham had been relegated. However, when new manager Lou Macari resigned seven months later, Bonds was appointed manager in February 1990. In his first full season in charge, he took the club to promotion, when they finished as runner-up to Oldham Athletic in 1990-91 season, also reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup where they lost to Nottingham Forest. He was awarded a second testimonial in the same season.

West Ham were relegated in the 1991–92 season in bottom place, but the board kept faith in Bonds and he led them to promotion the following season, when they finished as runner-up to Newcastle United. Bonds guided West Ham to a 13th-place finish in the 1993–94 Premier League. He resigned in August 1994, just before the new season began, when he was replaced by Harry Redknapp. He had spells in coaching at Queens Park Rangers and Reading before making a return to management with Millwall in May 1997. He managed 53 games before being sacked by the club the following year as they finished in the bottom half of Division Two.

Alvin Martin

Alvin Edward Martin (born 29 July 1958) is an English retired footballer who played as a defender.

Playing most of his footballing career for West Ham United he appeared in 598 games for them, scoring 34 goals. With the club for 21 years, and winning the 1980 FA Cup Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with Leyton Orient before moving into football management with Southend United. This lasted two seasons before he started a career in the media on radio station talkSPORT and also as a pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.
Playing 17 times for England during the 1980s, Martin represented them at the 1986 World Cup.

Born in Walton, Liverpool, Lancashire, Martin played schools football for Bootle and Lancashire and was attached to Merseyside club Everton as a schoolboy, but left in 1974 after the Goodison Park club only offered him an apprenticeship on a part-time basis. An unsuccessful trial later that summer with Queens Park Rangers was followed the very next day by one for West Ham United, where he was awarded a contract as an apprentice 19 August 1974. He appeared in the FA Youth cup final of 1975 and signed as a professional on 29 July 1976. He did not make his first team debut until 18 March 1978 as a substitute against Aston Villa. His final appearance was as an 88th-minute substitute on 5 May 1996 against Sheffield Wednesday.

Martin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at Upton Park, in which he became one of only two players, along with Billy Bonds, to be awarded two testimonials. The first was against Spurs on 21 August 1988 and the second against Chelsea on 11 November 1995. It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Martin — nicknamed 'Stretch' — enjoyed his most rewarding years, winning the FA Cup and Second Division winners medals in successive seasons, 1980 and 1981.

Martin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a hat-trick against three different Newcastle United goalkeepers — Martin Thomas, who was then injured, and outfield players Chris Hedworth and Peter Beardsley — in a Football League First Division match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8–1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as it finished third in the top level, just four points behind champions Liverpool, with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals.

Martin remained loyal to West Ham despite their relegation from the top flight in 1989, and helped them gain promotion two years later. The club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the Premier League before finally departing at the end of the 1995–96 season after 21 years service, aged 37.
After leaving West Ham, Martin had a brief spell with East London neighbours Leyton Orient, before managing Southend United for two years, during which the club was relegated to the League One.

Martin was given his first England cap by Ron Greenwood against Brazil at Wembley in May 1981. Injury ruled him out of the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain, but he was playing some of the finest football of his career when the next manager, Bobby Robson, included him in his squad for the 1986 edition in Mexico: he played in the victory over Paraguay, replacing the suspended Terry Fenwick, but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by Argentina's infamous 'Hand of God'; in total, he made 17 international appearances.

After retiring from management, he joined national radio station talkSPORT, while also being a regular pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.

Martin's sons, David and Joe, are also footballers. The former is a goalkeeper, whilst the latter is a defender.

Bobby Moore

Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 – 24 February 1993) was an English professional footballer. He most notably played for West Ham United, captaining the club for more than ten years, and was the captain of the England national team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, and was cited by Pelé as the greatest defender that he had ever played against.

Widely regarded as West Ham's greatest ever player, Moore played over 600 games for the club during a 16 year tenure, winning the FA Cup in 1963–64 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1964–65. During his time at the club he won the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1964 and the West Ham Player Of The Year in 1961, 1963, 1968 and 1970. In August 2008, West Ham United officially retired his number 6 shirt, 15 years after his death.

Moore was made captain of England in 1964, at age 23, going on to lift the World Cup trophy in 1966. He won a total of 108 caps for his country, which at the time of his international retirement in 1973 was a national record. This record was later broken by Peter Shilton. Moore's total of 108 caps continued as a record for an outfield player until 28 March 2009, when David Beckham gained his 109th cap. Moore is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore is positioned at the entrance to Wembley Stadium.

A composed central defender, Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an OBE in the New Year Honours List. He was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.

Moore was born in Barking, Essex. He attended Westbury Primary School Barking, and Tom Hood School, Leytonstone, playing football for both schools.

In 1956, Moore joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, he played his first game on 8 September 1958 against Manchester United. In putting on the number six shirt, he replaced his mentor Malcolm Allison, who was suffering from tuberculosis.

Allison never played another first team game for West Ham nor indeed any other First Division game as Moore became a regular. A composed central defender, Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Indeed, Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class.

Moore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full time. As red cards were not issued at that time, the dismissal didn't become apparent until after the match.

Moore also played cricket for the Essex youth team alongside fellow West Ham player Geoff Hurst.

In 1960, Moore earned a call up to the England Under-23 squad. His form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned him a late call-up to the full England squad by Walter Winterbottom and The Football Association selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's World Cup finals in Chile. Moore was uncapped as he flew to South America with the rest of the squad, but made his début on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly – a 4–0 win over Peru in Lima. Also débuting that day was Tottenham Hotspur defender Maurice Norman. Both proved so impressive that they stayed in the team for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners Brazil in the quarter finals at Viña del Mar.
On 29 May 1963, 22-year-old Moore captained his country for the first time in just his 12th appearance after the retirement of Johnny Haynes and an injury to his successor, Jimmy Armfield. He was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated Czechoslovakia 4–2 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach Alf Ramsey gave Moore the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the European Championships.

1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Moore. As well as gaining the England captaincy, he lifted the FA Cup as West Ham defeated Preston North End 3–2 in the final at Wembley, courtesy of a last-minute goal from Ronnie Boyce. On a personal level, Moore also was successfully treated for testicular cancer and was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year.

The FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the European Cup Winners Cup after West Ham defeated 1860 Munich 2–0 in the final with both goals coming from Alan Sealey. By now he was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.

1966 had a mixed start for Moore. In January, he scored his first England goal in a 1–1 draw with Poland at Goodison Park, but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the League Cup – in its last season before its transfer to Wembley as a one-off final – which they lost 5–3 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and his West Ham teammates Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, considerable consolation lay ahead. Moore scored his second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against Norway, two weeks before the World Cup would begin.

On the verge of his greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore had let his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of Sir Alf Ramsey and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham to allow him to captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up.

Moore was the leader of the World Cup winning side and established himself as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, they then beat Argentina in their quarter final and a Eusébio-led Portugal team in the semi-finals. West Germany awaited in the final.

According to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter – who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps – was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.

In the final, England went 1–0 down through Helmut Haller, but Moore's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. He was fouled by Wolfgang Overath midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, he picked himself up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Hurst scored.

The West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2–1 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through Wolfgang Weber – as Moore appealed unsuccessfully for a handball decision – to take the match into extra time.

Ramsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore on the edge of his own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst 40 yards (40 m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.

Of many memorable images from that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as she presented him with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup). "The Guardian" wrote "Moore is the calmest person in the stadium as he leads the England players up to the Royal Box".

Moore became a national icon as a consequence of England's success, with him and the other two West Ham players taking the World Cup around the grounds which West Ham visited during the following domestic season. He was awarded the coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years. He was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.

Moore's image and popularity allowed him to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, Upton Park, and he also appeared with his wife Tina, along with Peters and his wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to "Look in at the local".

He continued to play for West Ham and England, earning his 50th cap in a 5–1 win over Wales at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the 1968 European Championships. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where they played Yugoslavia in Florence and lost 1–0. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and Moore remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning his 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to South America for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in Mexico.

The year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Moore. Retained as captain for the 1970 World Cup, there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in Bogotá, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for it. While Moore had been in the shop (having entered with Bobby Charlton to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against Ecuador in Quito. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2–0 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of house arrest. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Moore received a guard of honour from his squad when he arrived at the team hotel.
Moore went on to play a leading role in England's progress through their group. On 2 June he captained England to a 1–0 victory against Romania. In the second game against favourites Brazil, there was a defining moment for Moore when he tackled Jairzinho with such precision and cleanness that it has been described as the perfect tackle. It continues to be shown on television around the world. Brazil still won the game 1–0, but England progressed through the group. Moore swapped shirts with Pelé after the game. The shirt was displayed at the National Football Museum in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection. A 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in the group and advance to the knockout stage.

At the Quarter Final stage, a rematch of the 1966 World Cup against West Germany, England took a 2–0 lead but lost 3–2 in extra time. At the end of the year, Moore was voted runner-up (behind Gerd Müller of West Germany) for the 1970 European Footballer of the Year award.

On 10 August 1970, Moore received an anonymous threat to kidnap his wife and hold her to a £10,000 ransom. This caused him to pull out of pre-season friendlies against Bristol City and Bournemouth. However, his services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against Celtic at the end of 1970.

Although Moore was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, he was not without his faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool. The nightclub in Blackpool was owned by Moore's friend, boxer Brian London. West Ham lost the tie 4–0. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of Division one at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on "This Is Your Life" the night before. Brian Glanville stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the alcohol he had consumed the night before.

Moore surpassed West Ham's appearances record in 1973 when he played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on Valentine's Day 1973, he won his 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. By this stage, only Peters and Alan Ball from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the England team. Later the same year, Moore was exposed defensively by Poland in a qualifier for the 1974 World Cup in Chorzów, deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper Peter Shilton to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to Wlodzimierz Lubanski, who scored the second.

Moore's form had dipped enough for Ramsey to choose not to select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by Norman Hunter in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: "Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year." It never happened, as England could only draw 1–1. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorzów, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to David Miller "you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch." Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken. England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.

Moore won his 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1–0 friendly defeat to Italy on 14 November 1973. He became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton's record by two appearances, and equalled Billy Wright's record of 90 appearances as captain. Peter Shilton, David Beckham and Steven Gerrard have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.

Moore played his last game for West Ham in an FA Cup tie against Hereford United in January 1974. He was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, he was allowed to leave West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with him the club record for appearances (since overtaken by Billy Bonds) and the most international caps for an outfield player.

He joined London rivals Fulham, who were in the Second Division, for £25,000. During Moore's first season there they defeated West Ham in a League Cup tie and then reached the FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2–0, and Moore had made his final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.

Moore played his final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against Blackburn Rovers. He played for two teams in the North American Soccer League – San Antonio Thunder in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and Seattle Sounders in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by Gerry Francis. This was the U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament, which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the European Championships that year. In April 1978 he signed his very last contract as a professional player, when he joined Danish side Herning Fremad to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.

In 1983, Moore appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct Carolina Lightnin', after injuries left the club without cover.

Moore retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at Eastern AA in Hong Kong, Oxford City and Southend United. Moore publicly supported Margaret Thatcher in the 1979 General Election.

He became manager of Southend United in 1984. In his first full season, 1984–85, Southend narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election to the Football League amid severe financial difficulties. However, the side was gradually rebuilt and in the 1985–86 season Southend started well and were in the promotion race until the new year before eventually finishing 9th. His successor, David Webb built upon those foundations to win promotion the following year. Moore agreed to serve on the board of the club and held this role until his death. Moore joined London radio station Capital Gold as a football analyst and commentator in 1990.

His life after football was eventful and difficult, with poor business dealings and his marriage ending. Moore's supporters said that the Football Association could have given a role to Moore, as the only Englishman to captain a FIFA World Cup winning team or given him an ambassadorial role.

Moore's first brush with cancer was in 1964, two years before the historic World Cup win. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which he survived by having one testicle surgically removed; the cancer had not spread. In April 1991, Moore underwent an emergency operation for suspected colon cancer, though at the time it was just reported that he had undergone an "emergency stomach operation".

On 14 February 1993, he publicly announced he was suffering from bowel and liver cancer; by this stage the cancer had spread. Three days later, he commentated on an England match against San Marino at Wembley, alongside his friend Jonathan Pearce. That was to be his final public appearance; seven days later on 24 February, at 6.36 am, he died at the age of 51.
He was the first member of the England World Cup winning side to die, the second being Alan Ball 14 years later. Moore was also outlived by the trainer of the side, Harold Shepherdson, who died in September 1995, and the manager of the side, Alf Ramsey, who died in April 1999. Ray Wilson died in May 2018, as did Gordon Banks in February 2019. Bobby Moore's funeral was held on 2 March 1993 at Putney Vale crematorium and his ashes were buried in a plot at City of London Cemetery and Crematorium with his father, Robert Edward Moore (who died in 1978) and his mother, Doris Joyce Moore, who had died only the previous year.

The first West Ham home game after his death was on 6 March 1993, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Boleyn Ground was awash with floral tributes, scarves and other football memorabilia from both West Ham fans and those of other clubs. Fellow 1966 World Cup winners Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters placed a floral replica of a West Ham shirt, showing Moore's number, 6, on the back, on the centre spot before the game. West Ham rested the No. 6 for the game, with the regular No. 6, Ian Bishop, wearing No. 12. The game was won by West Ham 3–1 with goals by Trevor Morley, Julian Dicks and Matty Holmes for West Ham and Steve Bull for Wolves.
His former England teammate, Jack Charlton, on a BBC documentary of Moore's life in and outside of football, said of Moore's death:

Well, I only ever cried over two people, Billy Bremner and Bob... [long pause] He was a lovely man.

On 28 June 1993, his memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey, attended by all the other members of the 1966 World Cup team. He was only the second sportsman to be so honoured, the first being the West Indian cricketer Sir Frank Worrell.

The Bobby Moore Fund is a charity in the United Kingdom, formed in 1993 by Stephanie Moore, and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) in memory of her late husband to raise money for research into bowel cancer and also public awareness of the disease. A campaign, "Make Bobby Proud" was initiated in 2013 to fundraise. As of February 2013 the Bobby Moore Fund had raised £18.8m towards bowel cancer research.

In 1996, comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel used the line "But I still see that tackle by Moore" in the lyrics to their song "Three Lions", which was the England team's official song at the 1996 European Championships, which was adopted by fans rather than the tournament's official song "We're In This Together" by Simply Red. It referred to the famous incident with Jairzinho in 1970, and was re-created by Baddiel, Skinner and England left back Stuart Pearce for the video. It was written in the context of a list of great England moments of the past as proof that England could win a tournament again.

Moore was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player. The same year he was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of England by The Football Association as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.

On 28 April 2003, Prince Andrew as president of The Football Association unveiled the "World Cup Sculpture" (also called "The Champions") in a prominent place near the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. It depicts Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. The one and a half-size bronze was sculpted by Philip Jackson after a famous photograph taken just after the 1966 final at the old Wembley. The south bank at West Ham's ground up until 2016, the Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, was named the Bobby Moore Stand shortly after Moore's death.
On Friday 11 May 2007, a statue of Bobby Moore was unveiled by Sir Bobby Charlton outside the entrance of the newly reconstructed Wembley Stadium as the "finishing touch" to the project, with the stadium officially opening on Saturday 19 May with the staging of the 2007 FA Cup Final. The twice life-size bronze statue, also sculpted by Jackson, depicts Moore looking down Wembley Way.

In August 2008 West Ham United officially retired the number 6 shirt as a mark of respect, 15 years after his death.
On 26 July 2016, Moore became the first footballer to be honoured with an English Heritage Blue Plaque outside his home. The plaque was unveiled on a brick wall at Moore's childhood home in Waverley Gardens, Barking in a ceremony attended by his daughter, Roberta.
In April 2017 airline Norwegian announced Moore's image would appear on the tail fin one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Moore is one of the company's six "British tail fin heroes", joining Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, children's author Roald Dahl, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson, novelist Jane Austen and aviation entrepreneur Freddie Laker. In 2018, Moore was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports' "FIFA" video game "FIFA 19".







Moore appeared in the 1981 film "Escape to Victory", as Terry Brady, and in cameo roles, as himself, in several episodes of "Till Death Do Us Part", including one of its spin-off films "The Alf Garnett Saga".

"Tina and Bobby", a television drama series about Tina and Bobby Moore's relationship, was broadcast on ITV in January 2017. The part of Bobby Moore is played by Lorne MacFadyen.

Moore met his first wife, Tina, in 1957 and they married on 30 June 1962. They lived in a house in Chigwell, Essex, called Morlands. They had a daughter, Roberta, and a son, Dean.

They separated in 1984, and divorced in 1986. He began a relationship with Stephanie Parlane-Moore (eight years his junior) after the collapse of his marriage to Tina, and they were married on 4 December 1991 until his death just over a year later.

Eighteen years after Moore's death, his son Dean was found dead in his flat on 28 July 2011. It is believed that his son, who was 43, had a medical condition and may have died from natural causes.

Martin Peters

Martin Stanford Peters (born 8 November 1943) is an English former footballer and manager and a member of the England team which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup as well as playing in the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Born in Plaistow, Essex, he played club football for West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and Sheffield United. He briefly managed Sheffield United before retiring from professional football in 1981.

Known as "the complete midfielder" as he could pass the ball well with either foot, was good in the air and difficult to mark because of his movement. A free kick specialist, Peters was described by England manager Sir Alf Ramsey, after a game against Scotland in 1968, as being "ten years ahead of his time". His versatility was such that while he was at West Ham he played in every position in the team, including goalkeeper in his third game, replacing an injured Brian Rhodes. With his transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, he became Britain's first £200,000 footballer.

Under manager Ted Fenton, Peters came through the productive ranks at West Ham United after signing as an apprentice in 1959. He made his debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4–1 home win against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6–1 away win at Manchester City on 8 September 1962.

Peters played only five games in his first season with West Ham and although he played 32 league games in season 1963–4 he played no part in their FA Cup run and was not selected for the FA Cup final of 1964 at Wembley, in which West Ham beat Preston North End 3–2. The following year, however, he established himself as a first team regular and was victorious at Wembley when West Ham won the European Cup Winners Cup with victory over 1860 Munich. He was usually partnered in midfield by Eddie Bovington and Ronnie Boyce.

Peters began to impose himself on West Ham's game, and another chance for silverware came in 1966 when West Ham reached the League Cup final. The occasion was still a two-legged affair with each of the finalists hosting a leg (though this changed to a one-off final at Wembley a year later), and Peters played in both matches. He scored in the second game but opponents West Bromwich Albion emerged as 5–3 winners on aggregate. The 1968–69 season saw Peters's only hat-trick for West Ham in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion. It was also his most prolific season, 24 goals coming from 48 games.

Feeling he was in the shadows of Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst, Peters sought out a new challenge. In March 1970, West Ham received a record-breaking £200,000 (£150,000 cash) for Peters from Tottenham Hotspur and Peters moved to White Hart Lane, with Spurs and England striker Jimmy Greaves (valued at £50,000) going the other way. On 21 March 1970 Peters scored on his Spurs debut against Coventry City. He won his first domestic winners' medal in 1971 when Spurs beat Aston Villa 2–0 in the League Cup final. Spurs beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–2 on aggregate to win the 1972 UEFA Cup in what remained the only all-English European final until Manchester United beat Chelsea in the UEFA Champion's League Final, 2008. In 1973, Peters won the League Cup again with Spurs. He completed one more season with Spurs – losing the 1974 UEFA Cup final to Feyenoord on aggregate – before moving to Norwich City – managed by his former West Ham teammate John Bond – in March 1975 for £50,000.

Peters, now aged 31, made his debut appearance for Norwich on 15 March 1975 in a 1–1 away draw to Manchester United. He helped newly promoted Norwich establish themselves in the First Division, making more than 200 appearances, and earning a testimonial against an all-star team which included most of the 1966 World Cup winning England XI. He was voted Norwich City F.C. Player of the Season two years running, in 1976 and 1977, and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. In 1978, whilst still a Norwich City player, Peters was awarded an MBE for services to association football.

He joined Sheffield United on 31 July 1980 as player-coach with the intention of replacing Harry Haslam as manager. His first appearance came in a 2–1 victory against Hull City on 2 August 1980 in the Anglo-Scottish Cup and his League debut came in the opening match of the season in a Division Three fixture against Carlisle United. He scored once in a 3–0 victory.

Alf Ramsey had seen Peters' potential quickly, and in May 1966 he gave the young midfielder his debut for England against Yugoslavia at Wembley. England won 2–0 and Peters had an outstanding debut. Nearly scoring twice he set up chances for Jimmy Greaves and for others. In the final preparation period for Ramsey prior to naming his squad for the World Cup, Peters played in two more of the scheduled warm-up games. Against Finland, he scored his first international goal in what was only his second appearance, and subsequently he made Ramsey's squad for the competition, as did his West Ham teammates Bobby Moore (the England captain) and Geoff Hurst.

Though Peters did not play in the opening group game against Uruguay, the drab 0–0 draw prompted Ramsey into changes. The England coach had been toying with using a system which allowed narrow play through the centre, not operating with conventional wingers but instead with fitter, centralised players who could show willing in defence as well as spread the ball and their runs in attack. Peters therefore had become an ideal player for this 4–1-3-2 system, elegant in his distribution and strong in his forward running, yet showing the stamina, discipline and pace to get back and help the defence when required. This system was dubbed "the wingless wonders".

Ramsey put Peters in the team for his fourth cap, for the second group game against Mexico, which England won 2–0. He kept his place as England got through their group, scraped past a violent Argentina side in the quarter finals (Peters' late cross set up Hurst's header for the only goal) and beat Portugal in the last four. The Germans awaited in the final.

A tense but open game at Wembley saw the score at 1–1 in the final quarter of an hour when England won a corner. Alan Ball delivered it to the edge of the area to Hurst, who tried a shot on the turn. The ball deflected high into the air and bounced down into the penalty area where Peters rifled home a half-volley. The Germans equalised in the final seconds, though glory would still come the team's way with the 4–2 win in extra time, and Hurst – like Peters, winning only his eighth cap – completing a historic hat-trick.

In the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico Peters played in England's three group games from which they qualified again with West Germany waiting in the last eight. Peters scored against the Germans again early in the second half – a run and finish from behind a defender which no West German player had spotted – to establish a 2–0 lead, but later Ramsey committed a tactical error by substituting Peters and Bobby Charlton with Colin Bell and Norman Hunter, and West Germany won 3–2 in extra-time.

In 1972, Peters won his 50th England cap in a qualifier for the 1972 European Championships, beating Switzerland 3–2. England failed to progress due to another defeat against West Germany, who went on to win the tournament. International disappointment for Peters was tempered mildly by more club success, and he scored the only goal as England beat Scotland at Wembley on 19 May 1973. It was his 20th goal for his country and would prove to be his last. England had been stuttering in their qualifying campaign for the 1974 World Cup, dropping points in a drawn game against Wales and then a 2–0 defeat against Poland in Chorzów on 6 June 1973. England needed to defeat Poland at Wembley on 17 October 1973 to qualify for the finals in Germany and, with an out-of-form Moore dropped from the side (he'd only play once more subsequently for his country) Peters captained the side for the crucial game. A defensive error allowed Poland to score and only a penalty allowed England to level up quickly. Allan Clarke scored from it, but England could not get the crucial winning goal. Poland went through after the match finished 1–1 meaning Peters would not play in a third successive World Cup competition.
At the age of 30, Peters' career at the highest level began to slip away. He played three more games for England, reaching a total of 67 caps, though his career with his country ended, on 18 May 1974, as England lost 2–0 against Scotland at Hampden Park.

His wait to become manager was not long, his final game coming against Gillingham on 17 January 1981 which Haslam was too ill to attend, and at which there were demonstrations from the Sheffield United fans. Peters retired to take up the manager's job the following day with United 12th in the table with 16 games to play, but was unable to halt the decline already in place, winning just three of the remaining games. For the first and only time in their history Sheffield United were relegated to the Fourth Division, and Peters resigned. On his retirement from professional football in January 1981, after a distinguished and injury-free career, he had made 882 appearances in total, scoring 220 goals. After he quit Sheffield United Peters spent the 1982–83 season playing in defence for Gorleston in the Eastern Counties League.

In 1984, he moved into the insurance business where he stayed until he was made redundant in July 2001.

In 1998 Peters joined the board of directors at Spurs, and, although he since stepped down, he remains one of the match-day welcomers in the hospitality suites at the club's White Hart Lane ground. He has also worked in the hospitality suites at Upton Park for West Ham home matches, often attending with his children and grandchildren, all West Ham supporters.

In 2006, Peters published his autobiography, "The Ghost of 66", to critical acclaim.

Peters was inducted, with former manager Ron Greenwood, into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2006 in recognition for his achievements as a player.

In 2016, it was announced that Peters had Alzheimer's disease. Politically, Peters identifies as a conservative.

Trevor Brooking

Sir Trevor David Brooking, (born 2 October 1948) is a former England international footballer, manager, pundit and football administrator; he now works as director of football development in England.

He played most of his career for West Ham United making 647 appearances for the club. He won the 1975 FA Cup and the 1980 FA Cup in which he scored the only goal. He was also the club's player of the season on four occasions and caretaker manager on two occasions in 2003. Brooking played 47 times for England, scoring five times. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1981, elevated to Commander of same order (CBE) in 1999, and knighted in 2004. In 2009 a stand at Upton Park was named after Brooking. Since retiring from playing, he has taken up a number of positions in broadcasting as an on-air analyst and in football and sports administration.

Brooking was born in Barking maternity hospital to mother Margaret and father, Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the Metropolitan Police. Brooking attended Ripple Infants School and left Ilford County High School with 11 O-levels and 2 A-levels. His father took him to see his first West Ham United game at Upton Park, a 1–1 draw against Liverpool on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old. Aged fifteen he trained at both Tottenham and Chelsea. However West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood watched him with scout Wally St Pier, and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies. Despite his parents being offered £500 and a car by manager Tommy Docherty to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee.

Brooking made his debut in place of wide-right Brian Dear on 29 August 1967 in a 3–3 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4–2 away win at Leicester City. His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only hat-trick came on 6 April 1968 in a 5–0 home defeat of Newcastle. During his third season, in December 1969 Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against Nottingham Forest. The club signed Peter Eustace for £90,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected and he considered giving up the game. However he returned to playing and with the departure of Martin Peters to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971–72 season with the purchase of midfielder Tommy Taylor, and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request. However the failure of the defensive partnership between Bobby Moore and Alan Stephenson saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted Hammer of the Year. During the 1972–73 season he came to the attention of Derby County manager Brian Clough, who offered West Ham £400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave. Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson offered £425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him.

He won the FA Cup twice, in 1975 with Brooking scoring a vital goal in a 2–1 win in a 4th round replay away at Swindon Town and 1980; in the latter, he scored another vital goal in a 2–1 win in a third round replay against West Bromwich Albion and the only goal in a 1–0 win over Arsenal in the final with a header. Brooking was a member of the West Ham team which won the Second Division in 1981. He also appeared in the 1975 FA Charity Shield, the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, the 1980 FA Charity Shield and the 1981 Football League Cup Final. His last game for West Ham came on 18 May 1984 in 1–0 home defeat by Everton. In total he made 647 appearances and scoring 102 times, wearing the number 10 jersey, his total appearances for West Ham only beaten by Billy Bonds, Bobby Moore and Frank Lampard Sr. He had a testimonial match against an England XI in October 1977.

Brooking accepted an invitation to play for Blue Star in a Wearside League game against Coundon on 28 April 1985. Blue Star had paid for him to fly to Newcastle as their guest and reportedly paid him an appearance fee of £500.

In 1985 Brooking played briefly for Cork City making two appearances.

Brooking made his England debut on 3 April 1974 in a 0–0 draw against Portugal. He played 47 times, scoring 5 goals but only appeared twice in major tournaments. At Euro 1980 in Italy he played in England's opening game against Belgium which was a 1–1 draw, but was dropped for the second game against Italy which England lost 1–0. Re-instated to the starting eleven against Spain he scored England's first goal in a 2–1 win. Due to injury World Cup 1982 was to see him limited to playing as a substitute against Spain on 5 July 1982. Playing for only the last half-hour of the game, Brooking forced one excellent save from the Spanish goalkeeper, Luis Arconada, but with England needing to win to qualify for the semi-final a 0-0 draw saw them eliminated. This was to be his final international appearance.

Brooking was primarily right-footed, but was comfortable on his left foot. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his controlled passing and midfield authority. Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after Cyril Lord the carpet salesman, as Ron Greenwood told him "you're always on the floor"). He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow baseball player called Boog Powell the team had witnessed during a tour of the USA. He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, Hadleigh, after a television upper class and urbane detective played by Gerald Harper.

In April 2003, after West Ham manager Glenn Roeder collapsed due to a brain tumour, Brooking, having long been on the board at West Ham, briefly took over as caretaker manager. The club were fighting relegation from the Premier League. Brooking took charge of three games. His first game resulted in a 1–0 away win at Manchester City with a goal from Frédéric Kanouté. His second saw West Ham beat Chelsea 1–0, thanks to a goal from Paolo Di Canio. The final game of the season saw West Ham draw 2–2 away at Birmingham City resulting in relegation, albeit with 42 points, a record number for a relegated team. After the first three games of the 2003/2004 season with West Ham now in the First Division, Roeder was sacked after West Ham suffered an away defeat to Rotherham United and Brooking was again installed as caretaker manager. He managed for eleven games, losing only once, to Gillingham, a 2–0 away defeat in which Jermain Defoe was sent-off. In October 2003 he was replaced by Alan Pardew, who was appointed on his recommendation.

In 1984, Brooking joined the BBC as a pundit, and has featured on radio and television commentary since, including the BBC's "Match of the Day" and coverage of World Cups and European Championships. He was also the co-commentator in the "Pro Evolution Soccer" video game series, alongside Peter Brackley until "Pro Evolution Soccer 6".

Brooking was Chair of the Eastern Region Council for Sport and Recreation from 1987 until 1997, and between 1999 and 2002 he was chairman of Sport England. In January 2004, he joined the Football Association as Director of Football Development, a role which gave him total of control of coaching and development in English football, as well as a role in appointing future England managers.

He was a key part of the selection process for the successor of the Sven-Göran Eriksson, revealed in May 2006 to be Steve McClaren. In 2004, he was knighted for his services to sport.

In June 1970, he married Hilkka, a Finnish au pair. The couple have two children: Collette and Warren.

In 1970, along with schoolfriend Colin McGowan, Brooking started a book binding company, Colbrook Plastics Limited (now Colbrook Binding Limited), in Basildon, Essex. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Essex in 2001. In October 2014, his autobiography, "Trevor Brooking, My Life in Football", was published.

He was appointed as Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1981, elevated to Commander of same Order (CBE) in 1999, and knighted in 2004.

In November 2015, Brooking was awarded 'Global Football Ambassador' at the 4th annual Football Business Awards.


In 2009 West Ham United announced that from 8 August, the start of the 2009/10 Premier League Season, 'The Centenary Stand' at Upton Park would be named 'The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand' in his honour. The stand was used by away supporters and had been the scene for crowd disturbances. In 2009 in a match between West Ham and Millwall seats were torn out by Millwall fans and hurled towards West Ham fans. In subsequent seasons, Millwall fans were segregated to the upper tier of the stand and kept at least 30 yards from West Ham fans to prevent crowd disturbances. A stand at the Olympic Stadium is also named after Brooking and used by West Ham after their move from the Boleyn Ground from the start of the 2016–17 season.

Geoff Hurst

Sir Geoffrey Charles Hurst (born 8 December 1941) is an English former professional footballer. A striker, he remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, when England recorded a 4–2 victory over West Germany at the old Wembley Stadium in 1966.

Hurst began his career with West Ham United, where he scored 242 goals in 500 first team appearances. There he won the FA Cup in 1964 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. He was sold to Stoke City in 1972 for £80,000. After three seasons with Stoke he finished his Football League career with West Bromwich Albion in 1976. Hurst went to play football in Ireland (Cork Celtic) and the USA (Seattle Sounders) before returning to England to manage non-league Telford United. He also coached in the England set-up before an unsuccessful stint as Chelsea manager from 1979 to 1981. He later coached Kuwait SC before leaving the game to concentrate on his business commitments.

In total he scored 24 goals in 49 England appearances, and as well as success in the 1966 World Cup he also appeared at UEFA Euro 1968 and the 1970 FIFA World Cup. He also had a brief cricket career, making one First-class appearance for Essex in 1962, before concentrating on football.

Hurst was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, on 8 December 1941. He had two younger siblings: Diane and Robert. His family moved to Chelmsford, Essex when he was six years old. His father, Charlie Hurst, was a professional footballer who played at centre-half for Bristol Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale. His mother, Evelyn Hopkins, was from a Gloucestershire family with her mother's side originally from Germany. As a teenager he was obsessed with football, and was once fined £1 for disturbing the peace after consistently kicking a football into his neighbour's garden.

Hurst played one first-class cricket match for Essex, against Lancashire at Aigburth in 1962, although it was not a successful outing: he made 0 not out in the first innings, and was bowled by Colin Hilton, again for 0, in the second. However, he appeared 23 times in the Essex Second XI between 1962 and 1964, usually as a wicketkeeper, before concentrating entirely on football.

Under his father's management of the club, Hurst played once for Halstead Town reserves at the age of "about 14".

Hurst's football career began when he was apprenticed to West Ham United at the age of 15. Manager Ted Fenton first selected him for a senior game in a Southern Floodlit Cup tie with Fulham in December 1958. He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid £7 a week with a £20 signing on fee. His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3–1. He made only two further appearances in the 1959–60 season, and realised that Bobby Moore was making better progress in the same position than he was. He played six times in the 1960–61 campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket. In April 1961 Ron Greenwood took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.

Hurst missed the start of 1961–62 pre-season training due to his cricketing commitments, but went on to make 24 appearances at left-half, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in December 1961. However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the 1962–63 season. In September of that season Greenwood tried playing Hurst as a striker after deciding that the defensive side of his game was a weakness for the young midfielder. He formed a successful partnership with Johnny Byrne and went on to score 13 goals in 27 First Division games whilst Byrne scored nine in 30 games in the 1962–63 season. In the summer of 1963 he joined the club on their pre-season tour of New York, and greatly benefited from playing against top quality players from clubs across the world in the International Soccer League, a friendly tournament.

Hurst and West Ham had a poor start to the 1963–64 season, and went on to finish in 14th place. However it was in the FA Cup where the team impressed. A comfortable 3–0 home win over Second Division Charlton Athletic was followed by another 3–0 home win over East End rivals Leyton Orient – though only following a tough 1–1 draw at Brisbane Road. Greenwood named the same 11 players, including Hurst, in all the club's seven FA Cup fixtures as West Ham progressed to the final. Hurst scored one against Charlton and two against Orient, and claimed another goal in the Fifth Round as West Ham beat Second Division Swindon Town 3–1 at the County Ground. Burnley provided a stern test in the quarter-finals, but a 3–2 home win took West Ham into the semi-finals, where they faced Manchester United at Hillsborough. West Ham won 3–1, with Hurst scoring the final goal of the game after being set up by Bobby Moore. West Ham faced Second Division Preston North End at Wembley in the 1964 FA Cup Final, and had to come from behind twice to win the match 3–2. Hurst scored his side's second equaliser with a header that bounced under the crossbar and ended up just over the goal line.

The club's success won them a place in the European Cup Winners Cup for the 1964–65 season. They defeated Belgian side K.A.A. Gent in the First Round after an unconvincing 2–1 aggregate victory. Czechoslovakian side AC Sparta Prague awaited in the second round, and West Ham progressed with a 3–2 aggregate victory despite the absence of Moore. Despite beating Swiss team FC Lausanne-Sport 6–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hurst had still not registered a goal in the competition as he was played in a withdrawn role behind Johnny Byrne so as to strengthen the midfield. In the semi-finals, West Ham defended a 2–1 home win over Spanish club Real Zaragoza with a 1–1 draw at La Romareda to claim a place in the 1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final against TSV 1860 München at Wembley. West Ham won 2–0, Alan Sealey scoring both goals, to give the club their first European trophy.

Having scored 40 goals in 59 competitive games in the 1965–66 season and then gone on to make himself a household name by winning the World Cup with England, Hurst was the subject of a £200,000 transfer offer by Manchester United manager Matt Busby – the offer was rejected by Greenwood. He was in the West Ham side which lost the League Cup final 5–3 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion.

In the 1966–67 season, West Ham demonstrated the inconsistency that would deny them a realistic prospect of winning a league championship under Greenwood. Hurst scored a hat-trick as they defeated full-strength title challengers Leeds United 7–0 in the League Cup, but they exited the FA Cup with a 3–1 defeat to Third Division side Swindon Town.

Hurst scored six goals in a First Division match against Sunderland at Upton Park on 19 October 1968, which West Ham won 8–0. However, he regretted admitting that he handled the ball in his first goal which led to the back page headlines focusing on the illegitimate goal rather than the rare feat of one player scoring six goals in one game.

In 1972, West Ham reached the semi-finals of the League Cup when they played Stoke City over two legs. In the home leg at Upton Park, they were awarded a penalty after Harry Redknapp was fouled in the box. Hurst took the penalty and struck a powerful shot into the top corner which was saved by Gordon Banks, who succeeded in deflecting the ball over the bar. Stoke won the tie in the subsequent replay and denied Hurst one more final appearance at Wembley.

Hurst was sold to Stoke City for a £80,000 fee in August 1972. He was struck down with pneumonia early in 1973 and went to South Africa to recover, playing on loan for Roy Bailey's Cape Town City. He missed just four games for Stoke and upon his return he helped the side to maintain their First Division status.

In January 1974, "Potters" manager Tony Waddington asked Hurst to take in new signing Alan Hudson as a lodger so as to provide the talented but troubled midfielder with a stable home during his Stoke career. Hudson adapted well to life in the Hurst household and Stoke recorded a fifth place in the 1973–74 season – a career high for Hurst.

Hurst scored 11 goals in 41 games in the 1974–75 season and helped Stoke to finish in fifth place, just four points behind champions Derby County.

Hurst was sold to Johnny Giles's West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 1975 for a fee of £20,000. He played 12 times for the Baggies at the start of the 1975–76 season, scoring twice, before deciding to leave for America. Hurst later acknowledged that at the age of 34 he was too old to lead the line in the "Baggies" push for promotion out of the Second Division.

Hurst signed for Cork Celtic in January 1976, and remained in Ireland for one month.

He signed for the Seattle Sounders of the NASL in 1976. Hurst rapidly proved his worth, and became a valuable member of the Sounders team. He was the team's second-leading scorer, helping the Sounders make it to the play-offs for the first time in their brief history, with eight goals and four assists in 23 regular season games, and one goal in the play-offs.

Hurst made his senior England debut against West Germany on 23 February 1966. He played well, and further performances against Scotland and Yugoslavia secured him a place in the squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. However, he put in mediocre performances in warm-up games against Finland and Denmark, and so Jimmy Greaves and Roger Hunt were instead picked for the final friendly game against Poland. Greaves and Hunt were indeed picked for the three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, but in the later game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter final against Argentina.

Argentina were talented but preferred a tougher approach to the game, which saw them reduced to ten men. The game was still tightly contested as it entered its final 15 minutes, but then Martin Peters swung over a curling cross from the left flank and Hurst, anticipating his clubmate's action, got in front of his marker to glance a near post header past the Argentine keeper. England won 1–0 and were in the semi-finals.

Greaves was not fit for the game against Portugal so Hurst and Hunt continued up front, and England won 2–1 thanks to two goals by Bobby Charlton, the second of which was set up by Hurst. As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves' return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst's contribution, started to call for the return of England's most prolific centre forward. Ramsey, however, would not be swayed and selected Hurst for the final.

West Germany took the lead through Helmut Haller early on, but six minutes later Bobby Moore was fouled just inside the German half of the field. He quickly picked himself up and delivered the free kick to Hurst, who eluded his marker 
Horst-Dieter Höttges and headed the ball past goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski to level the scores at 1–1.

With 12 minutes left to play of normal time, an Alan Ball corner left Hurst with a shooting opportunity on the edge of the penalty area; his shot deflected off Wolfgang Weber and fell kindly to Martin Peters, who put the ball into the net to give England the lead. However the Germans scored a very late goal through Weber to level the match at 2–2 at full-time.

In the first period of extra-time, Ball made a cross across the near post to Hurst, who struck a strong shot towards goal with his right foot, falling backwards as he did so. The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner. England's players claimed a goal whilst the Germans were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line. Referee Gottfried Dienst consulted his linesman on the right flank, Tofiq Bahramov, who signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and the goal was given.

The Germans pushed forward in search of an equaliser as the full-time whistle approached, and Bobby Moore exploited their advanced position to send Hurst a long ball in the German half of the pitch. Hurst reached the German penalty box and fired a powerful shot in the expectation that it would sail over the crossbar and waste time as the match drew to a close; the ball instead struck a divot as it bounced in front of Hurst and the shot connected well enough to beat the goalkeeper and hit the net to end the game at 4–2 to England. As Hurst collected the pass, BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme immortalised his own contribution to the day with one of the most famous pieces of football commentary:

Hurst was selected for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not play as England lost 1–0 to Yugoslavia in the semi-final. He did play, and score, in the 2–0 third-place play-off victory over the Soviet Union at the Stadio Olimpico.

Hurst scored his second international hat-trick on 12 March 1969, in a 5–0 victory over France, and was named in the Ramsey squad which played in Mexico to defend the World Cup in 1970. He scored the only goal of England's opening game against Romania after being sent through by a pass from Francis Lee. England progressed to the quarter finals, where once again they faced West Germany. Hurst played a part in the Martin Peters goal that put England 2–0 up. With England up 2–1, Hurst's contested header trickled inches past the post. Later, at 2–2, Hurst had what many thought was a legitimate goal ruled out for offside. The West Germans scored in extra time and won 3–2.

Hurst scored against Greece and Switzerland in qualification for UEFA Euro 1972, but played his last international match on 29 April 1972 as England were beaten 3–1 by West Germany – he was replaced by Rodney Marsh with 20 minutes left to play and did not take to the field in an England shirt again. He was named in the squad for the second leg against West Germany after Allan Clarke and Francis Lee picked up injuries, but had to pull out of the squad after picking up an injury himself.

Upon his retirement from playing, Hurst moved into management and coaching. He spent three years as player-manager of Telford United in the Southern League before being recruited by Ron Greenwood in the England coaching set up in 1977. He travelled with England to help Greenwood at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where England failed to make it past the group stages on both occasions.

Hurst joined Chelsea, then in the Second Division, before the 1979–80 season, initially as assistant manager to Danny Blanchflower. When Blanchflower was sacked, Hurst was appointed manager. He hired Bobby Gould as his assistant. Things initially went well, and for much of the season Chelsea were on course for promotion, but two wins from their final seven league games ensured the club finished fourth. He raised £250,000 through the sales of Eamonn Bannon, David Stride and Trevor Aylott. He then spent £300,000 on Colin Lee, Dennis Rofe and Colin Viljoen; he later acknowledged Viljoen as a mistake whilst bemoaning Lee's bad luck with injury.

The following season again began well, with the "Blues" among the early promotion pace-setters before a dismal run set in, with Chelsea scoring in just three of their final 22 league matches, culminating in Hurst being sacked on 30 April 1981 and Chelsea finished 12th in the league.

After being sacked from Chelsea on 23 April 1981 Hurst worked as an insurance salesman for Abbey Life. The next year he was tempted back into management after being offered a generous salary by Kuwait SC. He controversially disciplined and dropped club captain Saad Al-Houti, but was unable to challenge Dave Mackay's Al-Arabi for dominance of the Kuwaiti Premier League. After leaving Kuwait in April 1984 he returned to the insurance trade.

In 2003 Hurst was included in "The Champions", a statue of 1966 World Cup winning footballers, by sculptor Philip Jackson. It sits at the junctions of Barking Road and Central Park Road, Newham, London, near to the site of West Ham United's former home stadium, the Boleyn Ground and features Martin Peters, Hurst, Bobby Moore and Ray Wilson.

Hurst's contribution to the English game was recognised in 2004 when he was inducted in the English Football Hall of Fame. Hurst is also one of the few footballers who have been knighted.

A statue of Hurst was unveiled outside Curzon Ashton F.C.'s ground in 2010. He is shown alongside two other World Cup winners born in the area, fellow 1966 squad member Jimmy Armfield, and Simone Perrotta, who won it with Italy in 2006.

He now lives in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, with his wife Judith. They have been married since 13 October 1964, having met three years previously at a youth centre; Eddie Presland was best man. They have three daughters.

Paolo Di Canio

Paolo Di Canio (born 9 July 1968) is an Italian football manager and former professional footballer. During his playing career he made over 500 league appearances and scored over one hundred goals appearing primarily as a deep-lying forward but could also play as an attacking midfielder, or as a winger. A talented yet controversial player, Di Canio was known for his creativity, technical ability, and dribbling skills, as well as his temperamental character, tenacity and aggression on the pitch.

Di Canio began his career in the Italian Serie A, playing for Lazio, Juventus, Napoli and A.C. Milan, before a brief spell with the Scottish club Celtic. He subsequently spent seven years in the English Premier League with Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham United and Charlton Athletic. He returned to Italy in 2004, playing for Lazio and Cisco Roma before retiring in 2008. He played for the Italian under-21s, making 9 appearances and scoring 2 goals, and was notably a member of the squad that finished in third place at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship under manager Cesare Maldini, but was never capped for the senior team.

Among the individual awards he received as a player, Di Canio was named SPFA Players' Player of the Year in 1997 and West Ham's player of the season in 2000. However, his career was at times characterised by controversy: he received an eleven-match ban in 1998 for pushing a referee and attracted negative publicity over his self allegiance to fascism.

In 2011, Di Canio entered football management in England with Swindon Town, guiding them in his first full season as manager to promotion to League One. He was appointed as the Sunderland manager at the end of March 2013. His controversial appointment lasted 13 games until he was sacked on 22 September after Sunderland had won only three games under his managership.

Di Canio was born in Rome, in the district of Quarticciolo, a working-class area populated mainly by A.S. Roma fans. However, Di Canio was drawn to their local rivals S.S. Lazio. As a young boy, he was addicted to cola and similar drinks and called "Pallocca", a slang term meaning "lard-ball". He was fat, and knock-kneed, and needed to wear orthopedic shoes – "But I never hid. My response was to exercise; to try to become the kind of person I am."

He signed for Lazio in 1985 and remained there until 1990. Lazio won promotion to Serie A in 1988, having narrowly escaped relegation to Serie C1 the year before. He finally made his first-team debut in October 1988 and went on to play 30 games during the 1988–89 season. Di Canio scored the winner in the first Rome derby of the season, a goal which contributed to Lazio's survival in Serie A that season and earning him hero status. In 1990, he was sold to another of Italy's biggest clubs, Juventus; although he won the UEFA Cup with the Turin side in 1993, he struggled to gain playing time during his tenure with the club, due to the presence of other forwards and creative midfielders in the team, such as Roberto Baggio, Salvatore Schillaci, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Gianluca Vialli, and Andreas Möller. He left Juventus after an "animated exchange" with then manager Giovanni Trapattoni and spent the 1993–94 season with Napoli. Two seasons followed at A.C. Milan, where, despite winning the Serie A title in 1996, he once again struggled to gain playing time due to heavy competition from his teammates, culminating in another row, this time with Fabio Capello.

In July 1996 he joined Celtic in Scotland, and enjoyed a successful season in Glasgow, scoring 15 goals in 37 appearances and winning the SPFA Player of the Year award. His time in Glasgow was dogged by controversy though; sent-off during a 2–2 draw against Hearts in November 1996 and heavily involved in an acrimonious league match against Rangers in March 1997 where he behaved aggressively towards Ian Ferguson and gestured in the direction of Rangers’ bench as he was led from the field by teammates. The Italian was called to the referee’s room after the teams had returned to the dressing room and was shown another yellow card in addition to the one he had received earlier in the game. Di Canio then demanded a large wage rise at the end of the season, but this was rebuffed by Celtic. He then refused to join the Celtic squad in the Netherlands for their pre-season training during July 1997.

On 6 August 1997, Di Canio moved to the English Premiership as he joined Sheffield Wednesday in a transfer deal valued at around £4.2 million. Whilst in Sheffield, Di Canio was the club's leading goal scorer for the 1997–98 season with 14 goals and he became a favourite of the fans.

In September 1998, Di Canio pushed referee Paul Alcock to the ground after being sent off while playing for Sheffield Wednesday against Arsenal at Hillsborough, which resulted in an extended ban of 11 matches and him being fined £10,000.

In January 1999, Di Canio signed for West Ham United for £1.5 million. He had not played football since his ban following his push on Paul Alcock. West Ham manager, Harry Redknapp on signing Di Canio admitted he was taking a chance but said of the player "He can do things with the ball that people can only dream of". Di Canio said of his ban, "I made a mistake and I'm sorry, West Ham have given me a big chance and I'm very happy" He scored his first goal for West Ham on 27 February 1999 in his fourth game. Playing against Blackburn Rovers, Di Canio made the first goal in a 2–0 win, for Ian Pearce in the 27th minute and scored the second in the 31st minute. He helped them to achieve a high league position (5th) and qualify for the UEFA Cup through the Intertoto Cup. He was also the OPTA player of the season 1998–99. He scored the BBC Goal of the Season in March 2000 with a flying volley against Wimbledon, which is still considered among the best goals in Premiership history and was named as the Premiership's goal of the decade in a December 2009 Sky Sports News viewers' poll, scoring 30% of votes. In this season he was also voted Hammer of the Year by the club's fans.

In December 2000, late in a game against Everton and with both sides vying for the winning goal, Di Canio shunned a goal-scoring opportunity and stopped play, grabbing the ball from a cross inside the box, as the Everton goalkeeper Paul Gerrard was laying injured on the ground after he twisted his knee attempting a clearance on the edge of the box. The Goodison Park crowd reacted with a standing ovation. FIFA officially lauded Di Canio's gesture, describing it as "a special act of good sportsmanship," and awarded him next year the FIFA Fair Play Award.

Sir Alex Ferguson tried to sign him for Manchester United halfway through the 2001–02 season, but his attempts were unsuccessful and Di Canio remained in East London for another season and a half.

In 2003, with the Hammers struggling at the bottom of the league, Di Canio had a very public row with manager Glenn Roeder and was dropped from the first team. However, he returned at the end of the season (after Roeder, stricken by a brain tumour, was replaced by Trevor Brooking) and scored a winner against Chelsea in the penultimate game of the season, a game that boosted West Ham's chances of staying in the Premiership. However, they were relegated on the final day of the season after a 2–2 draw away to Birmingham City, where Di Canio scored an 89th-minute equaliser. He was released on a free transfer and signed with Charlton Athletic for the start of 2003–04.

In his one season at The Valley, Di Canio helped Charlton Athletic finish the season in 7th position, the club's highest league finish since the 1950s. However, he only scored four league goals for the Addicks, all of which came from the penalty spot (one from a rebound). one of the penalty kicks was an audacious 'Panenka' style penalty kick against Arsenal. Di Canio however continued to be a provider of goals as well, notably in October 2003 when he came on as second-half substitute with Charlton trailing 0–1 away at Portsmouth. He provided most of the spark for Charlton's much-improved second-half display, and after Jonathan Fortune had equalised for Charlton, it was from Di Canio's corner kick in the last minute that Shaun Bartlett headed home the winning goal.

Even though he had already signed an extension to his Charlton contract, in August 2004 he returned to his home team of Lazio taking a massive pay cut in order to return to the economically stretched Roman team. Lazio fans were happy to have a Rome-bred Lazio supporter in the team again, something missing since the departure of Alessandro Nesta in 2002. He scored in the Rome derby, just as he had in 1989, leading the team to a 3–1 victory over A.S. Roma in January (6 January 2005). However the negative publicity that Di Canio generated for Lazio, including his intimate relationship with club's ultras and their increased influence thanks to his presence in the team, coupled with problems with some teammates and coaches, exasperated club president and majority shareholder, Claudio Lotito, with whom he already had a difficult relationship. As a result, Di Canio's contract was not renewed in the summer of 2006. During several of his games for Lazio – including during goal celebrations – Di Canio made a fascist salute to their right-wing fans. He subsequently signed with Cisco Roma of Serie C2 on a free transfer. In his first season with Cisco Roma, his team failed promotion to playoffs, despite a runners-up position in the regular season. He subsequently agreed to stay with Cisco for another season, in a second attempt to win promotion to Serie C1 with the Roman side.

On 10 March 2008, Di Canio announced his retirement from football, ending his 23-year playing career before the end of the season due to physical issues. It was his intention to begin coaching lessons at Coverciano to gain a coaching position. In an interview he revealed that his dream would be to manage former club West Ham, and applied for the position after the resignation of Alan Curbishley in September 2008. Di Canio played in Tony Carr's testimonial game at Upton Park on 5 May 2010, which featured a West Ham team against West Ham Academy old boys. He played for both sides during the match. The West Ham team won 5–1. In July 2010, in honour of Di Canio, West Ham announced the opening of the Paolo Di Canio Lounge, within the West Stand, at their Upton Park ground, which was formally launched by the unveiling of a plaque by Di Canio himself, on 11 September 2010.

On 20 May 2011, Di Canio was appointed manager of Swindon Town on a two-year contract, following the club's relegation to League Two. Di Canio began his career as a manager with a 3–0 win over Crewe Alexandra on 6 August 2011. On 30 August 2011, Di Canio was involved in a pitch-side altercation with Swindon striker Leon Clarke after their defeat in the League Cup to Southampton. In January 2012, Swindon caused a FA Cup shock by defeating Premier League club Wigan Athletic 2–1. Di Canio stated that he believed his players deserved to have their names put on the stadium and dedicated the victory to his father, who died late in 2011. He was sent to the stands later in the month in a league game against Macclesfield Town for vociferously venting his frustration at his side not being awarded a free-kick. Swindon won the match 1–0 and with over half the season gone, his team were fighting for promotion to League One.

Under Di Canio, Swindon reached the 2012 Football League Trophy Final, where they were defeated 2–0 by Chesterfield.

On 21 April 2012, Swindon were promoted to the League One after Crawley Town's 1–1 draw with Dagenham & Redbridge and Torquay United's 2–0 loss to AFC Wimbledon, despite Di Canio's side having lost 3–1 to Gillingham on the same day. He dedicated the promotion to his parents, his mother having died shortly after his father in April of that year. One week later, Swindon won the Football League Two thanks to an emphatic 5–0 victory over Port Vale. Swindon finished the season on 93 points.

Although in the 2012–13 season, Swindon were knocked out of the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy in their first game against opposition from lower leagues, they did have a solid run in the League Cup in which they won against three teams from higher leagues. They beat Brighton & Hove Albion 3–0, won against Stoke City 3–4 after extra time, and beat Burnley 3–1 before narrowly missing out against Aston Villa 3–2 at home.

In January 2013, with Swindon under a transfer embargo and in financial difficulty, Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players John Bostock, Chris Martin, and Danny Hollands at the club.

On 18 January 2013, ahead of Swindon's Saturday clash with Shrewsbury Town, Di Canio worked into the night alongside approximately 200 volunteers to clear a snow-covered pitch at the County Ground, thus allowing the game to go ahead. He showed his appreciation by ordering everyone pizza. Swindon won the match 2–0, which Di Canio publicly deemed a present to the volunteers.

In January 2013, the Swindon Town chairman announced that due to financial difficulties, no money would be made available for future signings. Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players at the club. With the possibility of the club entering administration, a new buyer was found, subject to Football League approval, and without the knowledge of Di Canio, player Matt Ritchie was sold to Bournemouth. Further attempts to sign players by Di Canio were rejected by the Football League due to the club's financial situation with Di Canio "considering his future" at Swindon due to off-field financial problems. In February, Di Canio offered his resignation but said he would withdraw this if approval for the new owners, by the Football League, was received by 18 February. This did not happen and he resigned as manager of Swindon Town.

On 31 March 2013, Sunderland appointed Di Canio as manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract, following the dismissal of Martin O'Neill the previous day. The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club vice-chairman David Miliband due to Di Canio's "past political statements". The appointment of Di Canio also sparked opposition from the Durham Miners' Association, which decided to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Wearmouth Colliery, as a symbol of its anger over the appointment. The background to the opposition was past statements made by Di Canio supporting fascism.

Di Canio was tasked with keeping Sunderland in the Premier League, following a run of only three points from a possible 24. His first game as manager of Sunderland resulted in a 2–1 away defeat to Chelsea. Di Canio's second game in charge was the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle United at St James' Park on 14 April. Sunderland defeated their fierce rivals 3–0, their first away victory in the fixture in over a decade. Each goal sparked wild celebrations from Di Canio and the Sunderland bench. Di Canio then got his first win at the Stadium of Light against Everton.

Although the team did not win the next three matches, including drawing the final two home games and a heavy 6–1 defeat to Aston Villa, Sunderland secured their Premier League survival when Wigan Athletic were defeated at Arsenal and relegated, trailing then-17th placed Sunderland by four points with only one game to play.

For the 2013–14 season, Di Canio signed fourteen new players and sold experienced players such as Simon Mignolet, James McClean and Stéphane Sessègnon. After five league games, Sunderland had gained only a single point, from an away draw with Southampton. Di Canio was dismissed on 22 September 2013, the day after the fifth match of the season, a 3–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, and only his 13th match in charge. Sunderland chief executive officer Margaret Byrne stated that Di Canio had been sacked after senior players had approached her and that his situation became untenable due to his "brutal and vitriolic" criticism of the squad. Di Canio denies this.

Di Canio was linked with the Celtic job in May 2014, and applied for vacant managerial positions at Bolton Wanderers in October 2014, Rotherham United in September 2015 and Rotherham again in February 2016.

In 2005, he characterised his political views by declaring that he was "a fascist, not a racist".

His use of the Roman salute toward Lazio supporters, a gesture adopted by Italian fascists in the 20th century, has created controversy. Documented uses of the salute include in matches against arch-rivals Roma and Livorno, a club inclined to left-wing politics. Di Canio received a one-match ban after the second event and was fined €7,000. He was later quoted as saying, "I will always salute as I did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people ... I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values, values of civility against the standardisation that this society imposes upon us." His salute has been featured on unofficial merchandise sold outside Stadio Olimpico after the ban.

He has also expressed admiration for the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. In his autobiography, he praised Mussolini as "basically a very principled, ethical individual" who was "deeply misunderstood".

In 2010, Di Canio attended the funeral of senior fascist Paolo Signorelli, where mourners were photographed making mass fascist salutes towards Signorelli's coffin. Signorelli had been convicted of involvement in the Bologna massacre, a neo-fascist terrorist attack which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200.

Di Canio's political ideology has been a source of controversy in the course of his managerial career. When Di Canio was appointed as the manager of Swindon Town in 2011, the trade union GMB terminated its sponsorship agreement with the club, worth around £4,000 per season, due to Di Canio's fascist views.

He was appointed as manager of Sunderland on 31 March 2013. The club's vice-chairman David Miliband, a Labour politician and former foreign secretary, subsequently stepped down. Miliband stated that he had taken the decision to resign "in the light of the new manager's past political statements".

In a profile piece in 2011, an unnamed source asserted that Di Canio was not "an ideological fascist", attributing his behaviour to "his psychological history, particularly his former compulsive tendencies and pronounced mood swings". In the same article, Di Canio said that he was not politically active: "I don't vote, I haven't voted for 14 years. Italian politicians — all of them — think only about themselves, and making money."

Di Canio has several tattoos, including on his right biceps the Latin word ""DUX", meaning "leader"" or, in Italian, Il Duce—a nickname for Benito Mussolini. Sky Sport Italia was forced to apologize after Di Canio appeared as a pundit in September 2016 in a short-sleeved shirt, thus revealing the tattoo to television viewers; he was later suspended by the station. His back is covered with a tattoo of fascist imagery, including an eagle, fasces and a portrait of Mussolini. He also has a West Ham United tattoo on his left upper arm and a tattoo of his father on his chest.

Di Canio has spoken also of the growing influence in his life of Samurai culture, and of the Japanese spiritual mentality from reading Mishima, and the teachings in the traditions of Hagakure and Bushido.

Alan Devonshire

Alan Ernest Devonshire (born 13 April 1956) is an English former professional footballer who is the current manager of Maidenhead United. He was a wide midfielder who played for West Ham United, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1980, and Watford, where he finished his career in 1992. Devonshire won eight caps for England between 1980 and 1983. He subsequently became a manager with Maidenhead United, Hampton & Richmond Borough and Braintree Town.

Born in Park Royal, then a part of Middlesex, Devonshire had been a schoolboy footballer but had been turned away by Crystal Palace at age 14 for being too small. He returned to Selhurst Park two years later and played a couple of youth team games but was again released by the club, this time by former West Ham player and Palace manager, Malcolm Allison. Devonshire started playing for non-league Southall and in doing so came to the attention of league clubs such as Reading, Southampton, and Brentford. By day he worked as a fork-lift truck driver at the Hoover Factory in Perivale, Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United scouts, Eddie Baily and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood. Devonshire signed for West Ham United in 1976 for a fee of £5,000, a transfer which has led to him being referred to as "West Ham's best ever buy".

Devonshire made his debut for West Ham on 27 October 1976 in a League Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers, in which West Ham lost 2–0. He made his League debut three days later on 30 October 1976 against West Bromwich Albion, where he played in a 3–0 defeat. He soon became a fans' favourite, who referred to him by his nickname "Dev". His workman-like attitude was one to which the fans could relate. He also enhanced his rapport with supporters by travelling to home game on the London Underground from his West London home.

He played 29 games in all competitions, without scoring, in his first season, the 1976–77 season. It was a poor season for West Ham who finished only two points above a relegation place in 17th place in the First Division. The following season, the 1977–78 season saw Devonshire's first goals for the club, in a 3–3 at Upton Park on 12 November 1977. It also saw him play 38 games in all competitions, scoring three goals. Unfortunately for West Ham his efforts could not prevent them from relegation to the Second Division after they finished in 20th place. The 1978–79 season saw West Ham rebuilding their side following relegation. Devonshire was a regular member of the side which finished 5th in the Second Division. He had played 41 of a possible 42 league games that season and was voted Hammer of the Season. West Ham failed to gain promotion again in the 1979–80 season. They did however reach the 1980 FA Cup Final where Devonshire collected an FA Cup winner's medal as West Ham beat favourites, holders and Cup Winners Cup finalists Arsenal 1–0 at Wembley with a single goal from Trevor Brooking from a cross by Devonshire. He had also scored a goal in a semi-final replay at Elland Road in a 2–1 win against Everton. 

In the 1980–81 season Devonshire's career flourished. His partnership with Trevor Brooking formed the cornerstone of West Ham's push for promotion back to the First Division. He also played in European football for the first time and was a member of the side which reached to 1981 League Cup Final. He collected a Second Division title medal as they won promotion, losing only four games. Devonshire continued to be a regular member of the West Ham side in the First Division until a game on 7 January 1984. Playing against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup, he snapped three ligaments in his right knee. He tried to make a comeback in March 1985 in two cup games against Wimbledon but again broke down. It was 19 months from his first injury to his full return, in a game against Birmingham City on 17 August 1985. His long spell out injured had resulted in him losing some of his pace but still maintaining his ability to pass the ball well. He made the final pass for many of the goals scored by teammates, Tony Cottee and Frank McAvennie in the 1985–86 season as West Ham finished third in the First Division.

Injury struck Devonshire again in the first game of the 1987–88 season. Just 15 minutes in a game against Queens Park Rangers, he snapped his Achilles tendon. This forced him out of the game for over a year and by the time of his return the West Ham team were in decline. The 1988–89 season saw him play only 20 league game without scoring as West Ham were relegated back to the Second Division. For the 1989–90 season manager John Lyall was replaced by Lou Macari who undertook the rebuilding of the West Ham side. Devonshire was rarely used making only seven league appearances that season. Macari was replaced in the same season by Billy Bonds who granted Devonshire a free transfer in May 1990. His last appearance for West Ham came on 14 February 1990 when he was a substitute for Gary Strodder in a 6–0 away defeat to Oldham Athletic in a League Cup semi-final. His performance, and that of other experienced West Ham players, Liam Brady, Phil Parkes, Alvin Martin and Julian Dicks, was described as "embarrassingly helpless" in a game known as the "St. Valentine's Day massacre". Devonshire had played 448 competitive games over 14 years, scoring 32 goals.

In 1990 Devonshire signed for Watford, where he played for two years before dropping out of league football in 1992. He went on to serve non-league club Chippenham Sports as a player-coach.

Devonshire was selected to play for England by his former manager at West Ham, Ron Greenwood. He made his debut on 20 May 1980 in a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland. Greenwood selected him again on 31 May 1980 in a friendly game against Australia, which England won 2–1. Unfortunately for Devonshire his position and style of play were also those of Glenn Hoddle who was preferred as an international selection. He would have to wait two years for his next cap, on 25 May 1982 in a 2–0 win against Netherlands. Another game followed on 2 June 1982, a 1–1 draw against Iceland. Both of these games were warm-up games before the 1982 World Cup. Devonshire was omitted from the final squad for the tournament. New England manager, Bobby Robson attempting to rebuild an aging England team, selected Devonshire in October 1982. The game, against West Germany finished 2–1 to the Germans in a bad defeat for England. His final two appearances, against Greece and Luxembourg came towards the end of 1983 and were Devonshire's only appearances in competitive international games, the games being qualifiers for the 1984 UEFA European Football Championship.

Devonshire began his management career as manager of non-league club Osterley and Brentford Women. He then became the manager of Hampton & Richmond Borough in the Conference South. He was previously manager of Maidenhead United.

As manager of Hampton & Richmond, he took the club from Isthmian League Division One South to the play-off-final of the Conference South. In his first season, he guided them to fifth place in the Isthmian Division One South which due to re-organization of the leagues was enough to see the club promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division. He then guided the club to a sixth-placed finish in their debut season at that level missing out on the play-offs on goal difference on the final day of the season. The 2005–06 season would see Devonshire take the team into the play-offs. Having won a dramatic play-off semi-final on penalties away to Heybridge Swifts the team then faced Fisher Athletic away who beat Hampton 3–0. Devonshire finally managed to get Hampton & Richmond Borough promoted the following season in style by bringing the Isthmian Premier Division title to the Beveree. In their debut season in the Conference South he has managed to guide his team to third place in the league and into the play-offs for the Conference National.

On 23 May 2011, Devonshire was appointed the manager of newly promoted Conference National club Braintree Town. Having declined the offer of a new contract, Devonshire left the club on 17 April 2015. He was appointed manager of one of his former clubs, National League South side Maidenhead United, on 5 May 2015.

Devonshire's father, Les, was a professional footballer with clubs including Chester City and Crystal Palace.

He has a race horse named after him.
