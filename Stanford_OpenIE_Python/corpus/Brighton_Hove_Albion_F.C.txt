Mathew Ryan

Mathew David Ryan (born 8 April 1992) is an Australian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Brighton & Hove Albion and the Australia national team.

Born in Sydney, Ryan played youth football for Marconi Stallions, Blacktown City and Central Coast Mariners. He made his senior debut for Blacktown before moving to the Mariners' senior squad in 2010. In 2013, Ryan moved to Club Brugge, where he played for two years before joining Valencia.

He made his senior international debut in 2012, and has since established himself as Australia's first-choice goalkeeper, effectively succeeding his childhood idol Mark Schwarzer. He played at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, winning the Best Goalkeeper award at the latter tournament which his country won on home soil.

Ryan was born in Plumpton, New South Wales and attended Westfields Sports High School. He took up football at the age of four and played youth football for Blacktown City and Central Coast Mariners before making his senior debut with Blacktown City. After moving to Central Coast Mariners in 2010, Ryan moved to Club Brugge in 2013.

In addition to holding an Australian passport, Ryan also has a UK passport.

Ryan played for the Central Coast Mariners youth team in the 2009–10 season, and after several call-ups to the senior team, he was given a 3-year senior contract. Despite starting the 2010–11 A-League as the Mariners' substitute keeper, an anterior cruciate ligament injury to first-choice Jess Vanstrattan saw Ryan elevated into the starting eleven. Ryan made his A-League debut for the Mariners on 28 August 2010 in a 1–1 draw against Sydney FC, but fumbled a cross which allowed Rhyan Grant to score Sydney's goal. While coach Graham Arnold was happy with Ryan's debut, there was competition between Ryan and newly-signed Paul Henderson for the regular starting spot. Over the next several months Ryan retained his spot in the starting lineup and earned significant plaudits, including the A-League Young Player of the Month award for December 2010. The Mariners season ended with a penalty shootout loss to Brisbane Roar in the 2011 A-League Grand Final, however, Ryan was awarded the Joe Marston Medal for man of the match in that game. He was also named A-League Young Footballer of the Year for 2010–11.

In October 2011, Ryan was named 2011 Male U20 Player of the Year at the FFA Australian Football Awards. He continued to put in a number of strong performances in the 2011–12 A-League, including a man of the match performance in a 1–0 win over Melbourne Heart on 17 January 2012 after pulling off a number of saves. This contributed to Ryan being named A-League Young Player of the Month for January 2012. The Mariners won the 2011–12 Premiership following a win over Wellington Phoenix in the final round of the regular season. However, they were eliminated in the Preliminary Final against Perth Glory on penalties, despite Ryan scoring his penalty in the shootout. In April 2012, Ryan was named A-League Young Footballer of the Year for the second successive season and A-League Goalkeeper of the Year. He was also awarded the Mariners Medal for club player of the season, and named in the PFA's A-League Team of the Season. He was also awarded the Harry Kewell Medal for the outstanding Australian under-23-year-old player in June 2012.

Ryan was again central to the Mariners' 2012–13 A-League season. In November 2012, he was again awarded FFA Male U20 Player of the Year. On 2 March 2012, Ryan took a penalty in a match against Western Sydney Wanderers which was saved by Ante Covic; the Wanderers won the match 1–0 to move above the Mariners on the A-League table. Coach Graham Arnold revealed after the game that Ryan had been practicing penalty-taking in the lead-up to that match following a number of missed penalties from other players in the side. The Mariners were victorious in the 2013 A-League Grand Final over the Wanderers, their first win in their four A-League Grand Finals played, with Ryan dedicating the win to the three previous Mariners teams to have lost at that stage.

It was confirmed on 30 May 2013 that Ryan had completed a move to Belgian Pro League side Club Brugge for an undisclosed fee, despite his contract at Central Coast Mariners expiring the following day. On 27 July 2013 Ryan made his debut for Brugge in the first game of the season at home to Sporting Charleroi and kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. In a match against K.A.A. Gent on 23 December 2013 Ryan saved a penalty in the 67th minute that would have resulted in game being level at 2–2. Brugge went on to win the game 3–1 and reports after the match confirmed that Ryan had been offered a new lucrative deal with the club involving a substantial pay increase and contract extension. On 26 November 2014, it was announced that Ryan had agreed to terms with Club Brugge, to extend his contract until 2018. After a string of fantastic performances, it was reported that European giants Liverpool had sent scouts to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup to watch the goalkeeper.

On 21 July 2015, Ryan signed a six-year deal with La Liga side Valencia CF. He was expected to assume the starting goalkeeper role, at least in the medium term, with regular starter Diego Alves out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. He made his unofficial debut in a friendly against PSV Eindhoven on 25 July 2015. On 22 August 2015, Ryan made his La Liga debut in Valencia's opening game of the season, keeping a clean sheet in a scoreless draw with Rayo Vallecano. His run in the starting side extended until September, when he sustained a meniscus tear in a draw with Deportivo La Coruña, forcing him to have surgery and miss over a month of football. A series of good performances from his replacement, Jaume Domènech, led to suggestions that Ryan would not return to the starting side after his return from injury. Indeed, it was not until late November that Ryan was re-promoted to the starting side for a game against Sevilla. Ryan continued to be rotated with Jaume and the returning Alves for the remainder of the season, eventually making 21 appearances for Valencia in all competitions.

Ryan was back in Valencia's starting lineup for the opening matches of the 2016–17 La Liga, with Alves rumored to be seeking an overseas move. However, Alves stayed at Valencia and Ryan subsequently lost his starting position. By January 2017, a number of clubs were interested in Ryan.

On 30 January 2017, Ryan returned to Belgium after he was loaned to Racing Genk. He entered the starting squad straight away, playing his first match in a 1–0 loss to Oostende in the Belgian Cup on 31 January 2017. Ryan stated in April 2017 that he was not planning to stay in Belgium after the season and would instead return to Valencia. Ryan played a number of games for Genk in multiple competitions, with the side reaching the quarterfinals of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, and the final of the Belgian Europa League playoff.

On 16 June 2017, it was announced that Ryan would sign for newly-promoted Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 July 2017 on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He cited the prospect of playing in the Premier League as a main reason for the transfer. Ryan made his debut for Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 August 2017 against Manchester City.

Despite not having featured for the side previously, Ryan's strong form in the 2010–11 A-League led to suggestions he would be called up for the Australian under-20 team for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup in mid-2011. However, he missed the tournament after suffering a serious knee injury.

Ryan was first called up for the Australian under-23 side in November 2011. He made his debut for the side in a scoreless draw with Iraq on 22 November 2011. The Olyroos failed to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Ryan received his first call-up to the Socceroos squad for a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Saudi Arabia in February 2012. Later that year, he was selected in the squad for the second preliminary round of the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup. He made his senior international debut in a 1–1 draw with North Korea on 5 December 2012.

In November 2013, longtime Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer announced his international retirement following the appointment of new coach Ange Postecoglou, leaving Ryan as one of the contenders to be the new first-choice keeper. Postecoglou identified Ryan and fellow young keeper Mitch Langerak as two of the main candidates for the role.

Ryan was selected in May 2014 in the Australian squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He played in all three of Australia's games as they were eliminated in the group stage after losses to the Netherlands, Chile and Spain. Ryan's own performances in the tournament were mixed, and he described the matches as a "massive learning curve" for himself.

Months later, Ryan was selected for the Australian 2015 AFC Asian Cup squad, to be played in Australia in early 2015. He put in a number of strong performances throughout the tournament as Australia conceded just two goals in reaching the Final against South Korea. Australia claimed their first AFC Asian Cup title after winning 2–1 in extra time. Ryan was named the official Best Goalkeeper for the tournament.

In May 2018 he was named in Australia's 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Gaëtan Bong

Thomas Gaëtan Bong (born 25 April 1988) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a defender for English club Brighton & Hove Albion and the Cameroon national team. He previously played club football for Metz, Tours, Valenciennes, Olympiacos and Wigan Athletic and represented France at under-21 level before switching to his native Cameroon.

Born in Cameroon, Bong grew up in France.

Bong began his career in the youth side for Metz and was loaned out for the 2008–09 season to Ligue 2 club Tours. On 29 July 2009, the 21-year-old left Metz to sign a four-year deal with Valenciennes for £595,000, where he made 117 overall appearances for the club and scored 4 goals.

On 19 of August 2013 he signed a contract with Olympiacos for £850,000, where he played 19 games and scored 1 goal against Asteras Tripoli in the Greek Cup. Bong helped Olympiacos win their 41st Superleague Greece title this season. 
Bong also made 4 appearances in the UEFA Champions League.

On 2 February 2015, Bong signed for English club Wigan Athletic on a short-term contract. He was released at the end of the season following Wigan's relegation from the Championship.

In June 2015, Bong joined EFL Championship side Brighton on a free transfer, signing an initial two-year contract with the south coast club. He appeared regularly for the club until tearing his tendon in October 2015, ruling him out for 21 games throughout the season. He would only appear as a substitute for the rest of the season, making three appearances. He also played in the playoffs, as the club lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-finals 3–1 on aggregate.

In the 2016–17 season, Bong was again a regular for the first half of the year, however due to persistent injuries he was not included in the squad for much of the second half apart from three games: a victory against Birmingham City, another against Wigan, and a loss to Bristol City. Brighton finished the season as runners up to Newcastle United, gaining automatic promotion to the Premier League.

Bong's contract was due to expire at the end of the season, however he signed a new one-year contract with the club as Brighton aim to survive their first Premier League season.

Bong played two matches for Brighton in the EFL Cup, the second a 1–0 away defeat against A.F.C. Bournemouth. He made his Premier League debut in a 2–0 away defeat against Arsenal on 1 October 2017. He started for Albion in their next five league games as they embarked on an unbeaten run that saw the club reach as high as 8th place in the Premier League.

On 25 November, Bong was involved in an incident with Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku in Brighton's 1–0 league defeat at Old Trafford, where Lukaku attempted to kick Bong twice in Brighton's penalty area. Lukaku ultimately did not face retrospective action for the incident, with referee Neil Swarbrick's report confirming that he had not seen the incident, but the FA panel could not reach a unanimous verdict.

Bong accused Jay Rodriguez of making a racist remark during a 2–0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on 13 January 2018. The West Brom forward was charged by the Football Association on 8 February in relation to the incident. The charges were later found not proven by the F.A. due to lack of evidence, but the FA was "completely satisfied" Bong's complaint was "made in absolute good faith" and "there has been no suggestion that this was a malicious or fabricated complaint".

On 28 February, Bong signed a one-year contract extension, committing him to Brighton until 30 June 2019.

Bong was eligible to play for either France, where he grew up, or Cameroon, where he was born. He played one international match for the France U21, before opting to play for Cameroon.

Bong played one match for Cameroon in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Cameroon's last group match against the Netherlands, where Cameroon lost 2–1. Cameroon lost all three group games, finishing bottom of Group E of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Shane Duffy

Shane Patrick Michael Duffy (born 1 January 1992) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion and the Republic of Ireland national team.

He came through the youth academy at Everton, where he completed his development after being promoted into the senior squad, spending most of his time at the club out on loan. He joined Blackburn Rovers in 2014 for an undisclosed fee, spending two years with the Lancashire club before moving to Brighton in 2016, where he earned promotion to the Premier League.

Born in Derry in Northern Ireland, Duffy played for Northern Ireland at youth international level before switching allegiance to the Republic of Ireland. He made his debut for their senior team in 2014 and represented the country at UEFA Euro 2016.

As a youth, Duffy played Gaelic football for Doire Colmcille CLG and association football for Foyle Harps, both based in Derry. He represented Northern Ireland at under 16 level in the 2007 Victory Shield tournament and impressed Everton manager David Moyes in a performance at Bloomfield Road against England.

Duffy joined Everton in November 2008 as a first-year scholar and worked his way through the U-18 and reserve teams. Manager David Moyes named him and several young players in the first team for the pre-season friendlies and Duffy scored his first Everton goal against Rochdale in a 4–0 victory. He made his professional debut versus AEK Athens in the UEFA Europa League in December 2009, coming on for the injured Sylvain Distin. In Everton's next European fixture, Duffy made his home debut at Goodison Park, completing the full 90 minutes against BATE Borisov.

In May 2010 Duffy got seriously injured after colliding with a goalkeeper during a training match. He had undergone emergency surgery after lacerating his liver, and losing over 3 litres of blood in what medical staff described as 'freak accident'.

Duffy joined Burnley on loan on 24 March 2011 on an initial 28-day loan with the possibility of an extension until the end of the 2010–11 season. Duffy made his debut for Burnley on 2 April 2011 in the 2–1 defeat to Ipswich Town, playing the full 90 minutes.

Duffy joined Scunthorpe on loan on 1 September 2011. He made his debut on 10 September against Sheffield United, winning the Man of the Match award. He made a total of 19 appearances for the Iron before his parent club recalled him on 5 January 2012, due to an injury to Phil Jagielka, Everton's regular centre-back.

Duffy made his Premier League debut at White Hart Lane on 11 January 2012, coming on as a substitute for the final 30 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. With Everton's regular centre-backs, Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka, injured for the next game three days later, Duffy made the first Premier League start of his career in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa.

On 26 September 2013, Duffy joined Championship club Yeovil Town on an initial month loan. Duffy's loan was eventually extended for a further two months and he made a total of 14 appearances for Yeovil before returning to Everton on 27 December 2013. Duffy rejoined Yeovil on 1 January 2014 when the transfer window re-opened, joining on loan until the end of the season.

On 1 September 2014, Duffy joined Blackburn Rovers, on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Duffy lost out to Sam Byram after making it to the final 3-man shortlist for the December 2015 Championship Player of the Month.

In August 2016, during a league match against Cardiff City, Duffy scored 2 own goals and was later sent off in the final minutes of the game.

On 26 August, Duffy signed a four-year deal with Brighton & Hove Albion for an undisclosed fee. Earlier the same day, it had been reported by "The Mirror" that the transfer cost the "Seagulls" a club record fee of £4 million, after turning down an extension to his contract at Blackburn Rovers. Duffy was an ever-present in Brighton's backline in his first season at the club, helping them gain promotion to the Premier League in 2016–17 by making over 30 league appearances for the club. In the summer following Brighton's promotion, Duffy signed a new contract with the club, extending his stay on the south coast to June 2021.

Duffy was part of the Northern Ireland youth set-up from the U16 level upward. An U17 regular, he was in the squad for their unsuccessful 2009 European Championship qualifying campaign and scored the only goal of the match, a penalty, in the opening game against Liechtenstein.

Aged 17, he was called up to the senior team in June 2009 for a friendly against Italy but was an unused substitute. In August 2009, he made his Northern Ireland U21 debut, playing the whole match and scoring in the 2–1 away loss to Portugal.

Duffy played several games in the 2010 UEFA Under-19 Championship qualifiers, scoring twice in a 4–0 victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland's first win of the qualifying campaign.

Duffy opted to play for the Republic of Ireland, for which he was eligible through his Irish nationality. Following a discussion with former international Liam Brady, Duffy was called up to the Republic of Ireland training camp in May 2010. Everton formally informed the IFA of Duffy's change in allegiance, and the player was called up for a training camp squad for the Republic of Ireland squad to take place in May 2010. At the camp Duffy suffered a 'freak' injury, during a match between the Republic of Ireland development squad and the Ireland amateur side, when he collided with goalkeeper Adrian Walsh and had to undergo life saving surgery at the Mater Hospital after damaging his liver and was discharged six days later after making a full recovery. Although it was expected to take a number of months for him to recuperate and regain his fitness, Duffy returned to action in little over ten weeks after his injury and has since appeared for Republic of Ireland under-19 and under-21 squads. He was called up for the U21 friendly versus Portugal in March 2011.

Players such as Duffy, James McClean, Daniel Kearns, Darron Gibson and Marc Wilson had represented Northern Ireland at youth level but later opted to play for Republic of Ireland. The IFA disputed the players' right to do so under FIFA rules and felt the current rules were a "clear disadvantage over all other 206 Associations". The Irish Football Association took a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the hope of getting FIFA to 'uphold' the rules. Although Duffy's name is often linked with this dispute and the IFA appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, his situation differs from that of players such as Darron Gibson because of his close family ties to Donegal. This means he would have been eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland wherever he was born.

On 13 February 2012, less than two years after sustaining a life-threatening injury, Duffy received a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad, replacing the injured Richard Dunne. On 1 November 2012, Duffy was named in the provisional 26-man Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly fixture against Greece on 14 November 2012. Duffy received his next call-up on 9 May 2014 when he was included in the 32-man provisional squad ahead of friendlies against Turkey, Italy, Costa Rica and Portugal.

Duffy had his international debut in June 2014 lining up against Costa Rica in a friendly in Philadelphia. Two years later, he made his second appearance for Ireland against Switzerland, winning the Man of the Match award, setting up Ciaran Clark for the only goal of the game.

He was called up for Euro 2016, but was an unused sub for the first two matches against Sweden and Belgium. In the final group game of the tournament Duffy came into the team and a heroic performance helped secure an historic victory against Italy to propel the Republic of Ireland into the last sixteen. He was sent off for a professional foul on Antoine Griezmann as the Republic of Ireland were knocked out Euro 2016, losing 2–1 to France.

Dunk was born in Brighton, East Sussex. He is the son of former Sussex non-league player Mark Dunk.

On 30 April 2010, Dunk signed a two-year professional contract with Brighton & Hove Albion following impressive performances captaining the club's youth team. The following day, Dunk made his first professional appearance starting in the 0–0 draw at Milton Keynes Dons.

On 31 January 2011, Dunk signed a one-year extension on his contract keeping him at the club until the summer of 2013. Dunk made eight appearances in the 2010–11 season as Brighton gained promotion to the Championship as League One champions.

On 4 October 2013, Dunk joined League One club Bristol City on a one-month loan deal, to gain some first-team football. He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 away defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 8 October 2013, in the EFL Trophy.

On 25 July 2014, Dunk signed a new four-year contract with Brighton, which kept him at the club until the end of the 2017–18 season. He scored his first goal for Brighton in the club's first game of the 2014–15 season, a 2–0 win over Cheltenham Town in the EFL Cup, in a game that marked new boss Sami Hyypiä's first win at the club.

Dunk formed a partnership at centre back with new Brighton signing Shane Duffy in the 2016–17 season, with the club conceding a joint-league best of 40 goals for the season, in which Brighton were promoted to the Premier League.

Dunk played the full 90 minutes, and scored an own goal, in Brighton's first ever Premier League match, a 0–2 home defeat to Manchester City. On 24 February 2018, Dunk scored his fourth own goal of the season in a 4–1 home win over Swansea City, which brought him level with Martin Škrtel at the top of the list of most own goals in a season in the Premier League.

Dunk played in every game in Brighton's debut season in the Premier League, as the club finished in 15th place and amassed 40 points.

On 5 October 2018, Dunk, alongside centre back partner Shane Duffy, signed a new contract with Brighton, with the pair signing five-year contracts that extended their stay at the club until June 2023.

Dunk received a call-up to the England under-21 squad ahead of their European Championship qualifiers against Iceland and Belgium in November 2011, but did not take the field in either match.

In October 2018, he was called up to replace the injured James Tarkowski in the senior England squad for matches against Croatia and Spain in the Nations League. However, he did not make an appearance. In the next month Dunk was called up again for a friendly against United States and a Nation's League game against Croatia. He made his debut on 15 November playing in the whole match in England's 3–0 win over the United States at Wembley Stadium.

Beram Kayal

Beram Kayal (or Biram Keyal, , ; born 2 May 1988) is an Arab-Israeli professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Brighton & Hove Albion and the Israel national team. He has been a full international since 2008, and has 40 senior caps to date. 

Kayal joined Maccabi Haifa in 2002 and made his professional debut in 2006 at the age of 18. He made 125 appearances and scored eight goals before moving to Celtic in 2010. He has received plaudits from many Scottish football pundits and was named the SPL player of the month for January 2011. In January 2015, he joined Brighton.

Kayal started his career as a striker in the various Youth teams of Maccabi Haifa and scored many goals before taking on the role of a midfielder. Despite only being 16 years old at the time, he moved up to the Maccabi Haifa under-19 team for the 2004–05 campaign and excelled as part of the team that won a League and Cup double. Kayal was named the League's Outstanding Player.

He made his first-team debut for Maccabi Haifa at the end of the 2005–06 season in a 2–1 win over Maccabi Petah Tikva which sealed Maccabi's third League title in a row at the age of 17 making two appearances that season. In the 2006–07 season, he made six appearances in all competitions, but took on the role of captain of the under-19 team that won another League and Cup double. He scored a hat-trick in a league win against Beitar Jerusalem.

In the 2007–08 season Kayal became a first team regular featuring 36 times in the first-team. After that he became an integral part of the team and enjoyed success in subsequent seasons winning the Premier League and Toto Cup.

During the 2007 Torneo di Viareggio youth tournament in Italy, Kayal was praised by the Italian press for a Man of the match performance against their counterparts from Fiorentina. Both "Corriere della Sera" and "Gazzetta dello Sport" seemed to be astonished to learn that he was an Arab on an Israeli team and took a great amount of time to learn more about him.

On 29 July 2010, Kayal signed a four-year deal with Scottish Premier League side Celtic and was given the number 33 shirt.

Kayal made his debut for Celtic against FC Utrecht on 19 August 2010 and showed his full potential by getting off to the best possible start, setting up the opening goal of the game for Efraín Juárez and winning the Man of the Match award. In September 2010 he suffered a setback and was out of action for three months due to a hernia injury which required surgery. He made his return as a substitute on 26 December against St Johnstone, and was restored to the starting line-up in a 2–0 win over Rangers at Ibrox on 2 January 2011.

His performances won him the SPL Player of the Month award for January 2011, and the praise of Celtic manager Neil Lennon. His determination and competitive attitude played a key part in his side's success in his first season in Scottish football. On 9 April 2011, Kayal captained the side in a 1–0 win over St Mirren. He scored his first goal for Celtic in a 1–0 SPL win over St Johnstone on 12 April 2011. His first home goal was a long range effort against Dundee United on 1 May 2011. On 4 May, Kayal had to be taken off in the second half of an SPL match against Inverness Caledonian Thistle because of suspected concussion after a collision with Ross Tokely. Kayal sustained a fractured wrist in the same incident and subsequently missed the rest of the 2010–11 season.

Kayal captained Celtic for the second time on 10 September 2011, against Motherwell in the SPL, leading the team to a 4–0 victory at Celtic Park. He was made captain while Scott Brown was out with an ankle injury.

Kayal suffered ankle ligament damage against Rangers on 28 December 2011 after a tackle by Lee McCulloch and was stretchered off with 13 minutes to play. Celtic won the match 1–0 which sent them top of the SPL table. The injury put Kayal out of action for over four months and he returned to the side only in the last game of the season, a 5–0 win over Hearts. Later, Kayal accused McCulloch of deliberately injuring him that he "have not forgotten that for a moment."

In the 2012 season, Kayal obtained European nationality and played an important role for the team during the Scottish League.
On 22 October 2013 he scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League against AFC Ajax in a 2–1 win.

On 23 January 2015, Kayal signed for Brighton & Hove Albion on a two-and-a-half-year deal, for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 7 February, scoring a consolation goal for Brighton in a 2–3 defeat at home against Nottingham Forest. On 18 August, he scored within 14 seconds away to Huddersfield Town, albeit in a 1–1 draw. Brighton narrowly missed out on automatic promotion where Kayal played 43 games and scoring 2 goals in the league in the 2015-16 season. Brighton were to face another season in the Championship after losing to Sheffield Wednesday on aggregate in the play offs where Kayal played in both matches for the Albion.

On 7 January 2017 Kayal played in his first ever FA Cup match where he scored in the 2-0 home win over MK Dons. On 17 April 2017 Kayal played in the 2-1 home win over Wigan Athletic which secured automatic promotion to the Premier League.

Kayal broke his leg in pre season in a friendly match against Atlético Madrid where he was sidelined for 10 weeks. Kayal made his Premier League debut on 13 December 2017 in a 2-0 away defeat to Spurs. Kayal went on to make 18 more Premier League appearances and played in the 1-0 win over Manchester Utd which secured Albion's Premier League status.

Kayal signed a one year contract extension on 28 September 2018 that keeps him at the Sussex club until June 2020. Kayal scored his first ever Premier League goal in a 1-0 away win against Newcastle on 20 October 2018.

Raised in Spain, he began playing in the country's lower divisions before making his professional debut for Córdoba at the age of 21. In 2016, he joined Deportivo La Coruña, and two years later he signed for Brighton & Hove Albion of the Premier League.

Andone earned his first full cap for Romania in June 2015 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016.

Born in Botoșani, Andone moved to Vinaròs in the Valencian Community in 2005, aged 12, to join his mother after his father died in a car accident. He immediately joined Vinaròs CF's youth setup, and in 2008 moved to Castellón.

Andone made his senior debut on 16 January 2011, coming on as a late substitute for Pau Franch in a 1–1 away draw against Orihuela for the Segunda División B championship. He appeared in three further matches for the club, which eventually suffered relegation.

On 2 June 2011, Andone joined Villarreal, returning to youth football. He also appeared with the C-team during the campaign, with the side in Tercera División.

On 15 August 2013, Andone was loaned to the third level's Atlético Baleares, in a season-long deal. He finished the campaign with 12 goals in 34 matches, with the Balearic outfit being one point shy of the play-offs.

On 3 July 2014, Andone signed a three-year deal with Córdoba, being initially assigned to the reserves in the same division. On 29 November, he was promoted to the main squad by manager Miroslav Đukić.

Andone played his first match as a professional on 3 December 2014, replacing Xisco in the 57th minute of a 0–1 away loss against Granada, for the season's Copa del Rey. He scored his first goal on the second leg, netting his side's only in a 1–1 home draw.

On 16 January, in a 1–1 home draw against Eibar, he scored the first after only ten seconds, being the Andalusians' fastest goal in the top level, and the fourth overall.

Following Córdoba's relegation, he was named the Segunda División Player of the Month for October 2015 with four goals, which put his team in the top position.

In January 2016, as Sevilla, Málaga, Southampton, Aston Villa and Steaua București showed interest in Andone, he renewed his contract with the "Blanquiverdes" until 2018, receiving a wage per year 10 times higher (and 20 if his club earn promotion), and with a release clause of €20 million, the highest such figure in the club's history.

In August 2017, Deportivo La Coruña turned down a €13 million offer for the player from Premier League side Burnley, with club president Tino Fernández stating that Andone would only leave if his €30 million release clause is activated. Brighton & Hove Albion was also interested in transferring him, and made a €20 million bid which was also supposedly rejected. He scored six goals and assisted three more in the 2017–18 season, which ended in relegation for the Galician team.

On 25 May 2018, Andone signed a five-year deal with Brighton & Hove Albion for an undisclosed transfer fee, and joined the Premier League side when the international transfer window opened on 8 June. The fee was rumoured as being €6 million, representing the release clause in his contract in case of Deportivo La Coruña's relegation.

Andone scored for Brighton in his first start (4th appearance) away against Huddersfield Town to flip the game from 1–0 down to 2–1 up, and netted again in the next game at the Falmer Stadium against rivals Crystal Palace, collecting the ball just inside the Palace half, dribbling into the area and scoring from an acute angle. 

On 5 January 2019, Andone scored on his FA Cup debut in a 3–1 away win against Bournemouth, and a month later he scored in a fourth round replay win against West Bromwich Albion. Before his goal, he elbowed opponent Sam Field's face without the officials seeing; he was later fined and banned for three matches.

Andone stated that his dream is to play for the Romania national team, despite living in Spain for most of his life. He was called up by manager Anghel Iordănescu for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualification match against the Faroe Islands in March 2015, but was an unused substitute in the 1–0 win. Andone made his full international debut in another qualifier on 13 June 2015, playing the last 18 minutes in a 0–0 away draw against Northern Ireland.

On 17 November 2015, Andone scored his first international goal, exploiting an error by Italian goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu for a last-minute equaliser in a 2–2 draw in Bologna. He was selected for UEFA Euro 2016 in France, where he started against the hosts in the opening game after recovering from a hand injury, and made two more substitute appearances in a group-stage exit.

Naturally right-footed, Andone plays as a striker and has been praised for his work ethic.

Murray's season ended on 24 April 2010 with Brighton's 2–1 win over Bristol Rovers to stay in the division; he was sent off ten minutes after coming on as a substitute for Chris Holroyd.

The 2010–11 season proved to be Murray's best season thus far at Brighton, scoring 22 goals and finishing runner-up to Craig Mackail-Smith as League One top scorer. This included a hat-trick on 1 January 2011 in a 5–0 win over Leyton Orient.

On 31 January 2017, Murray re-signed permanently for Brighton & Hove Albion on a deal until June 2019. He had scored 15 goals in 28 appearances while on loan to the club in the first half of the season. He contributed 8 more league goals in the remainder of the season, including the opening goal in a 2–1 home win against Wigan Athletic on 17 April that sealed Brighton's promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history.

Newly promoted Brighton made a positive start to their inaugural Premier League season, sitting in 8th place after eleven games. An unbeaten run of four games from mid-October coincided with Murray hitting a good run of form, with the striker scoring four goals in the three games preceding the November international break. His scoring run began with two against West Ham United in a 3–0 away win, and he followed it up with goals against Southampton at home and Swansea City away, earning Brighton four points. On 8 January 2018, Murray scored the winning goal in Brighton's 2–1 victory over arch rivals and former club Crystal Palace to eliminate them from the FA Cup at the third-round stage.

On 1 September 2018 Murray scored twice to take Brighton from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with Fulham.

Solly March

Solomon Benjamin March (born 20 July 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Brighton & Hove Albion.

March was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex. His father, Steve, had been an apprentice footballer at Brighton & Hove Albion in the late 1980s. March attended secondary school at Ringmer Community College and St Bede's School, Hailsham. Between 2008 and 2012 March played cricket for Hellingly C.C.

March played at Crystal Palace between the ages of 11 and 13 and then switched from Eastbourne Borough to fellow East Sussex club Lewes as a youth player. Lewes were playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division, and the 17-year-old March made his first-team debut on 10 September 2011, coming on in the 86th minute as a substitute against Aveley, when he was offered a scholarship by Brighton & Hove Albion.

March signed a three-year contract with Brighton in December 2011. At the time of his transfer it was reported by the Brighton Argus that March had also been offered a contract with Millwall and a trial with Newcastle United. Lewes manager Steve King suggested that March had been attracted to Brighton because of the style of football they were playing under manager Gus Poyet and because the move to another East Sussex club would allow him to remain close to his family.

While progressing through Brighton's youth squad, March quickly made an impact for the side and scored a hat–trick, in a 3–1 win over Stevenage's youth squad on 18 February 2012. While still a member of Brighton's development squad, 2013 saw the beginning of March's senior career. During the last half of the 2012–13 season, March made the bench for three senior Championship games but did not make an appearance. March impressed in Brighton's youth squad, earning himself the team's Young Player of the Year Award 2013 and a contract extension until 2015.

He then performed well in pre-season friendlies with the first team prior to the start of the 2013–14 season; highlighted with a 'superb' goal against Norwich City. March was a named substitute in five of the first six games in the 2013–14 season and was substituted on in the 85th and 91st minutes against Derby County and Burnley respectively, thus creating his debut in Brighton's first team. Around November, March's first team opportunities became limited, leading to rumours that he's expected to be loaned out. However, the move never happened and he stayed at the club. Despite this, March scored his first senior goal for the Albion in an FA Cup fourth round tie at Port Vale on 25 January 2014. The game also saw Rohan Ince and Jon Obika score their first goals for the club in a 3–1 win. For the rest of the season, March was given a handful of first team opportunities, resulting him making 28 appearances in all competitions. Because of this, March signed a new four-year deal with the "Seagulls" in April 2014.

To begin the 2014–15 season, March worked on improving his match fitness. However, his progress stalled as he suffered a lower back problem that would rule him out for several months. After returning to training from injury, March made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a second half substitute, in a 2–1 loss against Fulham on 29 November 2014. In the club's second meeting against Fulham thirty days later, on 29 December 2014, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win. This was followed up by setting up a goal for Rohan Ince, who scored the only goal of the game, in a win over Charlton Athletic. March went on to have a handful of first team appearances until February when he suffered a calf injury during a 3–2 loss against Nottingham Forest on 7 February 2015, in what turns out to be his last appearance of the season. Initially out for weeks, March was eventually for the rest of the season. Despite this, he went on to make 13 appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

In the 2015–16 season, March returned to the first team from injury and started the season well when he set up a goal for Kazenga LuaLua, in a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest. Since returning from injury, March regained his first team place at the club, mostly in the right–midfield position. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–1 win over Leeds United on 17 October 2015. He went on to score two goals later in the season against MK Dons and Birmingham City. His performance throughout November earned him a nomination for November's Player of the Month but lost out to Daryl Murphy. However, on 12 December 2015, March suffered a season ending knee injury during a 2–2 draw against Derby County. Despite this, March made 17 appearances and scored three times for Brighton in the 2015–16 season.

At the beginning of the 2016–17 season, March remained sidelined out of the first team since returning from a knee injury. He returned to action from injury in a reserve match against Aston Villa’s U23 side on 22 August 2016. After playing in the reserve side for the first few months since returning from injury, March signed a contract extension with Brighton, keeping him at the club until 2020. March made his return to the first team on 5 November 2016, coming on as a second–half substitute in a 2–0 win over Bristol City. March then scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–3 draw against Brentford on 5 February 2017. This was followed up by setting up two goals in a 4–1 win over Burton Albion. March went on to score two more goals throughout the season, against Rotherham United and Wigan Athletic, with the Wigan goal on 17 April 2017 being the decider in Brighton's promotion. Since returning to the first team from injury, March began to regained his first team in the midfield position and played a key role in the side gaining promotion to the Premier League. At the end of the 2016–17 season, March went on to make 24 appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.

In the 2017–18 season, March made his Premier League debut, where he started and played for 75 minutes before being substituted, in a 2–0 loss against Manchester City. March scored his first Premier League goal for Brighton on 15 September 2017, the opening goal in a 2–1 away defeat to AFC Bournemouth.

On 16 December 2018 March scored his 10th goal for the Albion in a 2−1 home defeat to Chelsea in which was his first Premier League goal at The Amex. On 17 March 2019, Jurgen Locadia scored in the FA Cup quarter final away against Millwall. His goal gave Brighton a lifeline putting them just a goal behind at The Den. A few minutes later March scored a last gasp free kick making it 2–2 and to take it to extra time. The game stayed level throughout extra time and Brighton went to win on penalties 5–4 (in which Locadia and March both scored in) to take them to Wembley.

March was named by Gareth Southgate as a forward in the England Under-21 squad in May 2014. The squad will play a Euro U-21s qualification match against Wales and at least four games at the Toulon Tournament. March had not previously played for England at any level. After appearing as an unused substitute against Wales U21 on 19 May 2014, Solly made his England under-21 debut against Qatar U20 on 22 May 2014. On 27 March 2017, March scored his first international goal in a U21 friendly against Denmark U21 with a strike from outside the box.

March typically plays on the wing either in midfield or as part of a forward line. Steve King, his former manager at Lewes, described March as a "technically very good" player who "has bags of energy, is a box-to-box player, has a good left foot, a good shot, he sees things early and the weight of his passes is very good."

In May 2017, following Brighton & Hove Albion's promotion to the Premier League, March became engaged to girlfriend Amelia Goldman after proposing to her in Dubai.

Martín Montoya

Martín Montoya Torralbo (born 14 April 1991) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right back for Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion.

He started playing with Barcelona, going on to appear in 67 competitive games during five La Liga seasons and win seven major titles (two goals scored). In the competition he also represented Betis and Valencia, totalling 112 matches and three goals all clubs combined.

Born in Gavà, Barcelona, Catalonia, Montoya started playing football for hometown club CF Gavà, moving to FC Barcelona's youth system, "La Masia", at the age of 8. After progressing through its ranks, he was promoted to the B-team in 2009.

In the 2009–10 season, Montoya contributed with 22 games as the Luis Enrique-led side returned to the second division after an 11-year absence. On 26 February 2011 he made his debut for the main squad, coming on as a substitute for Adriano in the last five minutes of a 3–0 away win against RCD Mallorca.

Towards the end of March 2011, rumours surfaced linking Montoya with Valencia CF, who was willing to pay the €3 million buy-out clause of the player. On 30 April, he made his first start for Barcelona in a 1–2 La Liga loss at Real Sociedad, suffering a broken clavicle in the early minutes of the match and being sidelined for the rest of the campaign.

Montoya again spent the vast majority of 2011–12 with the reserves. His first start for the first team occurred on 12 January 2012, in a 2–1 away triumph against CA Osasuna for the Copa del Rey (6–1 on aggregate). Due to injury to Dani Alves he played in the final of the domestic cup, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 win over Athletic Bilbao; he had previously scored his first official goal on 6 December 2011, helping the hosts defeat FC BATE Borisov 4–0 in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.

Montoya scored his second goal as a professional on 1 June 2013, netting the third in a 4–1 home win against Málaga CF. He finished the season with 24 appearances all competitions comprised, totalling 1,678 minutes of action.

Montoya expressed his desire to leave the Camp Nou in December 2014, after the signing of another player for his position, also Brazilian Douglas. He eventually stayed until the end of the campaign, which ended in treble conquest, his only major contribution being playing 80 minutes in a 3–1 success at Paris Saint-Germain F.C. for the Champions League quarter-finals.

In July 2015, Montoya joined Inter Milan on a season-long loan for €1.3 million, with the option of extending the deal for another year pending appearances. The Italian club also had an obligation to buy him for €6 million, if he played 33% of all competitive matches during his tenure and each appearance amounted to at least 30 minutes.

On 1 February 2016, still owned by Barcelona, Montoya signed with Real Betis until 30 June.

On 1 August 2016, Montoya signed a four-year deal with Valencia following the expiration of his contract with Barcelona. He played 29 matches and scored twice in his first season, with his team finally ranking in 12th place.

On 9 August 2018, Montoya signed with English club Brighton & Hove Albion for €7 million, subject to international clearance. He made his debut in the Premier League ten days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–2 home win against Manchester United.

In 2011, Montoya earned his first cap with the Spanish under-21 team. He was picked by manager Luis Milla to the squad that competed in that year's UEFA European Championship, and started in all the games as the national side won the tournament in Denmark.

On 25 August 2011, Montoya was selected for the first time to the full side by coach Vicente del Bosque, for games against Chile and Liechtenstein. However, he did not take the field on either match.

David Button

David Robert Edmund Button (born 27 February 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Brighton & Hove Albion.

A product of the Tottenham Hotspur academy, Button came to prominence at Brentford in 2013. He earned 31 caps for England from U16 to U20 level.

Growing up in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Button joined hometown club Stevenage Borough at a young age and attended the club's Centre of Excellence.

Button joined Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur's youth academy in 2003 and signed a scholarship deal in July 2005. After completing his scholarship, he signed his first professional contract on 28 December 2007, running until the summer of 2011. An injury to second-choice goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes saw Button receive his first call-up to senior team substitutes' bench early in the 2009–10 season for a 2–1 Premier League win over West Ham United on 23 August 2009. Button made his debut in the following game, replacing Carlo Cudicini after 81 minutes of a 5–1 League Cup victory over Championship side Doncaster Rovers. He was an unused substitute on a further two occasions during the 2009–10 season and signed a new contract after the season, running until 2013. Button spent most of his time as a Tottenham player on loan to other clubs and proclaimed himself a "journeyman", having played for 12 different clubs by the age of 23. In August 2012, despite having not been called into the first team squad in nearly three years,Tottenham goalkeeping coach Tony Parks said he held Button in "high regard" and that Button was a late developer in terms of increasing his strength. Button departed Tottenham in late August 2012, having just played eight minutes in one first team appearance for the club.

Button moved on loan to Conference Premier side Grays Athletic on a one-month loan on 10 January 2008. He made three appearances during his spell. Button returned to Tottenham on 10 February and moved to League Two side Rochdale on a one-month loan on 27 March. He made no appearances for the club and was an unused substitute on seven occasions.

Button rejoined Grays Athletic on a three-month loan on 19 September 2008. He made 17 appearances during his spell and kept four clean sheets. On 16 January 2009 he moved to League Two side Bournemouth on a one-month loan. Button made his Football League debut away at Rotherham United, in a game which the Cherries lost 1–0. He made four appearances for the club and returned to Tottenham on 28 February.<ref name="Games played by David Button in 2008/2009"></ref> Button joined fellow League Two side Luton Town on a one-month loan deal on 6 March, and was an unused substitute on seven occasions. He was on the bench for Luton's 3–2 2009 Football League Trophy Final victory over Scunthorpe United at Wembley Stadium, which was his last involvement for Luton before his return to Tottenham. Button joined League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge on an emergency loan until the end of the 2008–09 season. Button was, unusually for a goalkeeper, handed the squad number 6 and made his debut for the club in the 3–0 home victory against Bradford City on 18 April. He made two more appearances before returning to Tottenham.

Button joined League Two side Crewe Alexandra on a one-month loan on 22 July 2009 and he played in the first three games of the season, keeping two clean sheets. Button was recalled by Tottenham after his loan finished, but he re-joined Crewe on a three-month loan on 1 September. He made his second debut for Crewe 5 September against Macclesfield Town and was credited with an assist for Joel Grant's winning goal in the 2–1 victory. After a further six appearances, Tottenham recalled Button on 27 October. On 20 November 2009, Button joined League Two side Shrewsbury Town on loan until January 2010. His loan was extended by a further month in January and then until the end of the season in February. He had a successful spell, making 26 appearances and keeping 9 clean sheets.

On 3 August 2010, Button joined League One side Plymouth Argyle on a season-long loan. Playing for the first time at League One level, injuries from September though to November disrupted his spell and he was dropped on 22 February 2010 after an eight-game losing run. Button managed to oust Romain Larrieu as number-one and regain his place in early April, though his efforts were in vain as Plymouth finished 23rd and suffered relegation to League Two. Button made 30 appearances during the season.<ref name="Games played by David Button in 2010/2011"></ref>

Button joined League One side Leyton Orient on 26 August 2011, on a loan running until 7 January 2012. He made only two appearances before suffering a shoulder injury which kept him out until Boxing Day. On 1 January 2012, Button left Leyton Orient and joined Championship side Doncaster Rovers on a one-month loan, which was later extended by another month. He made eight appearances during his stint.<ref name="Games played by David Button in 2011/2012"></ref> On 19 March 2012, Button joined fellow Championship side Barnsley on an emergency loan deal, to cover for the injured David Preece. He made 9 appearances.

On 28 August 2012,Tottenham Hotspur reached an agreement with Championship side Charlton Athletic for the permanent transfer of Button for a £500,000 fee. He served as backup to Ben Hamer and had to wait until January 2013 for his debut, in a 1–0 FA Cup third round defeat to Huddersfield Town. Hamer was dropped by manager Chris Powell in March and the first of four consecutive appearances came on 2 March in a 1–0 league defeat at home to Burnley. After Button's fourth appearance against Huddersfield in the league on 9 March, Powell said "David has now got the shirt", but Hamer soon regained his place and Button made only two further appearances. He made just six appearances for Charlton and departed The Valley in July 2013. Button revealed the following year that though Chris Powell wanted him to stay, he had a difficult year with the Addicks and forced his departure from the club.

On 30 July 2013, League One club Brentford signed Button on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. The departure of Simon Moore to Cardiff City and injury to Richard Lee saw Button begin the season as manager Uwe Rösler's first-choice goalkeeper. Button started each of Brentford's opening six league games, but disaster struck on 7 September against Bradford City when with the score at 0–0, Button received a straight red card for a challenge on Bradford player Nahki Wells just outside the penalty box after 26 minutes. During his three-match suspension, Jack Bonham and then the fit-again Richard Lee took over the goalkeeping position. Button made his next appearance in a 1–0 defeat to Rotherham United on 5 October and regained his position as first-choice goalkeeper. An open forum between players and management in the dressing room after a 2–1 defeat to Stevenage on 12 October saw a turnaround in the team's fortunes and the beginning of a run of nine consecutive wins in the league, with Button appearing in eight of those matches and keeping seven clean sheets. With Button as a virtual ever-present, the Bees secured automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1–0 win over Preston North End on 18 April 2014. Button made 45 appearances and kept 20 clean sheets in league matches during the 2013–14 season. He signed a new three-year contract on 27 June 2014, which would keep him at Griffin Park until the end of the 2016–17 season.

With Richard Lee frequently injured, Button was undisputed first choice during the 2014–15 season. His performances against Huddersfield Town and Ipswich Town in March 2015 saw him selected in the Football League Team of the Week. A successful second season at Griffin Park for Button ended after Brentford's 5–1 playoff semi-final aggregate defeat to Middlesbrough. He made 49 appearances, keeping 11 clean sheets in league matches. Button was again first choice during the 2015–16 season, featuring as an ever-present in league matches and talks began over a new contract in May 2016. The talks broke down and he departed Brentford on 19 July 2016, having made 141 appearances during three seasons with the club.

On 19 July 2016, Button joined Championship club Fulham on a three-year contract, with an option for a further year, for an undisclosed fee. He was the first-choice goalkeeper during the 2016–17 season, until he lost his place to Marcus Bettinelli in early April 2017. A 6th-place finish saw the Cottagers qualify for the playoffs, but Button could only look on as an unused substitute during the 2–1 aggregate defeat to Reading in the semi-finals.

Button signed for Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion on 16 July 2018 on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
Button made his debut for the Sussex club in a EFL Cup tie against south coast rivals Southampton on 28 August 2018 where Brighton lost 1-0 at The Amex with Charlie Austin netting the only goal of the game. Button made his Premier League debut on 29 December 2018 in a 1-0 home win against Everton where he made some crucial saves in a good win for the Albion. Button went on to make 3 more Premier League appearances and 1 FA Cup appearance whilst he covered for Maty Ryan who was competing for Australia in the Asian Cup.

Button made regular appearances for England at U16, U17, U19 and U20 level between 2003 and 2009. He appeared in England's group games at the 2005 European U17 Championship and 2008 European U19 Championship, making three appearances in each tournament as England failed to get past the group stage.

Button attended Monk's Walk School in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.

Dan Burn

Daniel Johnson Burn (born 9 May 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Brighton & Hove Albion.

Burn made his debut in the Football League for Darlington in 2009 and joined Fulham at the end of the 2010–11 season, having made 19 appearances for Darlington. He spent the 2012–13 season on loan to Yeovil Town, for whom he made 41 appearances, and spent part of the following season on loan to Birmingham City. He joined Wigan when his contract with Fulham expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. Burn signed for Brighton & Hove Albion ahead of the 2018–19 season, and was loaned back to Wigan until January 2019.

Born in Blyth, Northumberland, Burn grew up supporting Newcastle United and idolised Alan Shearer. Released by Newcastle United at age 11, Burn played youth football for local teams New Hartley, Blyth Town and Blyth Spartans. At age 16, he began working for supermarket Asda, when a scout for Darlington saw him playing for Blyth Spartans and he signed on professional terms on 1 July 2009.

Due to the club's financial problems and lack of available players, Burn was promoted to the first team for the first time and appeared as an unused substitute, in a 3–1 loss against Hereford United on 31 October 2009. Burn then made his away league debut coming on as a 19th-minute substitute for injured defender Mark Bower against Torquay United on 12 December 2009, which resulted in a 5–0 loss. Burn then made his first start in another encounter against Torquay United on 6 March 2010, which saw Darlington lost 3–1. Though he made four appearance in the 2009–10 season, the club, however, were relegated to the Conference.

After this, Burn was sent back to the academy in order to develop more throughout the whole 2010 and soon recalled to the first team once again by Manager Mark Cooper, where he made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season, in a 3–1 win against Barrow on 3 January 2011. Burn was given a handful of first team appearances, where he went on to make ten appearance in the 2010–11 season and his performance was praised by Cooper. Burn finished second behind Jamie Chandler for the club's Young Player of the Year award.

Burn's performance attracted interests from Premier League clubs, including Fulham. Despite the club made an improved contract for Burn, Manager Cooper said it would be unlikely to keep Burn the following season, although he believed that Burn could play in the Premier League.

On 14 April 2011, a deal was agreed for Burn to join Premier League club Fulham at the end of the 2010–11 season for a fee thought to be around £350,000.

After signing for Fulham, Burn was sent to the club's reserve to develop and learn under the club's reserve manager Billy McKinlay.

On 25 September 2012, Burn joined League One club Yeovil Town on a youth loan deal for an initial month. Four days later, he made his debut against Preston North End. Burn scored an own goal for Preston in the 86th minute but then went on to score his first senior goal a minute later. Yeovil lost the match 3–2. Burn managed to established himself in the first team at Yeovil Town and had his loan extension at the club twice: On 23 October, Fulham confirmed that Burn's loan deal with Yeovil had been extended until 20 November 2012 and then extended again until the end of the season. Burn then scored his second goal for Yeovil Town on 2 February 2013, in a 3–0 win over Brentford. Having previously been suspended after being booked five times this season, Burn received a red card after a second bookable offense, in a 2–0 win over Stevenage on 13 April 2013 and missed the last three matches.

After serving three matches, Burn returned to the first team, playing in the first leg of the play-off, in a 1–0 loss against Sheffield United. Burn then helped the club overcome the deficit in the second leg, in a 2–1 win. Burn scored at Wembley Stadium for Yeovil during the 2013 League One play-off Final gaining Yeovil Town promotion to the Championship for the first time in their history. Burn returned to Fulham having made 41 appearances for Yeovil and scored 3 goals.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Burn stated he was keen on returning to Yeovil Town.

On 3 July 2013, Burn signed a new contract with Fulham keeping him at the club until at least 2015 while also moving on a season-long loan to Championship side Birmingham City. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at home to Watford on 3 August 2013, and remained a regular member of the starting eleven. His first goal for the club, a header from a Paul Caddis cross, opened the scoring in the League Cup third-round tie on 25 September, as Birmingham beat holders Swansea City 3–1.

Burn was recalled by Fulham on 2 January 2014. After being recalled, Burn made his first-team debut for Fulham on 4 January 2014, in the FA Cup third round against Norwich City at Carrow Road. Following the Norwich game, Fulham Manager René Meulensteen said that he expected Burn would re-join Birmingham City on loan for the second time, but the move never happened. 

Burn then went on to make his Premier League debut in a 2–0 loss against Arsenal on 18 January 2014. After the match, Burn's performance was praised by Meulensteen. Burn was given a handful of first team appearance until he suffered a muscle injury. After being sidelined for weeks, Burn returned to the first team on 3 May 2014, playing 58 minutes, in a 4–1 loss against Stoke City, which relegated the club to the Championship next season.

In the 2014–15 season, Burn made his first appearance of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Cardiff City on 30 August 2014. He scored his first goal for Fulham in a League Cup tie against Doncaster Rovers on 23 September 2014. On 21 October 2014, Burn captained Fulham for the first time and scored his first league goal of the season, in a 3–3 draw against Rotherham United. However, Burn struggled to regain his first team, where he spent most of the season on the substitute bench. On 27 January 2015, Burn signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2016. Burn later finished the 2014–15 season, making 22 appearance and scoring once in all competitions.

In the 2015–16 season, Burn provided assist for Cauley Woodrow to equalise the last minute goal, in a 1–1 draw against Huddersfield Town on 22 August 2015. After the match, Burn was named the Man of the Match by fans. In a 0–0 draw against Middlesbrough on 17 October 2015, Burn formed a partnership with Richard Stearman and the pair kept a 0–0 and Burn was named Man of the Match ahead of Stearman. Burn soon lost his first team place under the intern-management of Peter Grant, but soon regain his first team place under the management of Stuart Gray and Slaviša Jokanović. Having become a first team regular under Slaviša Jokanović, the club had started a contract talk with Burn. Burn helped the club retained their Championship status next season when they finished 20th place and made thirty–five appearance in all competition.

At the end of the 2015–16 season, Burn was released by the club following his contract came to an end.

Burn signed a three-year contract with newly promoted Championship club Wigan Athletic, to begin when his contract with Fulham expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. He was given squad number 33.

Burn made his Wigan Athletic in the opening game of the season, starting in a 2–1 loss against Bristol City. After a slow start to the season Burn became one of the stand out performers in the team and was recognised in winning the club's Player of the Year award. He scored his first goal for Wigan when he scored in a 1–0 win at former club Birmingham City on 7 March 2017.

Burn signed a four-year contract with Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion on 9 August 2018 for an undisclosed fee. He was loaned back to Wigan Athletic until January 2019.

Burn officially joined up with Brighton on 1 January 2019, after his loan spell at Wigan came to an end. Burn made his debut for the Sussex club on 26 January 2019 in a FA Cup home fixture against West Brom where he won player of the match. The match ended 0-0 taking it to a replay.

Ezequiel Schelotto

Ezequiel Matías Schelotto (; born 23 May 1989) is an Argentine-Italian footballer who plays as a right back for Italian club Chievo Verona, on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion. He is nicknamed "El Galgo" ("The Greyhound" in Spanish) because of his running skills or, less frequently, "El Mosquetero" ("The Musketeer").

Schelotto joined Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Cesena in July 2008. Then, in April 2009, his transfer was finally cleared by FIFA. During that season, following his approved transfer, Schelotto played six matches out of a possible seven for Cesena, scoring one goal and helping Cesena to promotion back up to the second tier Serie B.

In June 2009, Schelotto was signed by Serie A side Atalanta on a co-ownership deal for €250,000 and, in July 2009, he was instantly loaned back to his previous club, Cesena. During the 2009–10 Serie B campaign, Schelotto made 40 league appearances for the side, scoring six goals. Of his 40 matches, 33 of them were from the starting XI. He earned just €82,750 in 2009–10 season.

On 24 June 2010, Schelotto was signed outright by Atalanta for an additional €2.5 million fee, which were just relegated to the Serie B following an 18th-place finish during the 2009–10 Serie A, whilst Cesena earned their second consecutive promotion as the club earned promotion to the top flight following a top three Serie B finish. Following his purchase, the player was again loaned back to the Emilia-Romagna-based club, along with veteran midfielder Fabio Caserta and central defender Maximiliano Pellegrino. Schelotto wage was also increased significantly. As he left the club in January 2011, he earned €268,333.31 from Cesena for the first 7 months of 2010–11 season.

Schelotto had a bitter Serie A season with Cesena, one in which the team started brightly, even topping the league table by round three, but then endured a landslide that saw the team drop to 18th place and into the relegation places by November. He lost his starting place on 24 October as the coach used Luis Jiménez as a new supportive striker in the three forward formation. Since then, he only made four starts to replace Giuseppe Colucci (who was injured) and Stephen Appiah (twice), respectively, as one of the midfielders. His last start — and last match — with Cesena was on 23 January 2011, a match where Cesena fielded an inferior squad against Milan where the three forwards, Schelotto, Igor Budan, and Dominique Malonga, were not regular starters.

During the first half of the 2010–11 campaign, Schelotto made 17 league appearances with one goal. On 31 January 2011, he was transferred to Serie A side Catania on loan.

On 31 January 2011, Schelotto transferred to Catania in Sicily, on loan from Atalanta. In his transfer deal, Catania were sold the option to sign the player on a co-ownership basis at the conclusion of the current campaign. Schelotto started his first match for the Sicilians on 6 February 2011, a match that Catania lost 1–0 away to Bologna, in part due to an early red card by Argentine defender Pablo Álvarez.

Schelotto returned to Atalanta on 1 July 2011. He was included in the first team squad of Atalanta for 2011–12 Serie A campaign, which the club was promoted back to the top tier as the champions of Serie B in May 2011. During his 1½ seasons with the Serie A club, he earned a transfer to F.C. Internazionale Milano for €6 million transfer fee in January 2013, despite in a cash-plus-player deal.

Schelotto joined Italian giants Internazionale on 31 January 2013 for €3.5 million cash plus 50% "card" of Marko Livaja (Inter valued 50% rights of Livaja for €2.5 million but bought the rights back from Cesena for €1.5 million cash). Schelotto made his debut on 3 February in a 3–1 loss against Siena, playing the first 45 minutes before giving way to Mateo Kovačić. He scored his first goal for the club in the 1–1 draw against city rivals Milan on 24 February 2013.

Schelotto spent two seasons on loan to other Italian clubs from 2013–14 season to 2014–15 season; on 31 August 2015, it was agreed between the two parties Schelotto would terminate his contract by a mutual consent.

On 29 August 2013, Schelotto signed on loan with Serie A side Sassuolo. On 29 September he scored his first league goal for Sassuolo in a 2–2 draw with Lazio.

On 22 January 2014, Schelotto joined Parma along with his Sassuolo compatriot, Jonathan Rossini, signing on a loan deal.

On 25 August 2014, Schelotto joined Chievo on a seasons long loan.

On 20 November 2015, Schelotto joined Portuguese side Sporting Clube de Portugal on a three-and-a-half year contract, after being released by Internazionale in the summer of that year.

On 31 August 2017, Schelotto completed a transfer to Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion, signing a three-year contract at the south coast club.

On 28 January 2019, Schelotto joined to Chievo Verona on loan until 30 June 2019.

Thanks to his Italian ancestry, Schelotto was eligible for Italian citizenship. In November 2009, he was called up to the Italian national under-21 team, and was immediately featured in the starting lineup in a game against Hungary on 13 November.

Since making his debut, he played all available 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification matches, and unusually as right back in the last qualification match against Wales in September. In that match, Italy beat Wales 1–0 and narrowly topped Wales as the group winner. He assisted Stefano Okaka to score the second goal in the first leg of the playoff round against Belarus, but missed the second leg due to suspension. Italy were eventually eliminated due to a 0–3 loss against Belarus in Borisov.

On 10 August 2012, he was called up by Cesare Prandelli to the Italian senior team for a friendly against England, where he made his debut.

Born in Buenos Aires, Schelotto also holds an Italian passport due to his Italian descent from Cogoleto (GE), in Liguria, where his great-great-grandfather Giovanni Battista Francesco Schelotto emigrated from in the late 19th century. He is the fifth of seven children — including 5 males — two of whom are also footballers.

He made his debut in the campaign on 3 March 2007, coming on as a substitute in a 1–2 home loss against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv. Hemed scored his first professional goals on 26 May, netting his side's both goals in a 2–0 win at Maccabi Herzliya. In 2007, he travelled with the Under-21 side to that year's Torneo di Viareggio; he scored once as Haifa was knocked-out in the group stage.

Hemed was subsequently loaned to Maccabi Herzliya, Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv and Maccabi Ahi Nazareth (the latter being managed by John Gregory). Nazareth, however, finished last as Hemed scored nine goals.

Hemed returned to Maccabi Haifa in the 2010 summer, and appeared in 45 matches during the 2010–11 campaign, also scoring 18 goals as the club was crowned champions.

On 21 June 2011, Hemed signed a three-year deal with Spanish La Liga club RCD Mallorca. He made his debut in the main category of the Spanish football on 28 August, starting and being booked in a 1–0 home success against RCD Espanyol.

Hemed scored his first goals abroad on 1 October, scoring both his side's goals in a 2–2 draw at CA Osasuna. He also netted twice in his Copa del Rey debut, a 6–1 home routing over Real Sociedad on 10 January of the following year.

Hemed finished his first season abroad with nine goals, although four of them were from the penalty spot. In his second season he scored 11 goals, with the Balearic Islands outfit being relegated, however. In May 2013 Hemed suffered an Achilles tendon rupture, which kept him sidelined for seven months.

On 2 July 2014 Hemed returned to the Spanish top level, by agreeing to a two-year deal with UD Almería. After struggling to score in his first matches, he netted his first goal with the Andalusians on 4 October, the last in a 2–2 home draw against Elche CF.

He scored his first goal for the Seagulls from the penalty spot in the last moments of an away game at Fulham, to seal a 2–1 victory. Hemed scored just one goal between September 2015 and February 2016, which drew criticism from supporters, but rediscovered his early season form to finish as the club's top scorer with 17 goals.

Hemed scored 13 goals in all competitions in Brighton's promotion-winning 2016–17 season, trading starting positions regularly with top-scorer Glenn Murray and Sam Baldock in a strike force that managed to score 44 league goals between them. Highlights from Hemed throughout the season included a last gasp equaliser in a 3–3 draw away to Brentford, the only goal in a hard earned 1–0 win against Cardiff City, and a late penalty in a narrow 1–0 away win against Burton Albion.

On 9 September 2017, Hemed scored his first Premier League goal for Brighton in a 3–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion. Hemed scored again in Brighton's next home Premier League game, a 1–0 win against Newcastle United on 24 September. Three days later, the FA announced that Hemed had been given a three-match ban for a stamp on the calf of Newcastle defender DeAndre Yedlin, an incident which went unnoticed by referee Andre Marriner.

Born in South Africa, Tau began his career with Mamelodi Sundowns in the Premier Soccer League. He made his professional debut for the club on 25 February 2014 in the league against Orlando Pirates. He came on as an 85th-minute substitute for Domingues as Sundowns lost 1–0. Tau then scored his first professional goal for the club during a Nedbank Cup match on 22 March 2014 against Golden Arrows. His 90th-minute goal was the fourth and final goal for Sundowns as they won 4–1 against the Arrows. He then scored his first goal in international club competition on 5 April 2015 in a CAF Champions League match against TP Mazembe. He scored the Sundown's one and only goal of the match in the 84th minute as Mamelodi Sundowns fell 3–1. After two seasons and rarely appearing for Mamelodi Sundowns, Tau was placed on the club's release list for the 2014–15 season.

On the advice of then-youth coach Rhulani Mokwena, he was loaned to National First Division side Witbank Spurs instead. He made his debut for the club on 6 February 2016 in a 3–1 win over African Warriors and went on to score 3 goals in 11 appearances during his loan spell.

After a season with Witbank Spurs, Tau rejoined Mamelodi Sundowns and was included in the squad for the club's CAF Champions League campaign. He featured throughout and played every minute of both legs of a 3–1 aggregate win over Egyptian side Zamalek in the CAF Champions League Final. The victory was Sundowns' first ever triumph in a continental competition. He then scored his first goal in the league for the club on 2 November 2016 against Polokwane City.

His form throughout the season saw him share the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot with Rodney Ramagalela and earned him the Footballer of the Season and Players' Player of the Season awards. As a result of his achievements, Tau was courted by a number of European clubs during the off-season. Amidst the speculation surrounding his future, he refused to join Sundowns in the pre-season preparations in an attempt to force through a move.

On 20 July 2018, Tau signed a four-year contract with English Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion, for an undisclosed transfer fee, reported to be in the region of R50 million (UK£2.7 million), a South African record sale of a domestic player. Brighton manager, Chris Hughton, confirmed that Tau would be loaned out shortly after his transfer, after failing a UK work permit, as well as him wanting the South African international to gain European football experience.

Christian Walton

Christian Timothy Walton (born 9 November 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Wigan Athletic, on loan from club Brighton & Hove Albion. He has represented England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels.

Born in Wadebridge, Cornwall, Walton began his career with Plymouth Argyle aged 10 and progressed through the club's youth system. He was named in a matchday squad for the first time three days after his 16th birthday for an FA Cup first round tie against Stourbridge, in which he remained an unused substitute, the match finishing 3–3.

On 15 February 2013, Walton signed for Championship club Brighton & Hove Albion, where he completed his scholarship, before signing a three-year professional contract in the summer of 2013. He was twice an unused substitute in consecutive matches in 2013–14, a 3–1 win at home to Leicester City on 7 December, prior to a 1–0 win away to Middlesbrough one week later. Ahead of 2014–15, Walton signed a new four-year contract with the club on 8 July 2014. He was an unused substitute on the opening day of the season in a 1–0 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Walton made his professional debut for Brighton aged 18 in a 2–0 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup fourth round on 29 October. He made his Football League debut six days later in a 1–0 win at home to Wigan Athletic. Walton made his second consecutive start in a 1–1 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers on 8 November.

He made his Plymouth debut in a 2–1 defeat at home to arch-rivals Exeter City two days later. Walton started in three further matches, and returned to Brighton upon the expiration of his loan spell.

On 24 June 2016, Walton signed for League Two club Luton Town on a season-long loan, linking back up with Nathan Jones who was first-team coach for his first three years at Brighton. He made his Luton debut on the opening day of 2016–17 in a 3–0 win away to Plymouth Argyle. Walton saved a penalty from Vadaine Oliver during a 0–0 draw away to Notts County on 29 October to keep a clean sheet for Luton, which extended the club's unbeaten league run to seven matches and earned him a place in the English Football League Team of the Week.

On 1 April 2017, Walton signed for League One club Southend United on an emergency loan for an initial seven days as cover for Ted Smith who had sustained a wrist injury. He debuted later that day in a 3–0 victory at home to Oldham Athletic. It was agreed for Walton's loan to be extended by a further week as the club were still without a fit goalkeeper. The goalkeeping situation remained unchanged and therefore the loan was extended by a further week once more. Walton's loan was extended again to enable him to play in Southend's final match of 2016–17, and completed the loan spell with seven appearances.

On 12 July 2017, Walton signed for League One club Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan. He made his debut for Wigan on the opening day of 2017–18 in a 1–0 victory away to Milton Keynes Dons.

Richard Patrick Towell (born 17 July 1991) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for Rotherham United (on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion).

Towell started his career with Scottish club Celtic and made his debut in the first half of the 2010–11 season. He then had two loan spells with Hibernian before leaving Celtic in 2012.

Towell has represented the Republic of Ireland under-21, under-19 and under-17 teams

Towell started his career at Crumlin United and in 2007 moved to Celtic. In November 2010, he made his professional debut coming on as a substitute for Jos Hooiveld in the 57th minute of Celtic's 2–2 draw against Inverness, he provided an assist for Paddy McCourt.

On 25 January 2011, he joined Hibernian on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. Towell made his debut a day later, in a 2–0 loss to Rangers. He was at fault for the concession of the second Rangers goal, as a misplaced pass allowed Nikica Jelavić a clear chance to score. Despite this bad start, Towell helped to solidify the Hibs defence during the latter part of the 2010–11 season. Hibs manager Colin Calderwood stated in April 2011 that he hoped to sign Towell for a longer period. Towell said in April 2011 that he received abuse from Hearts supporters in Edinburgh derby matches because he was Catholic. However, he also said that this made him more determined to play better. Towell returned to Celtic at the end of the season, having made 15 starting appearances for Hibs.

Towell re-signed on loan for Hibs on 25 August 2011, on a deal due to run until June 2012. He played the first match of his second loan spell only 3 days later, starting as Hibs lost 2–0 to Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Towell started to find first-team opportunities limited after new manager Pat Fenlon made several siginings in the January transfer window. Two right backs and two central midfielders came in with one other right back going out. However, Fenlon said that once Towell had got his fitness levels up he would be back in the first team picture.

Towell was signed by Stephen Kenny for Dundalk in December 2012, ahead of the 2013 Airtricity Premier Division season.

Towell made his League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers on the opening night of the 2013 season and was hugely influential in Dundalk’s second-placed finish that year, scoring seven times in 31 league appearances. He also picked up the PFAI Young Player of the Year award. He won back to back league titles with Dundalk in 2014 and 2015 scoring 11 and 25 goals in the respective seasons, and got his first taste of Champions League football with the League of Ireland champions.

Towell signed for Brighton & Hove Albion on 30 November 2015. Towell made his debut for the Sussex club in the third round of the 2015-16 FA Cup on 9 January 2016 away against Hull City where The Seagulls lost 1-0 to a Robert Snodgrass penalty. 
Despite not playing a single league game in the 2015-16 Football League Championship season Towell made an appearance in the 2016 Championship play-offs as a substitute away against Sheffield Wednesday where Brighton were beaten 2-0 and 3-1 on aggregate. Towell scored his first goal for The Albion in a 3-1 FA Cup loss away to then National League side Lincoln on 28 January 2017. Towell's only league game to date with The Seagulls came against his then future loan club Rotherham on 7 March 2017 where he came on as a substitute where Brighton won 2-0 at the New York Stadium. At the end of the season Brighton & Hove Albion were promoted to the Premier League.
In May 2017, following Brighton's promotion to the Premier League, Towell signed a deal to keep him at the club until 2019.

On 31 August 2017, he signed for League One's Rotherham on a season-long loan where he helped them regain their Championship status, winning the 2018 EFL League One play-offs. On 31 August 2018 he returned to Rotherham United for a second season-long loan spell.

In May 2008, Towell made his Republic of Ireland under-17's debut in a European championship match against Switzerland. He gained his second Ireland under-17 cap four days later, against Spain.
