Marcus Bettinelli

Marcus Bettinelli (born 24 May 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Fulham. He has been capped by the England national under-21 team and called up for the senior team.

Bettinelli was born in Camberwell, London. He started his career with Fulham, signing his first professional contract in July 2010.

Bettinelli joined Conference Premier club Dartford on 17 August 2012 on a one-month loan to gain first-team experience. He made his debut a day later, in a 2–0 away loss against Macclesfield Town. Having made seven appearances so far, his loan spell was extended for another month. This would happen again, as it was extended until Christmas. He went on to make 42 appearances in all competitions before being recalled by Fulham on 26 March 2013.

Bettinelli joined League Two club Accrington Stanley on 28 August 2013 on a one-month loan. He made his debut the same day in the League Cup against Cardiff City in a 2–0 home defeat. His Football League debut on 31 August, in a 1–0 home defeat to Burton Albion.￼￼ Fulham confirmed on 2 September 2013 that Bettinelli would stay with Accrington for the rest of the 2013–14 season, but he was recalled on 26 December and was named as a substitute in Fulham's 2–1 away win over Norwich City in the league as cover for David Stockdale. On 3 January 2014, he re-joined Accrington Stanley on loan until 30 January 2014.

Bettinelli agreed a two-year extension to his Fulham contract on 10 January 2014, which would keep him at the club until June 2016. He made his debut for the club on 26 August in the second round of the League Cup away to West London rivals Brentford, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory. Four days later he made his league debut for Fulham in the Championship, a 1–1 home draw with Cardiff City. On 5 December, he was sent off after 18 minutes in a 5–0 loss to Watford at Craven Cottage for fouling Matěj Vydra, conceding a penalty that Troy Deeney put past substitute goalkeeper Gábor Király.

Bettinelli signed another contract extension on 30 August 2017, keeping him at Fulham until June 2020 with an option in the club's favour to extend for a further year. He was second-choice to David Button for all but the last six matches of the 2016–17 EFL Championship season and thought that his Fulham career was over, but manager Slaviša Jokanović eventually made him the starting goalkeeper for the following season. Fulham finished third and qualified for the play-offs, defeating Derby County 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-final and Aston Villa 1–0 in the final at Wembley Stadium.

In October 2018, Bettinelli signed a new contract to last until 2021. For 2018–19, he lost his place to on-loan Spaniard Sergio Rico shortly before Jokanović's dismissal in November, and the situation remained the same under new manager Claudio Ranieri. He ended his season in February 2019 when he was ruled out for six months following a knee operation.

In November 2014, Bettinelli was called up to the England U21 squad for the first time for matches against Portugal and France. He made his debut for the under-21 side in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 27 March 2015 in a 1–0 away win. This proved to be his only appearance for the under-21 team.

In September 2018, he was called up to the England squad for matches against Spain and Switzerland.

He is the son of Fulham Academy goalkeeping coach Vic Bettinelli. Bettinelli is of partial Italian descent on his father's side.

Ryan Sessegnon

Kouassi Ryan Sessegnon (born 18 May 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back or left winger for club Fulham and the England under-21 national team.

Sessegnon made his breakthrough in the Fulham senior side in 2016, aged 16. He made an instant impact, becoming the first footballer born in the 2000s to score a goal in a first-team game in the professional English leagues, and the youngest player to score in a Championship match. In 2016–17, his second season, Sessegnon helped Fulham achieve promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs, scoring fifteen goals and winning numerous personal awards.

Sessegnon was born in Roehampton, London, and has a twin brother, Steven, who also plays for Fulham. Their elder brother, Chris, is a semi-professional footballer. Sessegnon is a distant cousin of the Beninese international footballer Stéphane Sessègnon.

He joined Fulham in 2008, alongside brother Steven, joining their Under-9s team. Originally a central striker at youth level, he was moved to left back as he progressed. He has cited fellow left-sided players Luke Shaw and Gareth Bale as players he looked up to when he was young, saying, 'when Shaw was at Southampton he was a left-back and I loved watching him bomb up and down the wing, create goals, score goals, so I think I try to emulate that.'

Sessegnon attended Coombe Boys' School in New Malden, London, close to Fulham's Motspur Park training ground. With both brothers in the team, Coombe Boys won youth competition the ESFA PlayStation Schools’ Cup in both 2014 and 2015, Ryan scoring twice in the 2015 final. By the 2015–16 season, Sessegnon had become a regular for Fulham's Under-18 side, despite only being 15.

Having started training with the first team, still aged 15, in March 2016, Sessegnon was promoted to the senior squad by manager Slavisa Jokanovic for the 2016–17 pre-season. He scored his first senior goal on 19 July in a 3-0 friendly win over Brighton and Hove Albion.

On 9 August, Sessegnon made his first-team debut in an EFL Cup match against Leyton Orient aged 16 years and 81 days. On 16 August, he made his league debut in a Championship match against Leeds United in a 1–1 draw. On 20 August, he scored his first professional goal in a league match against Cardiff City, becoming the first professional footballer in the English leagues to have been born in the 2000s to score a goal in a first-team game and the youngest player to score in a Championship match. He scored the winner on his FA Cup debut, also against Cardiff, on 8 January, becoming one of the youngest goalscorers in the history of the competition. 

On 11 March, Sessegnon scored twice in an away match against eventual league champions Newcastle United, with former Newcastle player Alan Shearer praising his performance as "brilliant". In total, Sessegnon made 30 appearances in all competitions, including in the second leg of Fulham's play-off semi-final defeat against Reading, scoring seven goals, and was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year, the youngest player ever included.

Media interest in Sessegnon grew as his debut season progressed. In February 2017, Italian newspaper "La Gazzetta dello Sport" ranked Sessegnon as one of the top 30 Under-20s players in Europe, while in May 2017, "Sports Illustrated" named him as the 19th-best under-20 player in world football. Fulham striker Neeskens Kebano called him "the future of English football", with teammate Stefan Johansen saying it was "99% certain he will be one of the top left-backs in the world". 

As the summer transfer window approached, interest was reported from numerous Premier League clubs, including Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United, as well as Bundesliga sides Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, with Sessegnon potentially available for a compensation fee of £2 million as Football Association rules meant he could not sign professional terms until his 17th birthday on 18 May 2017. However, on 28 June 2017, it was announced Sessegnon had signed his first professional contract with Fulham, committing him to the club until 2020. Sessegnon cited the likelihood of playing regularly in the first team as his reason, saying, "Last season I got a lot of opportunities so I want to continue that. When you are young you just want to play as many games as you can."

On 28 July 2017, Fulham announced that Sessegnon would wear the number 3 shirt, moving from his previous number 30. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Cardiff on 9 September. In November 2017, "FourFourTwo" included Sessegnon in their 100 Best Teenagers in the World list, comparing him with Ashley Cole and David Alaba. On 21 November 2017, Sessegnon marked his 50th appearance for Fulham by scoring his first professional hat-trick in a 5–4 away victory against Sheffield United – becoming the first seventeen-year-old to score a hat-trick in the top four tiers of English league football since Dele Alli in 2014. After netting six goals in January 2018, courtesy of braces against Ipswich Town, Burton Albion and Barnsley, Sessegnon was named PFA and Championship Player of the Month. On 19 February, Sessegnon was named tenth in the most promising under 20 prospects in the whole of Europe. Sessegnon featured in a prestigious list by CIES with the likes of Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma featuring in 1st place and Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappé in 3rd place.

In April 2018 he was nominated for the EFL Championship Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards. He also became the first Championship player to be nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award. On 15 April, Sessegnon won an unprecedented five awards when he was named Championship Player of the Season, Young Player of the Season, Apprentice of the Year, and named in the Team of the Season and EFL Club Developed XI.

Fulham finished the league season in third place, allowing them to advance to the play-offs, where Sessegnon helped his side secure a place in the play-off final by scoring the opening goal and assisting the game-winning goal in the semi-final second leg against Derby County. On 26 May, Sessegnon assisted Tom Cairney's 23rd minute goal in a 1–0 win against Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final at Wembley to secure Fulham's promotion to the Premier League.

Sessegnon made his first Premier League appearance on 11 August 2018, the opening day of the new league campaign, in a 2–0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. On 20 October, he scored his first Premier League goal in a 4–2 away loss to Cardiff City, becoming the first player born in the 2000s to score in the competition. He made his 100th appearance for the club on 8 December, starting in a 4–1 league loss to Manchester United.

In 2016, Sessegnon played up an age group to represent England in the U17 Euros. He scored his first goal for England Under-19s against Luxembourg in a European Under-19 Championship qualifier on 10 November 2016, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win.

On 26 June 2017, Sessegnon was named in the final 18-man squad for the Euro U19s finals. He went on to score three goals, including two in a 4–1 win over Germany, finishing the tournament as joint-top scorer as England were crowned champions for the first time. He was subsequently included in the team of the tournament.

Aged 17, Sessegnon made his debut for England Under-21s on 27 March 2018, starting in a 2-1 European Under-21 Championship qualifier win over Ukraine.

Calum Chambers

Calum Chambers (born 20 January 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Fulham, on loan from fellow club Arsenal, and the England national team.

Originally a member of Southampton's academy system, Chambers was promoted to the first team at the beginning of the 2012–13 campaign. After two seasons with the club, he moved to fellow Premier League club Arsenal.

Chambers made his senior international debut for the English national team in 2014.

Born in Petersfield, Hampshire, Chambers joined Southampton at the age of seven. He went through the ranks at the club and at the beginning of the 2012–13 season, Chambers was revealed as one of four youth players to be promoted to the first-team. During the pre-season period he made a number of appearances for the team, playing in the Memorial Cup against Anderlecht, coming on as a second-half substitute in the matches against Évian Thonon Gaillard and Étoile Carouge, and making late appearances against Ajax and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Chambers made his full debut for Southampton on 28 August 2012 in a 4–1 win over Stevenage in the second round of the League Cup, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute for Dean Hammond and providing the assist for the final goal of the match by Ben Reeves.

On 31 July 2013, Chambers signed a new four-year contract with Southampton.

He made his first-team league debut on 17 August 2013, when he played the full 90 minutes at right-back of the opening match of the 2013–14 season in a 1–0 win against West Bromwich Albion. He made a total of 25 appearances for Southampton in all competitions, of which 22 were in the league, before leaving in the summer of 2014.

On 28 July 2014, it was announced that he had signed for Arsenal on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee, rising to a potential £16 million with performance-related add-ons.

Chambers made his first appearance for Arsenal on 2 August 2014, starting in central defence in a 5–1 win against Benfica in the pre-season Emirates Cup tournament. On 10 August, Chambers made his competitive debut for Arsenal, playing the full 90 minutes of the 2014 FA Community Shield against Premier League champions Manchester City at Wembley Stadium. Playing at centre back instead of his usual right back position to cover for Per Mertesacker, the BBC wrote on his performance against the Premier League champions that "his mature performance defied his youthful years". On 16 August, Chambers played his first Premier League match for Arsenal in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace. He played the first European fixture of his career three days later, a goalless draw in the first leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off away to Beşiktaş.

Following a strong start to the season, Chambers was nominated for the Golden Boy Award 2014, alongside international teammates Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and John Stones. He scored the first senior goal of his career and registered an assist on 1 November as Arsenal beat Burnley 3–0 in a Premier League home victory. He was sent off for the first time in his career on 6 December, as Arsenal lost 3–2 at Stoke City.

Chambers' appearances in the second half of the season were limited by the emergence of Héctor Bellerín at right-back. He was not in Arsenal's matchday squad when they won the 2015 FA Cup Final 4–0 against Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium on 30 May.

Chambers began the 2016–17 Premier League in the starting line-up for Arsenal and scored in a 3–4 loss against Liverpool in the first match of the season.

On 30 August 2016, he joined fellow Premier League team Middlesbrough on a season-long loan.

On 3 July 2018, Chambers signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.

On 7 August 2018, Chambers signed with fellow Premier League side Fulham on a season long loan.

Chambers made his debut for the England under-17 team on 2 February against Portugal. In March, he played in all three of the team's matches in the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship elite round, scoring their only goal of the tournament in a 1–0 win over Ukraine.

On 26 September 2012, Chambers made the step up to the England under-19 team, playing the full 90 minutes in the team's 3–0 win over the Estonia under-19 team in the 2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifying round. On 28 September Chambers came on as a second-half substitute in the England under-19 team's match against the Faroe Islands, which England won 6–0, scoring the final goal of the match in the 84th minute. He scored his second under-19 international goal in a 1–0 victory against Turkey on 21 March 2013.

He made his debut against Norway on 3 September, coming on for the last 9 minutes in place of John Stones as England won 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. Initially chosen for the under-21 team, Chambers moved into the senior squad ahead of European qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia in October 2014 due to an injury to Stones. He was given his first start on his second cap, against San Marino on 9 October at Wembley Stadium, playing at right back ahead of his former Southampton teammate Nathaniel Clyne.

Chambers then dropped back down to the under-21 team in March 2015, and made his debut in a 1–0 win against Czech Republic in Prague. He was part of the team that won the 2016 Toulon Tournament, their first such win for 22 years.

Kevin McDonald

Kevin Hamilton McDonald (born May 16, 1961) is a Canadian actor, voice actor and comedian. He is known as a member of "The Kids in the Hall", the voice of Agent Pleakley in the "Lilo & Stitch" franchise, Waffle in "Catscratch", Pastor Dave in "That 70s Show", and the Almighty Tallest Purple in "Invader Zim". Kevin also stars as a co-pilot in the 2011 web comedy series "Papillon".

McDonald was born in Montréal, Québec, the son of Sheila and Hamilton "Hammy" McDonald, who was a dental equipment salesman. He moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of seven, after his father was transferred there. His family subsequently lived in Toronto, Ontario as well. McDonald has a younger sister, Sandra.

During an interview on "WTF with Marc Maron", McDonald discussed his father's severe alcoholism, which inspired the "Kids In The Hall" sketches "Daddy Drank" and "Girl Drink Drunk". Although he calls his mother "a wonderful woman," she was nevertheless reluctant to leave him until Kevin turned 19, when his father's drinking had escalated to two bottles of vodka daily. McDonald, his mother and sister rented an apartment, where they quietly moved their belongings "every night [after his father would] collapse on the stairs." Once they had completely moved, his parents divorced, his father lost his job, went bankrupt and lived in a homeless shelter for a year, during which he abstained from drinking (although he alleged "his roommates were drinking Drano"); coincidentally, Kevin McDonald would use the same building to rehearse with "The Kids In The Hall" as they were starting out on stage. His father was able to find employment at a flower shop, then an apartment and, over time, resume his career in dental equipment sales. Eventually, he did drink again, but not to the extent he had earlier in his life. He died of an aneurysm in 2004. Kevin McDonald would use his relationship with his father as the basis for a one-man show, "Hammy And The Kids", in which he said he had no happy ending to the story of his father; but, during his interview with Marc Maron, he said after one performance of his one-man show, he was approached by a stranger who said that he had served his father as a bartender, and that his father mentioned how proud he was of his son, the famous comedian, which moved McDonald to tears "like the ending to a bad movie."

McDonald briefly studied acting at a community college, where he was kicked out for being "a one-legged actor" (i.e. he could perform comedy, but not drama) by a dean who had a leg amputated, and was therefore a literal one-legged actor. However, William B. Davis, who would later find fame in his portrayal of Cigarette Smoking Man on "The X-Files", was one of his professors, saw McDonald's potential and encouraged him to pursue improv comedy by giving him the number to The Second City in Toronto.

During his youth, he had a weight problem. It wasn't until just prior to "The Kids in the Hall" in the late 1980s that he went from overweight to rather skinny. Several sketches and monologues allude to the issue, and a stockier McDonald can be seen in archival footage on "The Kids in the Hall" on DVD box sets.

McDonald founded The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe with his friend Dave Foley. They met in Toronto at the Second City Training Center, and the two wrote and performed in sketches together more than any other pair in the group. In the troupe's TV show and stage shows, he portrays several popular recurring characters, such as the King of Empty Promises, Sir Simon Milligan, and Jerry Sizzler. A frequent running gag was that McDonald is the least popular member and always struggling not to get kicked out.

When the troupe ended the five-season run of its eponymous television series in 1994, the five members moved to a number of solo projects. McDonald has played roles in movies like "Boy Meets Girl", Agent Pleakley in the "Lilo & Stitch" franchise, and Harry Potter in "Epic Movie". On television, he has appeared on "The Martin Short Show", "Ellen" (as a radio personality), "That '70s Show" (as a confused young cleric, Pastor Dave), "Seinfeld", "Friends", "NewsRadio" (on which Foley starred), "MADtv", "Arrested Development", and "Corner Gas". McDonald has also done voice work for various animated series, including "Invader Zim" (in which he did the voice for Almighty Tallest Purple), "The Angry Beavers", "Catscratch" (in which he voiced Waffle), and "". He also played an imaginary friend named Ivan in the "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" episode "Sight For Sore Eyes", and appeared in the music video for "Roses" by OutKast.

In 2006, McDonald hosted a CBC Television special, "Sketch with Kevin McDonald", featuring several of Canada's best-known sketch comedy troupes. The special received two nominations, for the performances by The Minnesota Wrecking Crew and by The Imponderables, for Canadian Comedy Award in the category Best Taped Live Performance, with The Minnesota Wrecking Crew winning the award.

Since 2000, McDonald and the other members of The Kids in the Hall have reunited for a number of tours and televised performances. The troupe played the 2007 Just for Laughs festival, where McDonald also performed his one-and-a half-man show "Hammy and the Kids" with Craig Northey, based on his two dysfunctional families, his father ("Hammy") and The Kids in the Hall.

Neeskens Kebano

Neeskens Kebano (born 10 March 1992) is a professional footballer who plays for English club Fulham. He plays as an attacking midfielder and a winger. Kebano is a former French youth international having earned caps at under-17, under-18 level, and under-19 level. He made his youth international debut at the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship.

Kebano was born in the commune of Montereau-Fault-Yonne, Île-de-France. He was given the first name "Neeskens" as a homage to the former Dutch international midfielder Johan Neeskens whom his father, Nestor Kebano, was a big admirer of. Kebano was immersed into football at an early age and began his career playing for hometown club ASA Montereau. While at Montereau, he also competed in judo before opting to focus on football. In 2004, Kebano was among a host of players attempting to earn selection to the Clairefontaine academy. While at the academy's detection camp, he drew interest from Paris Saint-Germain scout Pierre Reynaud. The club contacted the player and offered him a trial at the club, which he accepted. After spending the 2005 season playing at Montereau, Kebano was contacted again by Paris Saint-Germain who brought him in for a second trial in December 2005. In the following January, the club signed him on an "aspirant" (youth) contract and he joined the club in July 2006.

Kebano began his Paris Saint-Germain career at the club's youth academy in the Camp des Loges. He was placed on the club's under-14 team and formed friendships with youth and international teammates Jimmy Kamghain, Alassane Tambe, and Bastien Héry. The combination of the four were particularly instrumental in their youth team's success. With the under-14 team, Kebano won the "Championnat Fédéraux de 14 ans". In the next season with the club's under-15 team, he played on the team that won the league and cup double. The team won its league, the Division d'Honneur, and also captured the Coupe de Paris. At under-16 level, Paris Saint-Germain and Kebano won the "Championnat National des 16 ans". Though, he is still eligible to compete at youth level, ahead of the 2010–11 season, Kebano was promoted to the club's Championnat de France amateur team in the fourth division. He was also placed onto the club's squad for the UEFA Europa League being assigned the number 38 shirt by manager Antoine Kombouaré.

Kebano made his amateur debut on 8 August 2010 in a 1–0 victory over Bourg-Péronnas. The following week, he scored his first amateur goal in a 4–1 win over Monts d'Or Azergues. After rotating between the club's reserve and Coupe Gambardella teams in the fall campaign, in December 2011, Kebano was called up to the senior team for the first time to participate in the club's final Europa League group stage match against Ukrainian club Karpaty Lviv. He appeared on the substitute's bench, but failed to make his debut as Paris Saint-Germain and Karpaty drew 1–1. After the winter break, Kebano returned to the club's reserve team and spent January playing with the team. In February 2011, he was called back up to the senior team after being named to the 18-man roster to play amateur club Martigues in the Coupe de France. On 2 February, Kebano made his professional debut in the match appearing as a substitute for Mevlüt Erdinç in a 4–1 victory. He scored his first professional goal for the club on 2 March 2011 in a 2–0 win over Le Mans in the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France.

On 14 August 2012, Kebano was loaned to Ligue 2 side SM Caen. As the 2012–13 season ended, Kebano was released to Charleroi.

On 26 August 2016, Kebano signed for Fulham on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, with a club option for an additional 12 months. He scored his first goal for Fulham in a 3–2 win against Wigan Athletic on 11 February 2017.

Kebano is now a DR Congo international player. His first game was against Ivory Coast in Abidjan on 15 October 2014. His team won 3–4 and he scored the very first goal of the game after 23 minutes. In the past he was a French youth international having earned caps at under-17, under-18 level, and under-19 level. With the under-17 team, he went unnoticed by coach Philippe Bergeroo until the Elite Round of qualification for the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship when he was finally called up to the team. Kebano made his youth international debut on 24 March 2009 in the team's first Elite Round group stage match against Belarus. He appeared in the team's next group stage match against Norway and, after France qualified for the competition, was named to the team to participate in the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. Kebano appeared in all three group stage matches as France were eliminated without procuring a victory. In the team's final group stage match against Italy, Kebano scored the opening goal in a 2–1 defeat.

With the under-18 team, Kebano made his debut on 27 October 2009 in a friendly match against Denmark. He scored his first goal for the team on 10 December in a 1–1 draw with the Ukraine. At the 2010 edition of the Copa del Atlantico on the Canary Islands, Kebano scored the second goal in a 4–2 rout of Spain. He finished the under-18 campaign with eight appearances and two goals. Kebano was called up to the under-19 team in August 2010 to play in the Sendai Cup in Japan. He appeared in all three matches as France finished in third place. In October 2010, he played in qualification matches for the 2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. On 10 October, in the team's second group stage match against Montenegro, Kebano scored the opening goal in a 2–0 victory.

Tom Cairney

Thomas Cairney (born 20 January 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Fulham and the Scotland national team. Cairney has previously played for Hull City and Blackburn Rovers. Born in England, he made his full international debut for Scotland in March 2017. Cairney had previously represented Scotland at under-19 and under-21 levels.

Cairney was born and raised in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, to a Scottish father, who worked as a miner and then as a taxi driver. He also revealed that his father would take him to Scotland and watch Celtic as a youngster. When he was about 15 or 16, he worked for Barclays Bank for work experience. He described this as the "worst two weeks of [his] life!" and had to work 9–5 in a bank and wear suit and tie for two weeks.

Cairney was released from the Leeds United youth system at the age of 16 after being told he was too small. He had been with the club since the age of seven. Reflecting on his time at Leeds United, he said: "To be honest it crushed me, it crushed me a lot, I was with Leeds from I was seven to 16 so it was a big part of my life. I was going there three-four times a week, missing days of schools, and obviously my mum and dad had put a lot into it too. So getting released at 16, it just felt like, ‘oh no, after all that effort’. But I was determined I would not stop there. I went to Hull and they offered me a YTS as they obviously saw something. And from 16–18 I shot up in height and then it went back to my footballing ability. From getting released at 16 to making my Premier League debut – if you wrote it down you wouldn't believe it. I owe a lot to (then Hull manager) Phil Brown as he believed in me. I think the academy staff at Leeds must have got a bit of a shock when they saw me playing in the Premier League! I don’t know what happened to them but I think they may have got a telling off!"

Hull City gave Cairney a chance when they signed him to a youth contract in 2007. Cairney was named as Hull's Young Player of the Year for the 2008–09 season. For this, he signed a two-year contract with the club in June 2009.

Ryan Babel

Ryan Guno Babel (; born 19 December 1986) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Fulham and the Netherlands national team. He can play as a striker or left winger.

Babel began his career at Ajax in 1998, working his way up through the youth team and into the senior squad. He played three seasons for the first team before he was transferred to Liverpool in mid-2007, where under three successive managers he failed to secure a regular first team position. Babel was sold to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in January 2011, for a sum around half of that which Liverpool paid for him. His time at Hoffenheim was marred with disciplinary problems with three managers at the club. In the summer of 2012, Babel bought out the remaining final year of his contract, making him a free agent, and re-signed a one-year contract with Ajax. After this season, Babel went on to sign with Turkish club Kasımpaşa on 21 June 2013. Babel often was linked to a return to the Premier League during his time in Turkey, before ending rumours by signing for UAE side Al Ain FC in July 2015.

Babel has been part of the Netherlands national team since 2005, and has represented his country at all youth team levels. He played in two World Cups, 2006 and 2010, reaching the final of the latter.

Babel was born in Amsterdam. Inspired by the local footballing talent, including Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, Babel played for nearby youth-teams S.V Diemen, then Fortius. In 1997, he attended a youth selection day with AFC Ajax. He made it through the first selection round, but failed to progress any further. However, the next year Ajax accepted him and he played the 1999–2000 season for their D1 team. After having graduated through the C1, B1 and A1 teams, Babel signed his first professional contract in January 2004.

Playing as a striker, on 1 February 2004, just one and a half months after his 17th birthday, Babel made his first-team debut in Ajax's 4–0 home win over ADO Den Haag in the Eredivisie. Ajax went on to win the Dutch league title, but Babel didn't feature again that season. Nine months later, on 20 November 2004 Babel scored his first senior goal against De Graafschap in a 5–0 victory.

In July 2005, Babel signed a new contract with Ajax. He started the new season by scoring the winning goal in Ajax's 2–1 defeat of PSV Eindhoven in the Johan Cruyff Shield. Babel scored in both legs of the Champions League third qualifying round against Brøndby as Ajax made it to the group stage. 2005–06 was a tougher season for Babel in general though as he managed only two league goals. He did however continue to feature for the national team, and scored his second goal against Italy in November. At the end of the season, Babel came on as a second-half substitute in Ajax's 2–1 victory over PSV in the KNVB Cup final.

Babel marked the start of 2006–07 with another Johan Cruyff Shield medal, as Ajax defeated PSV 3–1. Babel was linked with Arsenal and Newcastle United during the January transfer window of the 2006–07 season but no move materialised. Amidst the transfer speculation, Babel agreed to a new three-year deal with Ajax on 2 February 2007. In May, Babel got another Dutch Cup winners medal as Ajax successfully defended the title. The match against AZ went to a penalty shoot-out, but Babel was substituted off after 120 minutes.

On 10 July 2007 it was reported that Liverpool had made a £14 million offer to the Amsterdam club. On 12 July it was reported that Liverpool and Ajax had agreed a fee in the region of £11.5 million, and later Liverpool confirmed that Babel would sign a five-year contract on 13 July. He was unveiled on 13 July with Yossi Benayoun. Babel was handed the number 19 shirt. He made his debut on 17 July against Werder Bremen in a friendly. He was due to play in the first round of the Barclays Asia Trophy 2007 but had a delay in the granting of international clearance. This was sorted out in time for the final against Portsmouth.

He made his Premier League debut in the 2007–08 Premier League curtain raiser against Aston Villa away after coming on off the bench. A week later he made his Anfield debut, coming off the bench against Chelsea. On 1 September Babel scored his first goal for Liverpool against Derby County. Babel scored his first Champions League goal for Liverpool on 6 November against Beşiktaş J.K. after coming on as a substitute. He netted twice in the game and almost completed a hat-trick, with a header from a Harry Kewell cross, but was denied by the crossbar. Babel scored the fourth and last goal in Liverpool's 2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage match against Olympique de Marseille, which they needed to win. He came off the bench in the second leg of the quarter final against Arsenal in the Champions League and won a penalty and scored a goal, with Liverpool winning the game 4–2 (5–3 on aggregate). He also came on as a substitute against Chelsea in the semi-final and despite scoring a goal, Liverpool lost 3–2 in extra time.

Former Liverpool and Celtic player Kenny Dalglish has said that Babel has the ability to terrorise defenders in the Premier League with his pace and trickery with the ball. On 13 September 2008, Babel came off the bench to score the winner for Liverpool in a 2–1 victory over Manchester United, his first goal of the 2008–09 season Babel scored his second goal of the season in Liverpool's 5–1 victory over Newcastle United on 28 December 2008.

On 20 September 2009, against West Ham, Babel came off the bench for Dirk Kuyt. At this stage the score was 2–2. Babel picked up the ball and did well to beat the full-back and sent in a delightful cross for Fernando Torres to head home the winner. Babel, who has been criticised in the past for his work rate and attitude, earned praise for his efforts in the West Ham game.
On 27 September 2009, Babel scored two goals against Hull City coming off the bench for Fernando Torres to round up a match which ended 6–1 for Liverpool. On 4 November 2009, Babel scored the opening goal against Lyon in a Champions League game, a strike from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw. Former Liverpool player Alan Hansen called upon Babel to play like he did against Lyon, as he still possessed the ability to be a 'top player'.

On 6 January 2010, it was reported that Liverpool rejected an £8 million offer from Birmingham City for Babel. Babel was then disciplined by manager Benitez, over stating on his Twitter page that he had been dropped for the game against Stoke City, and was fined two weeks wages of £120,000. He was frequently linked with a move away from Anfield but Rafael Benitez stated his desire for Babel to stay. On 15 March 2010 he scored against Portsmouth in a 4–1 win. On 1 April 2010, he was sent off for the first time in his Liverpool career in the 30th minute of the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final against S.L. Benfica after an altercation with Luisão. He scored in Liverpool's 4–0 win over Burnley at Turf Moor, subsequently relegating Burnley to the Championship.
On 19 August 2010, Babel scored the winner against Trabzonspor in the Europa League qualifier first leg, it was his first game of the 2010–11 season. He started his first match in the Premier League at Anfield against Aston Villa and scored his first goal in the Premier League with a right-footed volley that beat former Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Friedel.

Babel gained further notoriety amongst fans when, on transfer deadline day 31 August 2010, it was reported that the player was travelling by helicopter between Liverpool and an unspecified London location as possible transfer talks with Tottenham and West Ham were ongoing, and there was speculation about his true destination. No transfer actually occurred and the helicopter story may be apocryphal, but the image stuck and the term "Babelcopter" became a metaphor for players with an uncertain destination on future transfer deadline days, with the player himself promoting the use of the hashtag #BabelCopter.

One of the first Premier League players to use Twitter to communicate with fans, in January 2011, Babel posted a photoshopped image on Twitter of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United shirt following Liverpool's 1–0 defeat to United in the FA Cup. He was subsequently charged by the F.A. with improper conduct and fined £10,000.

On 18 January, Liverpool agreed a fee believed to be in the region of £7 million for Babel from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. On 24 January, Kenny Dalglish said that Babel would be staying at Liverpool, but the next day Babel flew to Germany to finalise the deal to sign with Hoffenheim.

On 25 January 2011, it was confirmed that Babel had left Liverpool to join German side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim for a reported fee of £8 million, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal.

On 9 April 2011, Babel scored his first goal for Hoffenheim, in a 3–2 loss to SC Freiburg.
In the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, Babel netted his first league goal of the season on 20 August 2011 against Augsburg in a 2–0 away win. On 10 September 2011, he scored his first brace for 1899 Hoffenheim in a 4–0 win against Mainz 05 and scored again in the next game on 17 September in a 3–1 win over VfL Wolfsburg.

After playing for Hoffenheim for 18 months, scoring six goals in 51 matches, he was released by the club on 31 August 2012.

After personally buying off the remaining year of his contract with Hoffenheim, he returned to his old club Ajax on a one-year deal. Wearing shirt number 49, the same number he wore when he made his first ever appearance for the first team at Ajax, he made his debut with Ajax for the 2012–13 season on 15 September 2012, in a regular season match against RKC Waalwijk. He came on as a substitute for Derk Boerrigter in the second half, assisting Jody Lukoki on the second goal in the 2–0 home win for the Amsterdam side. He scored his first goal since returning to Ajax in a match against ADO Den Haag on 23 September 2012.

Struggling with a slight injury midway through the season, Babel managed to play a total of 16 league matches for Ajax, scoring four goals in total in the Eredivisie. He also made four appearances in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, as well as two more appearances in the 2012–13 KNVB Cup, where he scored the second goal in the '15-minute of the second round fixture against FC Utrecht, with the match ending 3–0 for the Amsterdam side prior to his injury. He would return to action after being sidelined to help his side secure their 3rd consecutive national title and 32nd overall.

Opting not to extend his contract with Ajax in order to make way for the next generation, Babel decided to join Turkish side Kasımpaşa where former Ajax player Shota Arveladze was the current manager. He was joined in Turkey by fellow Amsterdam born defender Ryan Donk who made the transfer from Belgian side Club Brugge.

Babel signed a contract with UAE Arabian Gulf League champions Al Ain to replace the outgoing Miroslav Stoch. He signed the contract after passing a medical test on 2 July 2015. In December 2015, Al Ain and Babel were involved in a conflict over Babel's disciplinary issues with the club's hierarchy and regarding his use of social media. The club demoted him to the reserves citing poor performance.

In January 2017, Babel joined Beşiktaş on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Despite only joining the club in January, Babel became a crucial member of the squad that season, making 18 league appearances and scoring 5 goals as he helped Beşiktaş secure their fifteenth league title.

On 15 January 2019, Babel signed for Premier League club Fulham on a contract until the end of the 2018–19 season.

Babel took part in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship. Babel scored two goals in four games as the Netherlands reached the quarter-finals. There they were defeated by Nigeria, 10–9 in a penalty shoot-out (Babel scored his penalty).

Later that season, Babel made his international debut on 26 March 2005, away against Romania. He entered the game as a first-half substitute for Arjen Robben and went on to score the second goal in a 2–0 victory. The goal made Babel the youngest goalscorer in 68 years for the Netherlands and the fourth-youngest of all time. Babel had been a first team regular with Ajax in 2004–05 and finished with seven league goals in 22 appearances.

In 2006, Marco van Basten included Babel in the Dutch squad for 2006 FIFA World Cup. Due to a knee injury however, Babel only featured once, as a second-half substitute for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the group match against Argentina. Van Basten has been quoted as saying Babel "has all the potential to become the next Thierry Henry".

In June 2007, Babel was part of the Netherlands under-21 team competing in the UEFA Under-21 Championship, being held in the Netherlands. In the group stage, Babel scored a penalty against Portugal, helping the Dutch to secure a semi-final spot and thus qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. His second tournament goal came during his man of the match performance in the final as the Netherlands defeated Serbia 4–1 to retain their title.

In May 2008, Babel was selected for the Dutch squad which would compete in the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. On 31 May, it was announced that Babel had been withdrawn from the squad after tearing ankle ligaments in training. Van Basten added then-Chelsea defender Khalid Boulahrouz to his squad in place of Babel.

Babel was included in the preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager Bert van Marwijk announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the competition.

Upon the conclusion of the 2010 season, he was named the team's Defender of the Year, and he was one of three listed candidates for MLS Rookie of the Year.

During Ream's second season in New York, he played and started in 28 of 34 matches during the regular season; he missed 6 matches largely due to international call-ups during the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

In December 2011, during the MLS off-season, Ream spent a short time training with both West Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers with permission from the Red Bulls to maintain his fitness during the winter break. At the beginning of January 2012, Bolton made a transfer offer of £2.5m for him. The bid was accepted and after personal terms were agreed he received a work permit on January 24.

Bolton completed the signing of Ream on January 26, 2012, on a three-and-a-half-year deal. He canceled his honeymoon so that he could sign for Bolton. He was given the number 32 shirt and made his debut for the club in Bolton's 2–0 FA Cup win at Millwall on February 18. He made his Premier League debut the following weekend in Bolton's 3–0 defeat at Chelsea. On March 10, 2012, he assisted Darren Pratley's opening goal in a 2–1 win over Queens Park Rangers. He went on to appear ten games straight towards the end of the season, but was unable to help the club survive relegation in the Premier League.

For the start of the 2012–13 season, Ream was given the number 5 shirt, previously worn by Gary Cahill. He was given his first start of the 2012–13 season in a 2–0 loss against Burnley. However, he was sidelined from the first team, due to losing his starting place and was relegated to the substitutes bench. Despite this, Ream went on to make fifteen appearances.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Ream was linked with a move to Middlesbrough, a move that was denied by the club and Ream. After appearing the first three matches as an unused substitute, he started as defensive midfielder for four matches in September. In early February 2014, he was forced to wear a protective mask in Wanderers games after a collision with Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin. Throughout the 2013–14 season, Ream played in the left–back position and center–back, where he established his partnership with Matt Mills and redeemed himself in the first team making 42 appearances. At the end of that season, he was voted the fans' player of the year and the club’s player of the year.

Ahead of the 2014–15 season, on July 6, 2014, Ream signed a new three-year contract with Bolton that lasts until the summer of 2017. Over the course of the season, he made a total of 44 appearances, missing two matches, one as an unused substitute against Derby County on September 27, 2014 and one through injury. For the second season in a row, he was named as Bolton's player of the year.

Ahead of the 2015–16 season, Ream was linked with a move to Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers, who made a bid for him. However, the bid was rejected.

On August 20, 2015, Ream was sold to Fulham, with whom he signed a four-year deal. The move was undisclosed fee and has an option to extend his stay by a further year.

He made his Fulham debut on August 29, 2015, in a 3–1 win over Rotherham United, playing 90 minutes. He made 29 appearances for the club in his first season, partly due to international commitment and injuries. After initially playing as a center-back, he was used in the left-back position towards the end of the season, following the departure of James Husband. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 loss against Queens Park Rangers on October 1, 2016.

On November 11, 2010, Ream was called up to the United States men's national soccer team for the first time as part of an 18-man roster for a match against South Africa on November 17 in Cape Town. He made his international debut against South Africa on November 17, 2010. He started the match and played until the 67th minute before being replaced by Nat Borchers. The U.S. won 1–0 with the lone goal coming from fellow Red Bull teammate Juan Agudelo. On January 22, 2011, he earned his second international cap against Chile in a 1–1 draw. He played all 90 minutes at center-back.

Ream started in their first game of the 2011 Gold Cup, a 2–0 win over Canada. He also started the second match against Panama, which the U.S. lost 2–1 for their first ever loss in Gold Cup group play. In the 34th minute, he committed a foul on Blas Pérez resulting in a penalty kick for Panama. The penalty was converted by Gabriel Gómez and became the match-winner. In the next match, against Guadeloupe, he was replaced by Eric Lichaj and did not play in the final four matches of the 2011 Gold Cup.

After a two-year absence, Ream was again called into the U.S. national team in 2013 appearing as an unused substitute against Bosnia and Herzegovina on August 14, 2013. On September 3, 2014, he played his first international match in three years, playing 45 minutes in a 1–0 win over Czech Republic.

Ream also was called up for the 2015 Gold Cup where he played all 90 minutes against the Haiti national team and helped preserve a 1–0 clean sheet. He scored his first international goal on May 22, 2016, in a friendly against Puerto Rico at the Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

In January 2012, Ream married his childhood sweetheart Kristen Sapienza, who is also a soccer player. Twenty-four hours after getting married Ream canceled his honeymoon planned in Tahiti to undergo a move to Bolton Wanderers. Ream later stated in The Bolton News interview that he still made a right choice in canceling his honeymoon.

André Schürrle

André Horst Schürrle (; born 6 November 1990) is a German professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Fulham, on loan from Borussia Dortmund, and the German national team.

He began his career at Mainz 05 in 2009, spending two years at the club before a £6.5 million transfer to Bayer 04 Leverkusen. His performances there gained the attention of Chelsea, who signed him for a reported £18 million in 2013. Schürrle played one-and-a-half Premier League seasons at the English club before joining VfL Wolfsburg for £22 million in January 2015, winning the DFB-Pokal and DFL-Supercup in his first year.

Schürrle has been a full international for Germany since 2010, gaining over 50 caps and scoring 20 goals. He was a member of the German squads which reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 2012 and won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. During extra-time in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final he provided the assist for Mario Götze's winning goal against Argentina.

Schürrle started his career at local club Ludwigshafener SC at age four, before joining 1. FSV Mainz 05 in 2006. He played as a defender before switching to his current position of an attacker. He spent three years playing for the club's youth teams, where he won the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2009 under coach Thomas Tuchel.

In August 2009, Schürrle made his Bundesliga debut in a 2–2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen on the opening day of the 2009–10 season. The following month, on 19 September 2009, Schürrle scored his first two league goals in a 3–2 away win against VfL Bochum before signing a professional contract with the club later in the week.

In September 2010, Mainz announced that Schürrle had signed a five-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen, and would join the club at the end of the 2010–11 season. The transfer fee agreed between the two clubs was believed to be in the region of €8 million.

Schürrle completed his £6.5 million move to Bayer Leverkusen in 2011, signing a five-year contract with the club until the summer of 2016. He scored on his debut in a DFB Pokal tie against Dynamo Dresden. He had to wait until 15 October 2011 to open his Bundesliga account for Bayer Leverkusen, when he netted a late equalizer against Borussia Mönchengladbach, rescuing his side a point as the match finished 2–2. Schürrle registered his first European goal in the Champions League in a home win over Valencia four days later.

On 26 September, Schürrle scored his first goal of the season against FC Augsburg in a 3–1 win. In the fixture against Bayern Munich on 28 October 2012, Schürrle provided an assist for Stefan Kießling in a 2–1 win at the Allianz Arena. This gave Bayern their first loss of the season in the Bundesliga and gave Bayer Leverkusen their first victory in Munich since October 1989. On 30 March 2013, Schürrle scored twice in the match against Fortuna Düsseldorf, in a 4–1 win. On 20 April 2013, Schürrle scored a brace and made an assist as they defeated 1899 Hoffenheim 5–0 at home. Schürrle finished the 2012–13 campaign with a tally of 14 goals and 9 assists in 43 games across all competitions.

On 18 April 2013, it was confirmed that Bayer Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Völler had travelled to London to hold talks with Chelsea over the transfer of Schürrle, although no fee had yet been agreed. On 13 June 2013, Chelsea confirmed via their official website that they had reached an agreement with Leverkusen for the transfer of Schürrle, with the transfer fee reported to be in the region of €21 million (£18 million). On 25 June 2013, Chelsea announced that they had completed the transfer of Schürrle, bringing an end to the Londoners' protracted pursuit of the German forward. With Schürrle signing a five-year contract, he was given the number 14 shirt. On 4 August, Schürrle scored his first goal in a Chelsea shirt in a pre-season friendly match against Milan during a tour of the United States.

On 18 August, Schürrle made his competitive debut for Chelsea, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute for Kevin De Bruyne in a Premier League 2–0 win over Hull City at Stamford Bridge. His first goal for Chelsea came in the 2–1 home victory over title challengers Manchester City on 27 October, where he scored from a cross by teammate Fernando Torres. On 7 December, he then scored two goals against Stoke City in a 3–2 defeat.

Schürrle scored his first Premier League hat-trick the following 1 March, against Fulham in a 3–1 away victory in the West London derby. Three weeks later, he assisted Samuel Eto'o's goal in the fifth minute and sent Chelsea into a 2–0 lead in the seventh minute at home to Arsenal; he was awarded Man of the match after Chelsea won 6–0. On 8 April, he scored in Chelsea's second leg UEFA Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain, to advance to the semi-finals on the away-goals rule. His first season in England ended with eight goals in 30 Premier League matches.

On 18 August 2014, in Chelsea's first game of the new league season, Schürrle scored the second goal of a 3–1 victory away to Burnley, from a Cesc Fàbregas pass. This was later voted "Match of the Day"s goal of the month. Chelsea finished the season as Premier League champions and Schürrle, despite going on to complete a transfer to Wolfsburg in early 2015, received a medal, having played 14 matches in the league season. He was not aware that he had played enough matches to earn a medal, and was surprised when manager José Mourinho texted him to tell him of the recognition.

On 2 February 2015, Schürrle returned to the Bundesliga, joining Wolfsburg for a fee of £22 million. Five days later he made his debut for the club, playing the entirety of a 3–0 home win over Hoffenheim and setting up goals for Bas Dost and Kevin De Bruyne.

On 1 March 2016, exactly two years after scoring his first club hat-trick for Chelsea, Schürrle recorded his first treble for Wolfsburg in their 4–0 win against Hannover 96. A week later he scored the only goal in a 1–0 (4–2 aggregate) win over Belgian side Gent to advance his team to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in their history.

On 22 July 2016, Schürrle joined Borussia Dortmund for an undisclosed fee. On 14 August 2016, Schürrle made his debut coming off the bench in 2–0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the DFL-Supercup.

On 25 July 2018, Fulham announced the signing of Schürrle on a two season loan. On 26 August, Schürrle scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 victory over Burnley.

Schürrle made his debut in a UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualifying match against Luxembourg, which resulted in a 3–0 win. After impressing for 1. FSV Mainz 05 in the Bundesliga he was called up to the under-21 team in 2009.

In November 2010, Schürrle received a call up to the senior team. He subsequently made his debut in a friendly against Sweden, appearing as a substitute in the 79th minute. Schürrle and Mario Götze, who came on simultaneously, were the first two German international players to be born in reunified Germany. On 29 May 2011, Schürrle scored his first goal for the senior team, during a friendly against Uruguay in a 2–1 win.

Schürrle was chosen in Germany's squad for their qualification for UEFA Euro 2012. He scored against Azerbaijan in a 3–1 win, on 7 June 2011. On 2 September 2011, he scored again in the 6–2 thrashing victory over Austria, in both cases coming on as a substitute. In the next qualification fixture against Belgium on 11 October 2011, Schürrle was rewarded with his first start in the Euro 2012 qualifiers, and scored in the 33rd minute chipping over Simon Mignolet. After scoring three times during the campaign as Germany won ten out of ten games to top their group in their qualifiers, Schürrle was named in the Germany 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and was given the number nine shirt. He made his first appearance at Euro 2012 on 17 June, coming on as a substitute in the 64th minute for Lukas Podolski, in the 2–1 win over Denmark.

On 15 October 2013, Schürrle scored a hat-trick in a 5–3 away win against Sweden in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.

In the 2–1 victory over Algeria in the round of 16, Schürrle came on for Götze as a half-time substitute and scored the opening goal of the match in the second minute of extra time. On 8 July, he scored Germany's final two goals after replacing Miroslav Klose as a 58th-minute substitute in a 7–1 semi-final victory over Brazil. Schürrle again came on as a substitute in the final against Argentina, replacing the injured Christoph Kramer in the first half. He provided the cross for Götze's winning goal in the 113th minute, as Germany won its fourth World Cup.

During qualification for UEFA Euro 2016, Schürrle scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 away win over Gibraltar on 13 June 2015.

Schürrle usually plays as a winger but naturally positioned as a second striker. One of Schürrle's "key assets" is his "long-distance sprinting on the counter-attack." Schürrle also has an excellent fitness level, work-rate and pace. Schürrle is considered to be a "good finisher" and "capable of executing counter-attacks effectively". He often likes to cut inside, shoot from distance and enjoys time on the ball.

Schürrle was born in Ludwigshafen, Rhineland-Palatinate to Luise and Joachim Schürrle. When he was a youngster, he told in an interview with German football magazine "11 Freunde" that his idols were Michael Ballack and Raúl. He is dating Kazakh-born model Anna Sharypova whom he first met in January 2017.

Håvard Nordtveit

Håvard Nordtveit (born 21 June 1990) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Fulham and the Norway national team.

Nordtveit began his career as a youth in Norway with Vats 94 and Skjold. On 20 August 2006 he became the youngest player ever to play for Haugesund, as he was selected for the starting line-up in a 2–0 victory against Sogndal at Haugesund Stadium. He made nine league appearances during the following season for Haugesund in the Norwegian First Division. That season he also appeared in the Norwegian Football Cup, being in the starting line up in the 1–6 victory against Djerv 1919 (1st round), and coming on in the 33rd minute in a 4–0 victory over Løv-Ham scoring one goal (third round). Haugesund went all the way to the final.

Arsène Wenger travelled to Norway on 11 June 2007 to watch an Adeccoligaen match and begin negotiations to sign Nordtveit. The members of the FKH board stated that the club had rejected Arsenal's initial bid. The player himself said that his club was asking for a "supernaturally high" transfer fee. The price being quoted in the Norwegian media was 20 million Norwegian kroner (approximately £1.7 million at the time). A transfer fee was later finalized on 3 July 2007 for £500,000 initially, rising to £2m after 40 first team appearances.
He was thereafter given the shirt number 55 by the club.

Haugesund captain Kevin Nicol and former Norway coach Nils Johan Semb went on to praise him as the brightest defensive talent in Europe.

He made his Arsenal debut in their first pre-season friendly against Barnet on 14 July 2007.
Nordtveit came on after half-time, replacing Kerrea Gilbert. He was named captain of Arsenal's reserve squad for the first match of the 2007–08 FA Premier Reserve League season. In an interview with Arsenal.com, Nordtveit said he was "honoured" to have been named captain, and that he hoped to continue in that role in the future.

In the final game of the 2007–08 season he was named on the substitutes' bench in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Sunderland.

On 18 August 2008, Salamanca of the Segunda División signed him on a six-month loan.
At Salamanca he played alongside another young Arsenal player, Pedro Botelho. He came off the bench to make his debut for UD Salamanca as they drew 1-1 with Sevilla Atlético in the second fixture of the season.

Arsenal recalled him on 29 October, after becoming unhappy with the amount of playing time the Norwegian had received. However, he was not eligible to play for the club until 1 January 2009. On 21 January, he finally made his first appearance for the reserves since spending time on-loan at UD Salamanca, in a 2–2 draw against the Stoke City reserves. 

On 10 March 2009, Norwegian Premier League outfit Lillestrøm signed Nordtveit on loan until 1 August 2009. He made his debut in the Norwegian Premier League in Lillestrøm's season opener away against Stabæk as a right fullback.
This was a role which he retained during his time with the Norwegian side.

On 28 July 2009, 1. FC Nürnberg agreed a one-year loan deal for the Norwegian defender from Arsenal. Despite being a centre-back, his primary role at Nürnberg was in the defensive midfield position.

On 30 December 2010, Nordtveit joined Borussia Mönchengladbach on a three-and-a-half-year contract, the transfer fee was £800,000. He made his competitive debut for the club on 15 January 2011 in their Bundesliga match against Nürnberg. Nordtveit scored his first goal in Germany, against 1. FC Köln in a 5–1 victory for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
He was used mostly as a defensive midfielder, and established himself as a key player for Gladbach, taking the departed Michael Bradley's place in the squad.

On 16 May 2016, it was announced that Nordtveit would be joining West Ham United on 1 July 2016 on a five-year contract. He made his official debut for the "Hammers" on 28 July in a 2–1 defeat to NK Domžale in the first leg of a Europa League qualifying match, playing the full 90 minutes.

On 20 June 2017, West Ham announced that Nordtveit had signed for German side 1899 Hoffenheim, for an undisclosed fee.

On 31 January 2019, Nordtveit join Fulham on loan until 30 June 2019.
Nordtveit was a regular for the Norway U-17 in qualifying and they barely missed out on a place at the 2007 European Championships. After that he was promoted to the U-19 squad and was ever-present during the 2009 European Championship qualifying, scoring twice, but once again Norway did not make it past the elite qualification stage. He has been a regular for the U-21 team in the 2011 European Championship qualifying campaign. He made his first international appearance on 7 June 2011, in a friendly game against Lithuania. Nordtveit scored his first goal for the national team when he scored Norway's first goal in the friendly match against Northern Ireland on 29 February 2012, which Norway won 3–0. Nordtveit later became a regular in the senior squad, but in October 2012 he was suspended from playing the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Cyprus due to yellow cards. Nordtveit was instead called up for the under-21 side where he played an important role in the 5–3 win against France U21 when Norway qualified for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

He made his debut on 5 August as the season began with a 1–0 loss at Wolverhampton Wanderers, and scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw away to Fulham on 23 September.

On 31 January 2018, Christie joined Championship side Fulham for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for Fulham in a 1–1 draw at Bristol City on 21 February 2018. At the end of the season, Fulham were promoted to the Premier League.

Christie scored his first goal for Fulham in an EFL Cup tie against Millwall on 25 September 2018.

Born in England, Christie was eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother from Dublin. In October 2014, Ireland manager Martin O'Neill reached out to Christie over representing the Republic of Ireland having been impressed with his performances for Derby at the beginning of the 2013–14 season following his move from Coventry. On 10 November, Christie was called into the Ireland squad for a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Scotland, and a friendly against the United States.

On 18 November 2014, Christie made his international debut for Ireland against the United States, in a 4–1 win at the Aviva Stadium, with O'Neill praising his performance. He scored his first international goal on his next cap, a 4–0 away win over Gibraltar on 4 September 2015 which was his competitive debut in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. That 8 October, he played in a victory over world champions Germany in another qualifier, and was praised for his contributions.

Christie scored an own goal on 14 November 2017 as the Irish lost 5–1 at home to Denmark in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying play-off. He was subsequently the target of online racist abuse, which the Football Association of Ireland reported to the police.

Joe Bryan

Joseph Edward Bryan (born 17 September 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Premier League side Fulham. He is also capable as a left-sided midfielder and left-sided wing-back. He has also had loan spells with Bath City and Plymouth Argyle. A product of Bristol City's youth academy, consistently excellent performances on the pitch have led to Bryan being hailed as one of the academy's best success stories.

Bryan was born and raised in the area of Bristol. He came through his local team's youth levels; signing his first professional contract in 2011, agreeing terms to be a Bristol City player for at least two years.

On 24 November 2011, Bryan joined Conference National side Bath City on a two-month loan deal, effectively lasting until January. He scored in a 3–1 win over A.F.C. Telford United.

He made his professional debut for Bristol on 6 March 2012, in a 3–2 win over Leicester City at Ashton Gate. In March 2013, he joined Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the season.

He returned to Bristol City at the end of the season having played on the left side of midfield in ten consecutive games for Argyle. Bryan scored his first goal for City in the Bristol derby with Rovers in September, and his first league goal for the club came in November against Crawley Town. In June 2015 he signed a contract extension keeping him at Bristol City until 2019. The 2016–17 campaign saw Joe Bryan become statistically the best left back in the division. 

Bryan starred in City's 2017–18 EFL Cup run to the semi finals, scoring the third goal in a 4–1 win against Premier League side Crystal Palace and then going on to score the first goal in the club's 2–1 win against Manchester United in the 2017–2018 EFL Cup quarter final at Ashton Gate.

On 9 August 2018, Bryan signed for newly-promoted Premier League club Fulham for a reported transfer fee reported to be in the region of £6 million. He scored his first goal for Fulham in an EFL Cup tie against Millwall on 25 September 2018.

Jean Michaël Seri

Jean Michaël Seri (born 19 July 1991) is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Fulham and the Ivorian national team.

In his native Ivory Coast, the young Seri was nicknamed "Galla", because he tried to emulate the former Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marcelo Gallardo, whose technical skills he admired. Seri joined the Ivorian football academy that was opened in 2001 by the Ivorian footballer Cyril Domoraud. "Jean is gifted, intelligent and respectful," Domoraud said in retrospect. "In his young days, he was one step ahead of the others, thanks to his ball control."
Born in the south-western city of Grand-Béréby, Seri began his career as a youth player with Abidjan club Africa Sports d'Abidjan in July 2007. The best clubs in Ivory Coast fought for his services. In January 2010, Seri started his career as a senior player by joining ASEC Mimosas, the most successful club in Ivorian football, where he needed just one season to prove himself and become one of the best players in the country. "He is a great listener, and his state of mind is impeccable," raved Sébastien Desabre, ASEC Mimosas's head coach from October 2010 to October 2012 when Seri was a senior player there, and that quality enabled Seri to make steady progress.

On 2 November 2012, Seri joined Primeira Liga club FC Porto on loan, after impressing their scouts. However, there was no place for Seri in the club's first team. He was thus forced to play for the club's reserve team, scoring once in 19 Segunda Liga matches in the first five months of 2013.

On 31 August 2013, two months after finishing his loan spell at Porto (the "Dragões"), Seri joined another Primeira Liga club Paços de Ferreira on a permanent basis and on a free transfer by signing a three-year deal. He debuted for the "Pacenses" on 14 September 2013 against Benfica in a Primeira Liga 3–1 away loss. On 2 March 2014, he scored a goal in the 54th minute to register his first competitive goal for Paços de Ferreira in a 3–1 Primeira Liga home win over Marítimo to send his side away from the relegation zone. It was at Paços de Ferreira where Seri's magnificent range of passing and ability to dictate the tempo of the game made him a fans' favourite. The club finished in eighth place in the 2014–15 Primeira Liga, and Ligue 1 club Nice were quick to sign Seri before bigger clubs took notice.

On 11 June 2015, Seri officially joined Ligue 1 club Nice for a transfer fee of €1 million. On 27 May 2015, prior to the opening of the transfer window, the club had announced the "very likely" arrival of Seri. On 8 August 2015, Seri made his competitive debut for Nice in their opening match of the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season, playing the entire match in the 2–1 home loss to Monaco. On 27 September 2015, he scored in the 53rd minute to register his first competitive goal for Nice in a 4–1 Ligue 1 away win over Saint-Étienne.

In July 2018, Seri joined Fulham on a four-year deal until 2022 with an option for Fulham to extend the contract by a further year.

Seri made a total of three appearances for the Ivory Coast U-23 team, all of them at the 2011 CAF U-23 Championship held in Morocco, playing every minute of all their three Group B matches against South Africa, Egypt and Gabon. Ivory Coast finished third in Group B and thus did not qualify for the semifinals.

On 27 February 2014, Seri received his first senior international call up for the Ivory Coast in an upcoming friendly match against Belgium; he was an unused substitute in "The Elephants"' 2–2 away draw (held on 5 March 2014) against Belgium. On 6 September 2015, Seri made his senior international debut in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against Sierra Leone, playing the entire match in the 0–0 away draw. Seri played two of Ivory Coast's three 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Group C matches. They finished third in Group C and thus did not qualify for the quarterfinals. On 17 November 2015, Seri scored a goal in the 64th minute of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification second round second leg 3–0 home win over Liberia to register his first senior international goal.

Sergio Rico

Sergio Rico González (; born 1 September 1993) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for English club Fulham on loan from Sevilla FC as a goalkeeper.

He began his career at Sevilla, where he twice won the Europa League.

Rico made his senior international debut for Spain in 2016, and was chosen for the year's European Championship.

Rico was born in Seville, Andalusia. He played youth football with Sevilla FC, spending several of his first seasons as a senior with the reserves, in Segunda División B. On 1 July 2013, he signed a new two-year deal with the club.

On 14 September 2014, profiting from the injuries of both Beto and Mariano Barbosa, Rico made his first-team – and La Liga – debut, starting in a 2–0 home win against Getafe CF. He first appeared in the UEFA Europa League four days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a home success over Feyenoord for the same scoreline.

In December 2014, Rico was definitely promoted to the main squad, overtaking Barbosa in the pecking order. He extended his contract with the "Rojiblancos" on the 16th, signing until 2017 and being awarded a place with the first team in the following campaign. He finished the campaign with 37 appearances all competitions comprised, including 11 in the Europa League which concluded with a 3–2 win over FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the final.

In 2015–16, Rico played in Sevilla's UEFA Champions League group stage elimination, but was replaced by fellow youth graduate David Soria as the team went on to win a third consecutive Europa League title. He was still first-choice during 2017–18, but was also involved in altercations with manager Vincenzo Montella and a group of supporters.

On 9 August 2018, Rico was loaned to Fulham for one season. He made his Premier League debut on 27 October, in a 0–3 home loss against AFC Bournemouth.

On 26 May 2015, Rico and Sevilla teammate Aleix Vidal were the two players called up to the Spanish national team for the first time, ahead of a friendly with Costa Rica and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Belarus, but he did not play in either fixture. He was the third-choice goalkeeper for the final tournament behind Iker Casillas and David de Gea, and made his debut on 1 June, replacing the former for the final 14 minutes of a 6–1 friendly win over South Korea in Salzburg.

In December 2016, Rico was given the Sport award at the Young Andalusia Prizes, receiving his honour from regional president Susana Díaz, a fan of city rivals Real Betis.

Alfie Mawson

Alfie Robert John Mawson (born 19 January 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre back for club Fulham.

He started his senior career with Brentford from the youth ranks but spent his entire time on loan with four different clubs, including three separate loan spells with Maidenhead United and winning the League Two Player of the Year award with Wycombe Wanderers in 2015. He was transferred to Barnsley after failing to record a League appearance with Brentford, and made 49 appearances during the one season there, helping the former to win promotion to the Championship. He signed for Premier League club Swansea City in 2016, and his second season there he featured in every Premier League match of the campaign but could not prevent the team from relegation.

Mawson has made six appearances for the England under-21 team and was called up for the England squad in March 2018 but did not play in the two friendlies.

Mawson was born and raised in Hillingdon, London.

A centre back, Mawson joined the Reading academy at the age of nine. He remained with the club until his release at age 15 and subsequently had unsuccessful trials with AFC Bournemouth and Millwall.

Mawson joined Brentford in the summer of 2010 on a two-year scholarship. He played for the youth team during the 2010–11 season and progressed into the Development Squad during the 2011–12 season, making nine appearances. He also took over the youth team captaincy during the latter part of the season. In April 2012, Mawson signed a two-year professional contract at Brentford. He was included in the squad for the Bees' pre-season tour of Germany in July 2012 and appeared in the opening match against ZFC Meuselwitz. Mawson suffered an injury-hit 2012–13 season and managed only 12 Development Squad appearances.

Mawson made his professional debut in a 5–0 League Cup second round defeat at Derby County in August 2013, replacing Sam Saunders after 73 minutes. He scored his first goal of the 2013–14 season with the opener in a 1–1 Professional Development League 2 South draw with Brighton & Hove Albion on 16 September 2013. He scored his second goal in a 4–1 defeat to Ipswich Town on 26 November and his third in the return fixture against Brighton & Hove Albion on 27 January 2014. Mawson made 12 appearances and scored three goals for the Development Squad during the 2013–14 season, in addition to making one first-team appearance. A torn meniscus in a Development Squad match ended Mawson's season early, prompting him to contemplate quitting football, before signing a new one-year deal on 5 June 2014. Mawson spent the entire 2014–15 season away on loan and after excelling, he was offered a new two-year contract in April 2015. He turned the deal down and departed Griffin Park when his contract expired on 30 June. An undisclosed compensation fee was agreed in February 2016.

Mawson signed for Conference South club Maidenhead United on 13 December 2012 on a one-month loan, earning praise from manager Johnson Hippolyte for his performance on his debut in a 1–0 win against Truro City. Mawson returned to Brentford on 9 January 2013, before re-signing for Maidenhead United on loan for the rest of the season on 21 February. He made nine appearances during the 2012–13 season as Maidenhead narrowly avoided relegation. Mawson rejoined Maidenhead United for a third loan spell on 4 October 2013, which ran initially until 29 October and was later extended until 4 January 2014. Mawson was recalled from his loan early on 28 November after four appearances.

On 28 November 2013, Mawson moved on loan to Conference Premier club Luton Town until 4 January 2014, to cover for injuries to defenders Steve McNulty, Andy Parry, Alex Lacey and Anthony Charles. He made his debut in a 5–0 away league victory over Alfreton Town on 7 December, but was substituted for Joe Davis at half time due to an injury. He returned to Brentford on 10 January after making just one appearance.

On 31 January 2014, Mawson joined Conference Premier club Welling United on loan until the end of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut with a start in a 1–1 draw away to Tamworth on 22 February. Mawson scored his first Wings goal on his second appearance, heading home the second in a 2–0 home win over Gateshead on 25 February. A knee injury disrupted Mawson's time at Welling and he returned to Brentford at the end of the season, having made 9 appearances and scored one goal.

Mawson joined League Two club Wycombe Wanderers on 9 August 2014 on a one-month youth loan, as cover for the injured Gary Doherty. He made his Wycombe debut (the first Football League appearance of his career) on the opening day of the 2014–15 season, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–0 away win over Newport County alongside former Brentford teammate Aaron Pierre at centre back. After appearing in each of Wycombe's first six matches of the season, Mawson's loan was extended until 1 January 2015. Mawson's 100% appearance record came to an end on his 19th appearance of the season, after suffering an injury in a 3–1 defeat to Burton Albion on 17 November. He returned to action on 29 November against Hartlepool United and capped Wycombe's afternoon with the first Football League goal of his career in a 3–1 victory. His performance won him a place in the Football League Team of the Week.

On 3 January 2015, Mawson's loan was extended until the end of the season, including the play-offs if required, with no recall clause. Mawson's three goals in four matches in March helped ensure Wycombe held onto the third automatic promotion place. He scored a vital winning goal in Wycombe's 2–1 victory over Cheltenham Town on 11 April, to end a run of successive defeats, which kept Wycombe four points clear of fourth-place Bury. Mawson's performance was recognised with his second inclusion of the season in the Football League Team of the Week. Mawson's 97th-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Northampton Town on the final day was not enough to prevent Wycombe from having to settle for fourth place and a play-off semi-final matchup versus Plymouth Argyle. However, his season ended in disappointment after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Southend United in the final. He finished the 2014–15 season with 50 appearances and seven goals. Mawson swept the board at Wycombe's end-of-season awards ceremony, winning the Supporters' and Players' Player of the Year awards, in addition to the Official Wycombe Wanderers Supporters Association's Player, Young Player and Away Travel Player of the Year awards. He also won the Wycombe Wanderers Independent Supporters' Club Player of the Year award. He finished third in the running for the League Two Player of the Year award.

Mawson signed for League One club Barnsley on 30 June 2015 on a three-year contract. He scored his first goal for the Reds in a 3–2 away win over Millwall. He impressed in the 2015–16 season, scoring seven goals in 58 appearances. He played a big part in Barnsley's season, including beating Oxford United 3–2 to win the Football League Trophy on 3 April 2016, and in earning promotion to the Championship after beating Millwall 3–1 in the play-off final.

After just four league matches experience in the Championship with Barnsley, Mawson signed for Premier League club Swansea City on 30 August 2016 on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his full debut on 22 October 2016 in the 0–0 home draw against Watford in the Premier League after which he presented with the man of the match award for his work in defence. He scored his first goal for the club on 3 January 2017 in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace.

In the 2017–18 season, Mawson scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win against Liverpool on 22 January 2018 to help Swansea's survival hopes. Despite this, the club struggled, particularly on the attacking point of view, and despite the player featured in all 38 Premier League fixtures, he did not prevent the club's relegation, which was confirmed on the final day of the season.

After Swansea's relegation from the Premier League, Mawson signed for newly promoted club Fulham on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of £20 million.

Mawson played six times and scored one goal for the England national under-21 team from 2016 to 2017, scoring his only goal on 19 June 2017 in a 2–1 win against Slovakia at the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. England were eventually knocked out by Germany in the semi-final.

On 15 March 2018, Mawson was named for the first time in the England squad for pre-2018 FIFA World Cup friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March.

Lazar Marković

Lazar Marković (, ; born 2 March 1994) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Fulham and the Serbia national team.

He started his career at Partizan before moving to Benfica in 2013, where he won a domestic treble in his only season, after which he completed a £20 million move to Liverpool. His second season at Liverpool was spent on loan at Fenerbahçe, and finished prematurely due to injury. He was then transferred to Sporting CP on a season-long loan, which was cancelled in January 2017, after which he was loaned to Hull City. In January 2019 he moved to Fulham on a free transfer after not making a competitive appearance for Liverpool since May 2015.

Marković made his full international debut for Serbia in 2012.

After playing for the youth selections of Borac Čačak, Marković joined Partizan in 2006 as a 12-year-old trainee. On 29 May 2011, coach Aleksandar Stanojević promoted Marković to the first team ahead of the final round of the 2010–11 SuperLiga, which Partizan played against Sloboda Užice. He was given the number 50 shirt. Marković was used as a second-half substitute for Joseph Kizito in his team's 2–1 win.

On 11 July 2011, together with Nikola Ninković, Marković signed his first professional contract with Partizan, for five years. Marković made his first appearance of the 2011–12 season in Partizan's opener against Shkëndija, in the qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, playing the last three minutes of the match. He scored his first senior goal in a league match against Novi Pazar, on 13 August 2011. At the end of 2011, Marković was voted Partizan's Player of the Year in a poll on the club's website. In his first full senior season, Marković made 26 league appearances and scored six goals. Despite not scoring a goal in the second half of the championship, Marković earned 2011–12 SuperLiga Team of the Year selection.

As Partizan appeared in the group stage of an UEFA competition for the first time since 2010, Marković appeared in all group fixtures, impressing against the likes of Neftchi Baku, Rubin Kazan and Internazionale. In the group stage, he assisted Saša Marković against Rubin Kazan on 6 December 2012. By the end of the 2012–13 season, Marković appeared in 19 league games and scored 7 goals and earned a place in the SuperLiga's Team of the Year selection for the second-straight season. Additionally, Serbian sports portal "Mozzart Sport" rated Marković among the 25 best players in the SuperLiga that season.

On the morning hours of 10 June 2013, Partizan club president Dragan Đurić told "Sportski žurnal", "Chelsea wants to loan Marković to Benfica for two years, and honestly speaking, I hope to God that they don't come to an agreement so that Lazar can stay six more months at Partizan." This statement was later misinterpreted by several non-Serbian sports news outlets, which incorrectly cited Đurić stating, "It is true, Chelsea will send Marković on a loan for two years." Approximately eight hours after the article was published, Benfica's official website released a statement stating Marković had signed a five-year contract with the club, not mentioning any loan deal with Chelsea. The earlier statements regarding a potential loan deal with Chelsea caused great confusion among journalists and followers of the transfer saga alike.

On 25 August 2013, Marković made his debut for Benfica in 2–1 win against Gil Vicente, scoring a decisive goal at the 92nd minute that drew the game. On the third matchday of the 2013–14 Primeira Liga season, against Sporting CP at the Estádio José Alvalade, Marković scored the equalizing goal after a dribble past three players, as the match ended in a 1–1 draw. On 1 May 2014, in injury time of Benfica's 2013–14 UEFA Europa League semi-final second leg match against Juventus, Marković was sent off for a fight with his opponent Mirko Vučinić. Neither were on the field of play at the time, Marković having been substituted and Vučinić still on the substitutes' bench. Marković therefore missed the final through suspension; Benfica lost the final to Sevilla on penalties (4–2) after a 0–0 draw.

On 15 July 2014, Liverpool announced the signing of Marković from Benfica for £20 million. Benfica received €12.5 million for their 50% share of his economic rights. He made his competitive debut on 25 August in Liverpool's second match of the 2014–15 Premier League season, replacing Philippe Coutinho after 60 minutes of a 3–1 defeat at Manchester City. In Liverpool's final group stage match in the UEFA Champions League, on 9 December 2014 against Basel, Marković was shown a straight red card for violent conduct after he appeared to flick his fingers into the face of opponent Behrang Safari. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, which saw Liverpool drop into the UEFA Europa League. In February 2015, Marković was given a four-match European ban for this incident.

Marković scored his first goal for Liverpool against AFC Bournemouth in the League Cup quarter-finals on 17 December 2014, scoring in the 27th minute of a 3–1 victory. On 10 January 2015, he scored his first Premier League goal, netting in the eight minute for the only goal in a victory at Sunderland's Stadium of Light. On 10 February, he opened the scoring for Liverpool in a 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur, his first Premier League goal at Anfield.

On 30 August 2015, Marković joined Fenerbahçe on a season-long loan. He made his Süper Lig debut on 13 September, replacing Robin van Persie in the 62nd minute of a 1–0 win at Kasımpaşa, and scored his first goal on 10 December by opening a 1–1 draw against Celtic at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. The result advanced the "Yellow Canaries" to the last 32 of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League.

On 21 January 2016, Marković scored his first goal in domestic Turkish football against Tuzlaspor in the group stage of the 2015–16 Turkish Cup, converting in extra time after coming on as a substitute. His season ended prematurely in February because of a hamstring injury.

On 31 August 2016, Marković returned to Lisbon to join Benfica's local rivals Sporting CP on a season-long loan. He made his debut on 10 September, replacing Gelson Martins for the final 30 minutes of a 3–0 home win over Moreirense, and scored his first goal three weeks later on his first start to open a 3–3 draw at Vitória de Guimarães.

In January 2017, Marković was recalled from his loan in Portugal and joined Premier League club Hull City for the remainder of the season. He made his first Hull appearance as a 59th-minute substitute for Jarrod Bowen in a 2–1 win over Manchester United in the 2016–17 EFL Cup semi-final second leg, as the "Tigers" lost 3–2 on aggregate. He scored his first goal for Hull by equalising in a 4–2 win at the KCOM Stadium against Middlesbrough on 5 April.

In January 2018, Marković again moved out on loan joining Belgian First Division A side R.S.C. Anderlecht for the second half of the 2017–18 season. It was admitted that upon Marković's arrival his fitness and condition was so poor that he would miss up to six weeks of game time in order to get up to standard.

On 31 January 2019, Marković moved to Fulham on a free transfer; having only made a handful of pre-season appearances for Liverpool, since a competitive 84th-minute substitute appearance against Queens Park Rangers on 2 May 2015.

In October 2009, Marković made his Serbia national under-17 debut in the qualification round for the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. In May 2011, he was part of the same team at the 2011 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, which Serbia hosted.

Marković skipped the national under-19 selection and was immediately invited to the Serbian under-21 team for their qualification matches for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He made his debut against Denmark on 11 October 2011.

On 24 February 2012, Marković was called up to the Serbian senior team for their friendly fixtures against Armenia and Cyprus. He debuted as a starter against Armenia on 28 February 2012, three days before his 18th birthday. He scored his first international goal for Serbia in a friendly match against Chile.

Marković's older brother, Filip, is also a footballer. An attacking midfielder, he too came through Partizan's youth setup and currently plays in France for Lens.

Fabricio Agosto Ramírez

Fabricio Agosto Ramírez (; born 31 December 1987), known simply as Fabricio or Fabri , is a Spanish footballer who plays for Premier League club Fulham as a goalkeeper.

He appeared in 55 La Liga matches during five seasons, representing Deportivo (two spells) Valladolid and Betis in the competition. He also competed professionally in Turkey and England, winning the Süper Lig championship with Beşiktaş in 2016–17.

Fabricio was born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands. After being bought at almost 18 from local UD Vecindario, he finished his football formation at Deportivo de La Coruña. After suspensions to goalkeeping teammates Dudu Aouate and Gustavo Munúa due to a post-training punching session, he was made first-choice, and made his La Liga debut on 13 January 2008 in a 3–4 away loss against Villarreal CF; in February both offenders were reinstated in the first team, and he returned to the B-squad.

In January 2008, Arsenal reportedly showed interest in signing Fabri, considered "one of Spain's brightest talents". During the 2008–09 season he was definitely promoted to backup duties as Munúa and Aouate were both deemed surplus to requirements, and also appeared in the Copa del Rey; however, after the Israeli's move to RCD Mallorca, Munúa was again reinstated as second-choice and Fabricio returned to the reserves.
On 13 July 2009, Fabricio was released by "Depor", joining Real Valladolid on a 2+2 contract. On 19 August of the following year he signed for Recreativo de Huelva in division two, on a one-year loan deal.

Fabri returned to the top flight for the 2011–12 campaign, moving to Real Betis. He featured in 17 overall contests in his first year, keeping clean sheets against Real Zaragoza (2–0, away), Málaga CF (2–0, also away) and CA Osasuna (1–0 at the "Estadio Benito Villamarín"). however, following a run-in with manager Pepe Mel, he was demoted to third-choice and eventually left the club in the 2013 summer, returning to Deportivo.

Fabricio played second-fiddle to Germán Lux in his first year in his second spell in Galicia, but subsequently became the starter. He lost the vast majority of 2015–16, however, due to a tibia injury he originally contracted ten years ago (in 2011, whilst at Betis, he also suffered a potentially career-threatening shoulder ailment).

In July 2016, Fabri moved abroad for the first time, signing for Turkish Süper Lig champions Beşiktaş JK. In a 0–6 loss at FC Dynamo Kyiv in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 6 December, he began to cry after conceding the fourth goal of the first half.

In his first season in Istanbul, Fabricio only missed two matches in 34 as his team were crowned champions for the second consecutive time and 15th overall.

On 24 July 2018, Fabri joined Premier League club Fulham on a three-year deal with the option of a fourth year. He was already known to their goalkeeping coach José Sambade Carreira, with the pair having worked together at Deportivo. His first appearance in the Premier League took place on 11 August, in a 0–2 home defeat against Crystal Palace.

A former youth international for Spain, in February 2018 Fabri announced that he was of Uruguayan descent and wanted to represent its national team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Rui Fonte

Rui Pedro da Rocha Fonte (born 23 April 1990) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward or a right winger for French club Lille OSC on loan from Fulham.

After signing for Arsenal as a 16-year-old, he only made one competitive appearance for the club before signing with Sporting, who loaned him several times for the duration of his contract, including at Espanyol who acquired him permanently in 2011. He subsequently joined Benfica, where injury problems saw him feature sparingly until his release; with his next team, Braga, he notably won the 2016 Portuguese Cup.

All youth levels comprised, Fonte earned 69 caps for Portugal, scoring 26 goals.

Fonte was born in Lisbon, and joined Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth system at only nine. In 2006 he signed a three-year contract with Arsenal, with a clause stating he was to return to his previous club if the English did not extend the contract beyond the original period.

A regular member of Arsenal's reserves, Fonte made his debut for the first team in a friendly against Barnet in the 2008 pre-season. He made his competitive debut for the Gunners as a substitute for Carlos Vela in a League Cup match against Wigan Athletic on 11 November 2008, a 3–0 home win.

On 30 January 2009, Fonte signed for Championship side Crystal Palace on a one-month loan, with his older brother José playing a big role in persuading club and player of each other's merits. He made his debut for his new team in a 0–1 home defeat to Blackpool on the following day, and his loan was subsequently extended until the end of the season; Palace were docked a point and fined £20,000 for fielding him in their final match, despite his loan having expired.

On 19 May 2009, it was announced that Arsenal had decided not to extend Fonte's three-year contract, and the player returned to Sporting. He spent the 2009–10 campaign on loan to Vitória de Setúbal, making his Primeira Liga debut on 17 August in a 0–0 home draw against Vitória de Guimarães (one minute played) and appearing sparingly during the campaign as the former barely escaped relegation.

Fonte played 2010–11 on loan to RCD Espanyol, in Spain. He spent the vast majority of his spell with the reserves, his first La Liga appearances consisting of one minute in a 1–0 home win over Sporting de Gijón on 5 December 2010, and ten in a 0–1 loss to Real Madrid also at the "Estadi Cornellà-El Prat", two months later.

On 14 July 2011, Fonte signed permanently for Espanyol for two years. On 17 January of the following year he scored his first official goal for the "Pericos", in a 3–2 home win against CD Mirandés for the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey– he also netted in the second leg, albeit in a 1–2 and 4–4 aggregate loss; in between he scored his first goal in the league, closing the scoresheet in a 3–0 home success over Granada CF.

On 29 January 2013, Fonte terminated his contract with Espanyol and, on the next day, signed with S.L. Benfica on a five-and-a-half-year contract. He was initially assigned to the B-team in the Segunda Liga, suffering a knee injury in his debut against C.F. União and being sidelined for the rest of the campaign.

In January 2015, Jorge Jesus confirmed that Fonte was promoted to Benfica's first team after the loan of Nélson Oliveira. His first competitive appearance took place on the 14th, as he played the first half of the 4–0 home win against F.C. Arouca for the third round of the Taça da Liga.

On 2 February 2015, Fonte, at the time second level top scorer for Benfica B with 17 goals in 21 matches, was loaned to C.F. Os Belenenses, until the end of the season. For 2015–16, in the same predicament, he joined S.C. Braga also in the top level.

On 16 December 2015, after having replaced Wilson Eduardo for the last 11 minutes of regulation time, Fonte scored the 4–3 winner for the hosts against Sporting, helping oust his former club from the Taça de Portugal. The following 22 May, after being injured for nearly three months, he started in the final of the domestic cup, netting in a 2–2 draw against FC Porto (4–2 penalty shootout win).

On 1 September 2016, Fonte signed a three-year contract with Braga. He scored 11 goals during the campaign (15 overall), helping to a fifth-place finish.

On 17 August 2017, Fonte transferred to Championship club Fulham after agreeing to a three-year contract. He scored in his second league appearance, a 2–0 away win over Ipswich Town.

On 31 August 2018, Fonte joined Lille OSC from France on a season-long loan, reuniting with his older brother José Fonte.

Fonte made his debut for the Portugal under-21s against Spain on 18 November 2008, scoring the first goal in a 4–1 victory. He was called up to the full side for the first time on 31 March 2015 for a friendly with Cape Verde, remaining on the bench in the 0–2 defeat in Estoril.

Fonte's older brother, José, is also a footballer – a defender, he played most of his professional career in England, and the two were teammates at Sporting (youth), Crystal Palace and Lille.

Their father, Artur, played 12 seasons in the Portuguese top division.

Aboubakar Kamara

Aboubakar Kamara (born 7 March 1995) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for Süper Lig club Yeni Malatyaspor, on loan from Premier League club Fulham.

Kamara made his Ligue 1 debut for Monaco on 12 September 2014 against Olympique Lyonnais in a 2–1 away defeat. He replaced Yannick Carrasco after 84 minutes. On July 2015, Kamara signed a three-year contract with Belgian Pro League side K.V. Kortrijk, but returned to France only six months later, joining Championnat National side Amiens and helping the club to achieve back-to-back promotions up to Ligue 1. Kamara scored the first goal of a dramatic 2-1 win against Stade de Reims in the last matchday, with Amiens clinching promotion after retaking the lead in the 6th minute of the stoppage time. Kamara ended the season as the club's top goalscorer at the 2016–17 Ligue 2 with 10 goals.

On 31 July 2017, Kamara signed for Fulham for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract with an option for another 12 months. He chose to wear the number 47 so that his initials and number would match AK-47. On 23 September, Kamara scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Middlesbrough, and three days later, he scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win over Nottingham Forest. On 31 October, he was sent off for shoving Bailey Wright off the ball, as Fulham lost 2–0 to Bristol City. He later scored consecutive braces for Fulham in a 2–2 draw with Hull City and in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town. On 20 January 2018, he scored the final goal in a 6–0 win over Burton Albion. This turned out to be the last goal he scored for Fulham during the 2017–18 season, as he was used sparingly afterwards, with the rest of his appearances coming off the bench.

On 5 December, Kamara scored his first goal of the 2018–19 season in a 1–1 draw against Leicester City, and three days later, he scored a consolation penalty in a 4–1 loss to Manchester United, after coming on at half-time for Aleksandar Mitrović. On 29 December, against Huddersfield Town, Kamara argued with Mitrović over taking a penalty; his effort was saved by Jonas Lössl. Although Fulham won the match, manager Claudio Ranieri was angered by Kamara's decision to take the penalty, stating: "He did not respect me, the club, team-mates and crowd. I spoke with him, it is not right". Mitrović was more forgiving of Kamara, referring to a similar incident he had while playing for Newcastle United. On New Year's Day, Kamara scored against Arsenal, in a eventual 4–1 loss. During January, Kamara had another altercation with Mitrović in a yoga session at the club's training ground, and as a result, was left out of the team squad for Fulham's match against Burnley. Later that month, Kamara was arrested at the club's training ground on suspicion of actual bodily harm and criminal damage, and was "banned indefinitely from all club activities".

Kamara had been training with the under-23 squad, and, on 31 January 2019, joined Yeni Malatyaspor on loan until the end of the season.

Kamara was born in France and is of Mauritanian descent.
