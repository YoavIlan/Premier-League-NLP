Tom Heaton

Thomas David Heaton (born 15 April 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Burnley and the English national team.

He began his professional career with Manchester United but was unable to break into the first team and spent time on loan with Swindon Town, Royal Antwerp, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Rochdale and Wycombe Wanderers, before joining Cardiff permanently after his release by Manchester United in July 2010. He then joined Bristol City on a one-year deal with an option of a second year but turned it down in May 2013 in favour of a move to Burnley, whom he has represented in the Premier League, and captained for since 2015.

Formerly an international from under-16 to under-21 level, Heaton has been involved in senior England squads since 2015, finally making his senior debut against Australia on 27 May 2016 in a UEFA Euro 2016 warm-up fixture.

Born in Chester, Cheshire, Heaton began his football career with Wrexham, for whom he played both in goal and in midfield, but, after making 20 appearances for the Manchester United Under-17 team in the previous two seasons, he signed for United as a trainee on 8 July 2002. He became a regular in the Under-17 team during the 2002–03 season, and picked up an FA Youth Cup winner's medal despite playing second fiddle to Luke Steele throughout the entire competition. He made his first appearance in the reserve team the following season, starting in a 3–1 home win over Birmingham City in the Premier Reserve League on 2 October 2003. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Heaton was named on the bench for the final of the Manchester Senior Cup against Manchester City, and won a winner's medal despite not taking the field.

By the 2004–05 season, Heaton had become the first-choice goalkeeper for the Manchester United reserve team, and was named on the bench for Stan Ternent's testimonial on 17 August 2004, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Luke Steele after Steele had earlier come on for Tim Howard. With Heaton in goal for 17 of the 28 Premier Reserve League North matches and 12 of the 22 Central League matches, the team went on to win both league titles by nine and five points respectively.

Heaton's form for the reserves resulted in him being loaned out to Swindon Town at the start of the 2005–06, initially until 1 January 2006. During his time at Swindon, he played over 20 matches, saving a penalty on his debut, and was described as "one for the future" by manager Iffy Onuora. He returned to Manchester United, but, after the recall of Ritchie Jones from Royal Antwerp, Heaton was sent there for the rest of the season after United rebuffed an approach from Huddersfield Town.

Heaton spent the 2007–08 season with the first team-squad at Manchester United, appearing on the bench when Edwin van der Sar was out due to injury.

At the end of the 2007–08 season, Heaton agreed to move to Championship club Cardiff City on loan for the duration of the 2008–09 season. He was chosen as the club's first choice goalkeeper, above Peter Enckelman, for the start of the season by manager Dave Jones. He played in every match until late November, with the exception of the League Cup third round tie against Swansea City, when he was replaced by Enckelman. However, late on in Cardiff's 2–1 away defeat to Plymouth Argyle on 22 November 2008, Heaton picked up an injury and was forced off. The injury would go on to cost Heaton his place in the team as the club went unbeaten with Enckelman in goal for over two months.

In February, Enckelman was forced to undergo knee surgery which saw Heaton return in goal on 16 February 2009, when he picked up the man of the match award in a 4–0 defeat at the hands of Arsenal. However, he tore his thigh muscle during the match, ruling him out for up to five weeks. On his return, Heaton found himself on the bench behind loanee Stuart Taylor but, following a 6–0 defeat against Preston North End, he replaced Taylor for the final three matches of the season. However, he was unable to keep Cardiff in the play-off places and he returned to Manchester United at the end of the season.

On 15 August 2009, Heaton was signed by Queens Park Rangers on an emergency three-month loan deal, the terms of which allowed him to compete in the League Cup. Heaton's loan spell ended on 8 November 2009. He made one first-team appearance during his loan, in the 1–0 defeat at Chelsea in the League Cup on 23 September 2009.

After returning from QPR, Heaton joined Rochdale on 13 November 2009 until the end of December 2009. He made his debut in a 3–2 loss against Chesterfield on 14 November 2009. The loan was then extended until 23 January 2010, before a further extension pushed the end date back to 31 January. In his 12 appearances for Rochdale, Heaton conceded only ten goals – including four clean sheets – and finished on the losing team just once.

Heaton spent less than two weeks back at Manchester United before going back out on loan to Wycombe Wanderers on 12 February 2010. He went straight into the Wycombe starting line-up for their away match against Brentford the following day, which they drew 1–1. Heaton made his second appearance for the Chairboys in their 0–0 draw against Southampton on Tuesday 23 February 2010. He made a great save from a volley to keep the Chairboys on even terms with the Saints.

Meeting with Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson on his future at the club amidst an expiring contract, Heaton declined an offer to stay at Old Trafford, deciding instead to leave on free transfer in pursuit of regular playing time. Following his release by United, Heaton agreed a deal on 15 June 2010 to return to Cardiff City on 1 July 2010. He made his second debut in 4–1 win over Burton Albion in the League Cup on 11 August. After first-choice goalkeeper David Marshall suffered an elbow injury, Heaton established himself as Cardiff's new number starter. In late February, however, he suffered a groin injury, so Jason Brown and Stephen Bywater were brought in as cover on loan. Upon his return, Heaton went into the team against Derby County, where they won 4–1, their first win in four matches. Heaton's performances during the 2010–11 season earned him the club's Young Player of the Year award.

Under new manager, Malky Mackay, Heaton found himself as cover for David Marshall, but he played a key part in the club's League Cup run in which they reached the final thanks to two saves from Heaton in a semi-final penalty shoot-out against Crystal Palace. He suffered an ankle injury just before the final, but he overcame the injury to start at Wembley Stadium. Heaton followed his penalty heroics against Crystal Palace when he started the penalty shoot-out by pushing Steven Gerrard's effort onto the bar, but he ultimately ended up on the losing team as Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–2. Despite the successful cup run, Heaton still found himself second string to Marshall and was released at the end of the season after rejecting a new contract in the Welsh capital.

In July 2012, Heaton held talks with Watford over a potential move; however, Watford's new owners decided to pull out of the move. Later that month, Heaton went on trial with Bristol City during their pre-season training camp in Spain and they opened contract talks soon after. On 27 July, Heaton signed a one-year deal with the club, with the option for a further 12 months. He made his debut on 18 August 2012, in a 1–0 defeat away to Nottingham Forest. A disappointing season in Bristol led to the club owning the worst defensive record in the league with 84 goals allowed, and they were relegated at the end of the season. Heaton started 43 of Bristol City's 46 matches in the Championship that season, and was viewed as one the club's better players that season.

Heaton joined Burnley in May 2013, after turning down a further one-year deal at Bristol City. His decision was to stay in the Championship, and Burnley offered Heaton a two-year contract attaching him to the club until June 2015, with an option of a third year. A target of manager Sean Dyche while at Watford, Dyche's first Burnley signing was described as a "good technician" with a "great pedigree". Heaton immediately became first-choice goalkeeper for Burnley following the departures of Lee Grant and Brian Jensen. He made his Burnley debut against Bolton Wanderers on 3 August 2013. On 24 August, he was the recipient of a rare technical caution (his second of the match) for handling the ball after releasing it whilst playing against Brighton, a match they lost 2–0. Heaton was a part of Burnley's defence that allowed only 37 goals, the fewest in the league, as Burnley returned to the Premier League for the first time since 2009–10. Heaton also picked up 19 clean sheets, the most by any keeper in the regular season.

Heaton made his Premier League debut on 18 August against Chelsea in a 1–3 loss. Heaton played in every minute of Burnley's Premier League campaign, the only goalkeeper in the league to do so, but his efforts would not be enough, as Burnley and their league-worst offense were relegated at the end of the season. After the season, Heaton was voted by his teammates as Burnley's Players' Player of the Year.

On 30 June 2015, Heaton signed a new three-year deal at the club through to the summer of 2018. Taking over for Jason Shackell, Heaton was named as captain for the 2015–16 season, captaining the team for the first time on 8 August 2015, on the opening day of the 2015–16 Championship season against Leeds United in a 1–1 draw. Heaton kept 20 clean sheets during the season, second only to Dimitrios Konstantopoulos of Middlesbrough, as Burnley did not lose in the second half of the Championship season on their way to becoming champions and earning promotion back to the Premier League at their first attempt. Towards the end of the season, Heaton was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year.

On 20 July 2016, Heaton signed another new contract, this time a four-year deal running until the summer of 2020. On 29 October, Heaton made numerous saves during the match against former club Manchester United, the highlight being a mid-air, fully extended save of Zlatan Ibrahimović that Heaton claimed "nearly broke [his] arm". Afterwards, Heaton required medical attention but remained in the match to lead Burnley to a 0–0 draw, being named Man of the Match in the process. In the same season on 22 January 2017, Heaton made his 150th league appearance for the club as he was beaten by a 97th-minute penalty from Alexis Sánchez that saw Arsenal win 2–1.

Having played for England at various youth levels, Heaton was handed his England under-21 debut in March 2008 by manager Stuart Pearce when he replaced Joe Hart as a substitute during a match against Poland. However, he did not make the final squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

On 21 May 2015, Heaton was called up to the England senior team for the first time ahead of a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia. Heaton continued to be included in Roy Hodgson's squads before finally making his debut as an 87th-minute substitute in place of Fraser Forster in England's Euro 2016 warm-up match against Australia, played at Sunderland's Stadium of Light.

On 16 May 2018, he was one of 5 players named on standby for the 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Matthew Lowton

Matthew John Lowton (born 9 June 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays for Burnley in the Premier League. He can play in a number of defensive positions but is a natural right-back.

Born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, Lowton joined Sheffield United's academy in 2004. He spent time on loan with both non-league Sheffield and Hungarian side Ferencváros before making the break into United's first team in 2010. He played regularly for two seasons before being sold to Aston Villa in 2012. After three seasons and 72 Premier League appearances, he joined Burnley in 2015.

Lowton was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He joined Sheffield United aged fifteen after a spell with Leeds United and progressed through Sheffield United's youth set up to reserve level, converting from a full-back to a central defensive role in the process. After spending a spell on loan at Sheffield FC in 2008, in January 2009, Lowton went out on loan to Sheffield United's Hungarian sister club Ferencváros, along with fellow reserve player Sam Wedgbury, to get first-team experience. He made his debut in the Hungarian League Cup the next month, making eighteen appearances before returning to United towards the end of the season.

Back in the Championship, Lowton found himself on the fringes of the first team and duly made his Blades debut in a 1–1 draw with Cardiff City at the end of March 2010, coming on as a late substitute, before making his full debut for the club in the final match of the season.

The following season, Lowton started Sheffield United's opening day fixture, away to Cardiff City, but was issued with a straight red card. Despite this setback, he returned to the first-team picture and was rewarded with a new contract at the end of September. Lowton continued a run of substitute appearances and rewarded United's faith by scoring his first senior goal in mid-October, netting in a 3–3 home draw with Burnley. Lowton played regularly for the remainder of the season, scoring four goals in all, but couldn't prevent the club from slipping to relegation.

With the Blades in League One at the time, Lowton remained a key player and was rewarded with an extended contract in August 2011, making 55 appearances in total for the Blades during the following season and scoring six goals.

Lowton completed a move to Aston Villa in July 2012 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £3 million, becoming Paul Lambert's second signing as Villa manager, and made his debut on 18 August 2012, in the Premier League against West Ham United. On 15 September, Lowton scored his first league goal for Villa in a 2–0 home win against Swansea City. On 19 July 2013, Lowton signed a new four-year deal to keep him at Aston Villa until the summer of 2017.

On 22 June 2015, Burnley secured the signing of Lowton on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £1 million plus add-ons. Lowton made his debut for Burnley on 20 October, as an 84th-minute substitute against Nottingham Forest; his first start came against Charlton Athletic on 19 December. His first and only goal of the season was Burnley's fourth in a 5–0 rout of Milton Keynes Dons on 12 January 2016. Lowton would make 27 appearances in his maiden season at Burnley, all in the League, as Burnley won the Football League Championship title and earned promotion to the Premier League.

Jack Cork

Jack Frank Porteous Cork (born 25 June 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Burnley and the English national team. He played for the Great Britain Olympic team at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Cork started off his career with Chelsea but between 2006 and 2011, he went on loan to a number of clubs, including Scunthorpe United where he was named player of the year. Without making an appearance for Chelsea, he signed permanently to Championship club Southampton in 2011 where he made over 100 appearances for them and helped them promoted to the Premier League by featuring in all their matches. Cork spent two and a half years with Premier League club Swansea City from January 2015 to July 2017 before his permanent move to Burnley where he featured in every match en route of the club qualifying to the UEFA Europa League.

Cork has featured for England from U16 in 2005 to U21 between 2008 and 2011, the Great Britain Olympic team and once for the senior national team.

Cork was born in Carshalton, London. He is the son of former footballer and manager Alan Cork.

Cork joined the Chelsea youth system up age of nine, and captained both the club's youth and reserve teams. During the 2006–07 season, Cork twice went on loan to League One club AFC Bournemouth. Cork was selected to go on Chelsea's pre-season tour of the United States in summer 2007. He made his first appearance for the first team against Club América on 14 July. He played out-of-position at left back for most of the tour.

Cork spent the 2007–08 season on loan at newly promoted Championship club Scunthorpe United. His first league goals came for Scunthorpe, both against Coventry City; in a 1–1 away draw on 27 November 2007 and in a 2–1 home victory on 1 March 2008. After 35 appearances, despite Scunthorpe's relegation from the Championship, he was voted the club's Player of the Year.

On 21 August 2008, Cork joined Championship club Southampton on loan until 1 January 2009. In January 2009, Cork joined Championship club Watford on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season. He scored his first goal for Watford on 24 January 2009 in a 4–3 victory over Crystal Palace in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Cork signed a new three-year contract with Chelsea on 21 August 2009 and immediately joined Championship club Coventry City on loan until the end of December 2009.

On 1 February 2010, Cork joined Premier League club Burnley on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. He made his first appearance for Burnley in a 3–0 defeat away to Fulham on his Premier League debut. He then played in a 5–2 defeat against Aston Villa on 21 February 2010 and assisted Burnley's second goal. Cork scored his first goal for Burnley on 9 May 2010 in a 4–2 home win over Tottenham Hotspur, with a diving header to score Burnley's second to turn over a two-goal lead. His father revealed the day before in a local newspaper, the "Lancashire Telegraph", that Cork was looking to leave Chelsea in the summer and was willing to drop down into the Championship in order to do so.

On 8 August 2010, Chelsea said that they would allow Cork to leave the club and were looking for offers of around £2 million. On 12 August, Cork re-joined Burnley on loan for the 2010–11 season. Cork scored a last minute winner at home to Derby County on 27 November, taking Burnley into the play-off positions.

On 7 July 2011, Cork signed for newly promoted Championship club Southampton, after they agreed an undisclosed fee with Chelsea. Cork ended the 2011–12 season as the only Southampton player who appeared in every league match, as the club earned promotion to the Premier League as runners-up in the Championship.

Cork missed Southampton's opening fixtures of the 2012–13 Premier League, due to an ankle injury, sustained against Bristol City in a friendly and a League Cup victory over Sheffield Wednesday. On 26 August 2014, he scored his first goal for Southampton in a 2–0 away victory over Millwall in the second round of the League Cup.

He scored his first league goal for the club in a 4–0 home win over Newcastle United on 13 September 2014 and his second and final league goal for the club came in an 8–0 home win over Sunderland on 18 October.

Cork signed for Southampton's Premier League rivals Swansea City on 30 January 2015 on a three-and-a-half-year contract, for a fee "believed to be in the region of £3 million". On 25 April 2015, he scored his first goal for Swansea in a 3–2 away win over Newcastle United.

Over a year after his first goal for the club, on 1 May 2016, he scored his second, with a 20-yard curling shot in a 3–1 home victory over Liverpool. This victory helped secure Swansea's Premier League status for the 2016–17 season.

Cork signed for Premier League club Burnley on 11 July 2017 on a four-year contract, for fee reported to be in the region of £8 million, rising to £10 million with add-ons. He scored his first goal on his return to Burnley in an EFL Cup tie against Blackburn Rovers on 23 August 2017. His first Premier League goal for Burnley came against his former club Swansea City in a 2–0 win on 18 November. That goal ended a run of 43 appearances without a goal for the player. 

On 16 August 2018, he scored the winning goal in Burnley's 1–0 victory over Istanbul Basaksehir in the Europa League qualifiers.

Cork has represented England at many youth levels, making his under-19 debut against the Czech Republic in May 2007. He captained the England U19 squad to make the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, and was part of the under-21 squad at the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

On 2 July 2012, Cork was named in Stuart Pearce's 18-man Great Britain squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He made his debut on 20 July in a 2–0 loss to Brazil in a pre-tournament friendly, coming on at half-time to replace Daniel Sturridge. He played as a substitute in each of Great Britain's three group matches, and was an unused substitute as the team were knocked out by South Korea in the quarter-final.

James Tarkowski

James Alan Tarkowski (born 19 November 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre back for club Burnley and the English national team.

He began his professional career at Oldham Athletic of League One, where he made 89 appearances across all competitions. In January 2014, he moved to Brentford for an undisclosed fee, winning promotion to the Championship in his first season. Two years later he signed for Burnley. He made his debut for England in March 2018, starting in a 1–1 draw against Italy.

Tarkowski was born in Manchester and grew up in New Moston. He attended New Moston Primary School and Failsworth High School, which he left in 2009. 

Tarkowski began his career in the youth system at Blackburn Rovers, before being released at the age of 14 at his own request. After his spell at Blackburn, Tarkowski had a stint playing senior football at Maine Road in the North West Counties League.

He is a Manchester United fan and admired David Beckham and Paul Scholes while growing up.

Tarkowski joined League One club Oldham Athletic on a two-year scholarship in May 2009. He made his reserve-team debut in October 2009. A centre back, Tarkowski was called up to the first team for the first time for a league match versus Plymouth Argyle on 15 January 2011. His senior debut came on 22 January, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for the injured Neal Trotman in a 2–1 home win over Brentford. Tarkowski made his first Latics start in a 1–0 defeat to Leyton Orient on 12 March and played the full 90 minutes. He was awarded a two-year professional contract by the club in May 2011. He made 9 appearances during the second half of the 2010–11 season.

Tarkowski had to wait until 10 December 2011 to make his first appearance of the 2011–12 season, when he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Jean-Yves Mvoto in a 2–0 home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. A half time substitute appearance in Oldham's 2–1 Football League Trophy Northern Area final first leg defeat to Chesterfield on 30 January 2012 kicked off a run which saw Tarkowski included in almost all of Oldham's first-team squads until the end of the season. Tarkowski crowned his run of appearances by scoring his first senior goal for the club on the final day of the season in a 2–1 win over Carlisle United. He made 18 appearances during the 2011–12 season and scored one goal.

Tarkowski began the 2012–13 season as a first-choice centre back alongside Jean-Yves Mvoto and started Oldham's first six games of the season. He scored his first goal of the season in a 2–0 league win over Crewe Alexandra on 2 October 2012. Tarkowski played a part in Oldham's run to the fifth round of the FA Cup, playing in the first round win over Conference Premier team Kidderminster Harriers and starting in the home draw and away replay defeat to Premier League team Everton in the fifth round. He scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 league win over Stevenage on 19 February 2013. Tarkowski made 26 appearances and scored two goals during the 2012–13 season. He signed a new two-year contract in the summer of 2013.

Tarkowski began the 2013–14 season with a bang, scoring Oldham's first goal in a 4–3 away league win over Stevenage on the opening day. He was picked by the Latics supporters as Oldham's Player of the Month for August 2013. Now lining up at centre back alongside Jonathan Grounds, Tarkowski scored his second goal in a 2–1 defeat to Preston North End on 9 September 2013. Tarkowski was an ever-present in Oldham's runs to the Northern Area semi-final of the Football League Trophy and the third round of the FA Cup. He started the FA Cup third round tie against Premier League team Liverpool at Anfield and scored an 82nd minute own goal, which consigned the Latics to a 2–0 defeat. Tarkowski's form saw him offered a new contract extending until the end of the 2016–17 season on 22 January 2014, but he departed Boundary Park 9 days later. During his time with the Latics, Tarkowski made 89 appearances and scored six goals.

Tarkowski signed for League One club Brentford on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 31 January 2014. After a period on the bench, he made his Brentford debut with a start in a 0–0 draw away to Carlisle United on 1 March. He scored his first goal for the club on his third appearance, heading in to send the Bees on their way to a 2–0 victory over Tranmere Rovers on 11 March. Four days later, Tarkowski was sent off for the second time in his career during a 1–0 win over Leyton Orient. Following Brentford's promotion to the Championship on 18 April, Tarkowski scored his second goal for the club in a 2–2 draw at Milton Keynes Dons on 21 April. He finished the 2013–14 season with 13 appearances and two goals.

Tarkowski began his first season at Championship level as an ever-present in the Bees' league matches. He suffered a dip in form in September and early October, stepping up to take his first penalty for the club in a league match versus Leeds United on 27 September and hammering the ball over the bar. He was spared his blushes, with Jota and Alan McCormack on target in the eventual 2–0 win. Tarkowski gave away a penalty in a 2–1 defeat to Watford on 30 September and received his fourth yellow card of the season (his third in four matches). Another yellow card in a 0–0 draw with Wigan Athletic on 18 October saw him incur a suspension and he failed to appear again until 28 December, scoring what proved to be Wolverhampton Wanderers' winner with an own goal in a 2–1 defeat. Despite the blunder, Tarkowski held onto his starting place and scored his first goal of the season against Reading on 25 April 2015, making sure of the points with the second in a 2–0 win. Tarkowski had the opportunity to convert a late penalty to make it two goals in two games in the following match against Wigan Athletic, but his miss made little difference with the Bees already 3–0 ahead. He appeared in both legs of Brentford's 5–1 playoff semi-final aggregate defeat to Middlesbrough and finished the 2014–15 season with 38 appearances and one goal.

Tarkowski helped salvage a 2–2 draw with Ipswich Town on the opening day of the 2015–16 season, feeding Andre Gray to score in injury time, before bundling home a 96th-minute equaliser to earn a place in the Football League Team of the Week. He suffered a displaced fracture of the nose in the following match versus Bristol City, but kept his place alongside Harlee Dean until suffering a calf injury in a 1–1 draw with Leeds United on 12 September. He missed two matches before being sent off on his return in a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. Amidst a number of transfer bids, Tarkowski was internally disciplined for refusing to play in Brentford's match versus Burnley on 15 January 2016, for which he later apologised. He failed to appear for the Bees again and departed Griffin Park two weeks later, having made 74 appearances and scored four goals in two years with the club.

On 1 February 2016, Tarkowski signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Championship club Burnley for an undisclosed fee. Tarkowski made his club debut on 20 February against Rotherham United, entering as a substitute in the first half for Michael Keane, who was forced off with a head injury. Tarkowski deputised for Keane for the next two games, with Burnley victorious against Nottingham Forest and Bolton Wanderers. However, Keane was preferred by manager Sean Dyche at right centre-back upon his return to fitness as Tarkowski was limited to one substitution appearance the rest of the season. In third position in the table at the time of Tarkowski's signing, Burnley went unbeaten the rest of the season as they won their third ever second-tier title and direct promotion to the Premier League on their first attempt.

Tarkowski was handed the captain's armband for Burnley's 1–0 extra-time defeat to fourth-tier Accrington Stanley in the EFL Cup on 24 August, after Dyche had made 10 changes to the team that upset Liverpool four days prior. Tarkowski made his Premier League debut on 27 August at Chelsea, coming on as a substitute and receiving a booking for a foul in the run-up to Chelsea's final goal in the 3–0 defeat. Unable to crack the preferred centre-back partnership of Keane and Ben Mee, Tarkowski received scant playing time, despite being an ever-present on the bench. He was a halftime substitution on 23 April 2017 against Manchester United for Mee, who left with a shin injury, opening the door for his first Premier League start on 29 April against Crystal Palace. Tarkowski endured being hit by an object thrown by a Palace fan during celebrations of Ashley Barnes' opening goal, as well as keeping Christian Benteke in his back pocket en route to a clean sheet. Manager Dyche lauded his performance as "outstanding". Tarkowski would retain his place in the team for Burnley's final four fixtures, during which Burnley ensured their participation in the next edition.

During the summer transfer window, teammate Michael Keane departed for Everton, allowing Tarkowski to line up with Mee in the center of Burnley's defense on a full-time basis. Assigned the shirt number 26 initially, Tarkowski assumed the number 5 shirt vacated by Keane ahead of the season. Tarkowski's performance against Crystal Palace on 10 September was deemed Man of the Match worthy by Sky Sports, as Tarkowski held Benteke and Palace without a goal. His 17 clearances in the match were the most by anyone in the Premier League that season, besting a mark previously held by himself in Burnley's surprise opening day victory over Chelsea.

Tarkowski was eligible to play for Poland through his grandfather but preferred to play for England, stating "I've always seen myself as an English person so to play for Poland would be difficult," On 15 March 2018, he was named in the England squad for pre-2018 FIFA World Cup friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March. He made his debut on 27 March when starting in the 1–1 draw with Italy at Wembley Stadium.

On 16 May 2018, he was one of 5 players named on standby for Gareth Southgate's 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Tarkowski was reported to have withdrawn from the standby list later for hernia operation.

Ben Mee

Benjamin Thomas Mee (born 21 September 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Burnley.

Starting off with Manchester City, Mee only made one League Cup match for them before being loaned out to Leicester City and Burnley, joining the latter on a permanent basis. He has made over 200 appearances for them since then. He has also featured for the England youth teams from U19 to U21 level.

Mee was born in Sale, Greater Manchester. He first came to prominence for Manchester City as the captain of the City Academy squad which won the 2008 FA Youth Cup. He signed a two-year contract that would keep him at City until 2011.

Mee was given his first real test of first-team experience when he was taken on City's US tour in the summer of 2010, with club manager Roberto Mancini expressing that he wanted to blood his youth players and have a chance to see what they could do at a higher level than reserve fixtures. Mee made up two appearances, against Portland Timbers and New York Red Bulls.

After being given number 41 shirt, Mee followed up his tour appearances with a starting line-up appearance in the League Cup against West Bromwich Albion on 22 September 2010 in a 2–1 away loss. Alongside Mee making his debut, Javan Vidal and John Guidetti were given their first competitive appearances for the club in a match where three of the four players in the defensive line were young Elite Development Squad players and a full six of the starting line-up were aged 21 or younger and had come through the club's academy system.

On New Years Day 2011, Mee joined former Manchester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson's Leicester City side on loan for the rest of the 2010–11 season. After signing for the club, Mee would join his Manchester City's teammate Greg Cunningham at Leicester City. After two weeks yet playing them, Mee finally made his debut for Leicester City in a 4–2 win over Millwall. On 12 March 2011, Mee provided his first professional assist for Miguel Vítor to score his first goal in the match against Scunthorpe United which he scored twice later in the match which Leicester City won 3–0. On 25 April 2011, Mee provided another his second assist for Jeffrey Bruma to score against Watford in a 4–2 win.

After the end of 2010–11 season, Mee returned to Manchester City after 6 months at Leicester City. Following the sacking of Sven Göran Eriksson, Mee commented that he was sad to hear of the news.

On 14 July 2011 it was confirmed that Mee had joined Burnley on a season long loan. Following his move to Burnley on loan, Mee hints that his good performance at Burnley could earn him a chance back at parent club Manchester City next year.

On 19 July 2011, Mee made his debut for Burnley in a pre-season friendly match against before coming off for David Edgar on the 67th minute in a 2–0 loss against League Two side Bristol Rovers. On 6 August 2011, Mee made his league debut for Burnley in a 2–2 draw against Watford and played 90 minutes until the end of the match. On 29 November 2011, Mee got his first clean sheet for Burnley without letting an opponent score, capping a perfect birthday for Burnley manager Eddie Howe in a 4–0 win over Ipswich Town.

On 10 January 2012, Burnley boss Eddie Howe expressed interest in signing Mee on a permanent basis with Manchester City sanctioning a sale just days after signing former Manchester City teammate Kieran Trippier who was also on loan at the club. Mee joined on a permanent three and a half-year deal on 17 January for an undisclosed fee. His move to Burnley has comes as no surprise to find that the club have moved to bring him on board full-time. During a match against Reading in a 1–0 loss on 27 February 2012, Mee made an impressive tremendous clearance by using his head to block a Noel Hunt shot to prevent Reading scoring for a second time. However, his season ended after suffering a slight back fracture which he sustained during a 5–1 win over Portsmouth. In combination of his loan spell and permanent spell at Burnley, Mee finished his season, making thirty-one appearances.

In the 2012–13 season, Mee started his season when he appeared sporadic at the start until he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Millwall on 28 September 2012. However soon after, Mee suffered a knee injury during the Lancashire derby, which kept him out for several weeks. Mee made his return from injury, on 11 March 2013, as Burnley and Hull City both drew 1–1. In the next match, on 17 March 2013, Mee was sent-off after a second bookable offense when Burnley meet Blackburn Rovers meet again, as they both drew 1–1. Soon after that, Mee continued to be sidelined with injuries, including missing out for the rest of the season.

In the 2013–14 season, Mee sustained a knee injury in the pre-season friendly and made a return, though he missed the first four matches, due to being on the bench. From late-December to January, Mee had been absent twice in weeks. Despite the absent, Mee played a vital role as a left-back position, where he helped the club get promoted to Premier League and made thirty-eight appearances.

In the 2014–15 season, Mee started his season well when he signed a three-year contract that will keep him until 2017. Mee made his Premier League in the opening match of the season as a left-back, as Burnley lost 3–1 to Chelsea. Mee scored the late equaliser for Burnley in Stamford Bridge against Chelsea to keep the final score 1–1 and his goal was the second goal of the season Chelsea conceded from a corner kick.

At international level, Mee has represented England at under-21 level, making his debut as a substitute in a friendly against Germany.

Ashley Barnes

Ashley Luke Barnes (born 30 October 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Burnley.

Barnes previously played for Paulton Rovers, Plymouth Argyle, Oxford United, Salisbury City, Eastbourne Borough, Torquay United and Brighton & Hove Albion. He has been capped by Austria at international level, making one appearance for their under-20 team.

As a child, Barnes played on a team called Bath Arsenal, where his teammates included fellow future professional Scott Sinclair. He began his senior career as a prolific goalscorer with local club Paulton Rovers of the Southern League. He had an extended trial with Championship club Plymouth Argyle in March 2007, and sufficiently impressed to be awarded with an eighteen-month contract by the club, having scored several goals for the reserve team. He made his Plymouth debut in the first round of the League Cup in August 2007 against Wycombe Wanderers, coming on as a substitute for first-team regular Sylvan Ebanks-Blake.

He subsequently found first-team opportunities hard to come by, and was sent on loan to Conference side Oxford United in November 2007 to gain some experience. Barnes featured five times for Oxford United, including two FA Cup ties against Southend United, before returning to Plymouth. He was sent out on loan again in March 2008 to another Conference club, this time to Salisbury City. He featured in five league matches for the club but did not find the back of the net.

Barnes was loaned out for a third time in November 2008 to Eastbourne Borough, with teammate Daniel Smith. He impressed enough for his loan to be extended by a month, before he was recalled by Plymouth Argyle in January 2009, ahead of the club's match against Bristol City. He made his league debut for the Pilgrims against Wolves at Molineux, scoring his first goal for the club against Coventry City. His performances at the back-end of the 2008–09 season were rewarded when he signed a two-year contract extension in May 2009.

He joined League Two club Torquay United on loan until the end of the season in February 2010, but returned a month later having made six appearances.

Barnes subsequently joined League One club Brighton & Hove Albion on loan until the end of the season. He scored on his debut against Tranmere Rovers two days later, having been introduced as a substitute ten minutes earlier.

On 8 July 2010, Barnes signed a two-year contract with Brighton & Hove Albion after transferring for an undisclosed fee from Plymouth Argyle. On 12 April 2011, he scored the decisive goal in a 4–3 win at home against Dagenham & Redbridge, which confirmed their promotion to the Championship. Barnes finished the season as Brighton's second-top goalscorer behind Glenn Murray, with 20 goals in 49 appearances.

In the 2011–12 season Barnes remained a first-choice striker for Brighton's return to the Championship. He finished the season as Brighton's leading goalscorer with 14 goals in all competitions, 11 in the league.

On 9 March 2013, Barnes received a red card in stoppage time against Bolton Wanderers for attempting to trip up the referee. He was subsequently handed a seven-match suspension by the Football Association. Fans and manager Gus Poyet were critical of Barnes for this action as it left the club with only one senior striker available to play, as Craig Mackail-Smith and Will Hoskins were already injured for the rest of the season. On his return from the ban on 20 April, Barnes scored two goals in a 6–1 win over Blackpool and was named man of the match.

On 10 January 2014, Barnes joined Burnley for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal. On 8 November, he scored the only goal at Turf Moor to defeat Hull City and gain Burnley's first win of the Premier League season. He scored a second goal on 13 December, the sole goal in a home victory over Southampton to take Burnley out of the relegation zone.

In February 2015, Barnes performed a high tackle on Chelsea's Nemanja Matić, who was sent off for pushing him in retaliation. Barnes did not receive a booking for the challenge, and The FA confirmed that they would not take retrospective action as that was not normal procedure for attempted tackles. Barnes was publicly criticised by Chelsea manager José Mourinho, and said of the criticism "I found that hilarious".

On 24 May 2015, as relegated Burnley finished the season with a win over Aston Villa, Barnes was taken off with knee cruciate ligament injuries, which would rule him out for the majority of the following campaign.

On 3 March 2018, he wrote himself into the history books, scoring his 16th goal in the Premier League to secure a 2–1 victory for Burnley against Everton. His 16th goal, and his 6th of the season, made him Burnley's leading scorer in the Premier League since it was formed in 1992.

Born in Bath to English parents, Barnes would qualify to represent Austria courtesy of his paternal grandmother, who was from Klagenfurt if he were to acquire Austrian citizenship. He was spotted by Austrian officials while on a pre-season tour with Plymouth Argyle in July 2008, and as a result he was called up to their Under-20 team to face Switzerland on 19 August 2008, the match was part of a four nation friendly tournament featuring Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.
Barnes made his debut as a substitute in the 73rd minute replacing FC Wacker Innsbruck's Julius Perstaller in front of 250 spectators. 

Barnes said in April 2015 that he had had no further contact with the Austrian Football Association, and stated that he was open to representing either England or Austria at senior level if given the opportunity. In March 2017, whilst playing in the Premier League for Burnley, he expressed his desire to represent the national senior side. His form in the 2017–18 season led to calls in Austria for him to receive a national team call-up, and manager Franco Foda confirmed in March 2018 that he was monitoring Barnes.

Barnes is from Dunkerton, Somerset, near Bath. He attended Writhlington School, near Bath.

Robbie Brady

Robert Brady (born 14 January 1992) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a winger and a left-back for Premier League club Burnley and the Republic of Ireland national team.

Brady began his career in the Manchester United academy. However, after featuring just once for United's first team, he joined Hull City initially on loan and then permanently in 2013. He made 124 appearances for the "Tigers", helping them reach the 2014 FA Cup Final. In July 2015, he joined Norwich City for £7 million where he suffered relegation to the Championship with the club in 2016. He returned to the Premier League where he became Burnley's record signing in January 2017 when he completed a transfer for a fee reported to be around £13 million.

Brady has represented Ireland at all youth levels. After becoming their highest under-21 scorer of all time with seven goals, Brady made his senior international debut against Oman in 2012, scoring and setting up two more goals in a 4–1 victory. He has earned over 30 caps for his country and represented them at UEFA Euro 2016, scoring two goals during the tournament.

Born in Baldoyle, Dublin, Brady attended Pobalscoil Neasáin and was part of their under-16 All-Ireland Championship winning team. He was spotted by Manchester United scouts while playing for St. Kevin's Boys, and joined the club's academy shortly after his 16th birthday in January 2008. He made his first appearance for Manchester United in an under-18s match against Liverpool on 19 January 2008. His reserve team debut came just two months later, in a 3–1 win over Newcastle United.

In July 2008, Brady signed on as an academy scholar, and cemented his place in the under-18s throughout the following two seasons, as well as playing for the reserves. In the 2010–11 season, Brady graduated to the reserve team on a permanent basis. He was named as an unused substitute for the first team's League Cup Fourth Round win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 26 October 2010. He made his only appearance for Manchester United on 26 September 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for Alexander Büttner in a 2–1 victory over Newcastle United in the third round of the League Cup.

On 19 July 2011, Manchester United loaned Brady to Championship club Hull City until 31 December. He made his debut in the first match of the season on 5 August 2011 at the KC Stadium in a 1–0 defeat to Blackpool. Three weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal for the "Tigers" in a 1–0 win against Reading at the KC Stadium. The loan was extended until the end of the 2011–12 season on 5 January 2012. On 21 January, Brady scored in a 1–0 win against Reading at the Madejski Stadium.

On 5 November 2012, Manchester United loaned Brady to Hull until 2 January 2013. He came off the bench the following day against Wolverhampton Wanderers as a replacement for Liam Rosenior. Brady scored his first goal since returning to Hull on 8 December 2012 against Watford; he scored with a 25-yard free kick that went in off the crossbar, making it 2–0 to Hull.

On 8 January 2013, Brady was signed by Hull on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee.

Brady scored a first-half penalty in Hull's opening home Premier League match on 24 August 2013, giving them a 1–0 win against Norwich City. He went on to score two more goals in the Premier League the following month. He then underwent two separate groin operations which made him miss most of the rest of the season.

Brady scored three goals during the 2014–15 campaign including two goals in the second leg of the Europa League play-off round tie against Belgian Pro League side K.S.C. Lokeren on 28 August. Hull won 2–1 on the night but lost the tie on the away goals rule. There was to be more disappointment for Brady as Hull were relegated after finishing the season in 18th position, three points behind Aston Villa.

On 29 July 2015, Brady joined newly promoted side Norwich City on a three-year deal, for a reported fee of £7 million. He netted his first league goal in a Norwich City shirt on 26 September 2015, opening the scoring in a 2–2 draw against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. On 1 March 2016, Brady lost two teeth in a clash of heads with teammate Gary O'Neil in a Premier League match against Chelsea. Norwich ended the season in 19th place which meant back-to-back relegations for Brady.

Brady opened his 2016–17 goalscoring account on 1 October 2016 with a stunning 25-yard strike in the 2–1 away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. He doubled his goal tally for the season on 5 November, opening the scoring in a 3–2 home defeat to Leeds United. On 31 December, Brady was sent off in the 0–0 draw at Brentford in a controversial decision with manager Alex Neil saying: "Robbie clearly isn't going in to injure the lad and both of them are sliding at impact, but we're not getting the rub of the green right now and that's just another example." Norwich appealed the red card shown to Brady but it was rejected, meaning the Irishman would miss the next three matches. He returned to the side for a 1–0 defeat by Southampton in the FA Cup on 18 January 2017 and scored a penalty in the following league match, a 3–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 28 January, he made his final appearance for Norwich in a 2–0 win over Birmingham City, registering an assist for a Timm Klose goal just before half-time.

On 31 January 2017, the final day of the January transfer window in England, Brady completed a move to Premier League club Burnley in a club record deal reportedly worth £13 million, meaning he would link up with his longtime friend Jeff Hendrick and international teammate Stephen Ward. He signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the option of another year. Four days later, he made his Burnley debut as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 away defeat to Watford. Eight days after that, on 12 February, he scored his first Burnley goal, a 20-yard free kick, on his full debut for the club in a 1–1 home draw against league leaders Chelsea. In the following match on 25 February, Brady provided an assist for Michael Keane's equalising goal in the 1–1 draw away to Hull City, his former club.

In September 2010, Brady made his under-21 debut in the Cornaredo Stadium in Lugano. On 9 August 2011, Brady scored two goals in a 2–1 win for Republic of Ireland U21s in a friendly match against Austria U21s. He also scored in the 2013 European Championship qualifiers against Hungary and Liechtenstein.

On 26 February 2012, Brady was named 2011 Under-21 International Player of the Year for his terrific performances throughout the year. In September 2012, he became the record goalscorer at Irish under-21 level with his seventh goal for his country.

On 8 September 2012, Brady received his first senior international call-up for a friendly against Oman. He scored and set up two more goals in a 4–1 victory over the Arab opponents. On 18 November 2014, he scored his first brace for Ireland against the United States. On 29 March 2015, Brady started at left-back in Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland at the Aviva Stadium in a match that finished 1–1. On 13 November 2015, Brady scored in the 82nd minute of the crucial Euro 2016 play-off first leg match against Bosnia and Herzegovina to earn a 1–1 draw. Three days later, he assisted one of Jonathan Walters' two goals to earn Ireland a 2–0 victory and qualification to UEFA Euro 2016.

On 22 June 2016, Brady scored a crucial header against Italy in the 85th minute of Ireland's last Euro 2016 group stage match resulting in a 1–0 victory, which enabled Ireland to progress to the knockout stage of the competition as one of the best-performing third-placed teams. He also scored a penalty in Ireland's 2–1 defeat to the host nation, France, as "The Boys in Green" exited the tournament in the Round of 16 stage.

On 28 March 2017, Brady captained Ireland for the first time in a 1–0 defeat friendly international defeat against Iceland at the Aviva Stadium.

Brady is in a relationship with choreographer Kerrie Harris, who runs a dance school called Soul2Sole Dance Academy in her native Swords, Dublin. They have one child together, a daughter named Halle. His younger brother, Gareth, has played internationally for Ireland at under-17 level. His other brother, Liam, also appeared for Ireland at under-18 level.

Jeffrey Patrick Hendrick (born 31 January 1992) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Burnley and the Republic of Ireland national team.

Hendrick spent his early years with boyhood club St. Kevin's Boys in his native Dublin. He had a number of unsuccessful trials in England before joining Derby County's youth academy in 2008. Hendrick made his professional debut in April 2011 after impressive performances with the reserve team led manager Nigel Clough to include him in the senior setup. He quickly became a regular starter and appeared in the 2014 Championship play-off final where Derby missed out on promotion with a 1–0 loss to Queens Park Rangers. Hendrick amassed a total of 214 appearances for Derby over seven seasons. He joined newly promoted Premier League side Burnley in August 2016, signing a three-year deal.

Hendrick has represented Ireland at all youth levels. Since his senior international debut in 2013, he has made over 40 appearances for Ireland and represented them at UEFA Euro 2016.

Hendrick joined Derby County as a youth player in 2008 from St Kevin's Boys in Dublin, having overcome Osgood-Schlatter disease, and played regularly for the club's academy side before breaking into the reserve team during the 2009–10 campaign. He made one start and seven substitute appearances as the club's reserve side successfully captured the 2009–10 Central League Central Section title. At the end of the season his first involvement with the Derby County first team came on 2 May 2010 as he was an unused substitute in a 2–0 victory over Cardiff City in the final match of the 2009–10 season. A few weeks later, on 8 July 2010, he signed his first professional contract, alongside four other Derby County academy graduates, including fellow Republic of Ireland Youth international Ryan Connolly and future League of Ireland player Graham Kelly.

Hendrick played a more significant role in Derby's reserve side during the 2010–11 season, making 17 starts in all competitions and scoring 9 goals, including a hat-trick in a 14–1 victory over Shirebrook Town in the Derbyshire Senior Cup and a brace in a 5–0 win over Buxton in the final of the same competition. Throughout the campaign, Hendrick impressed enough to earn a contract extension at Derby, which he signed in January 2011 to take him through until Summer 2012.

Approaching the end of the 2010–11 campaign, Derby manager Nigel Clough stated his desire to give Hendrick a run in the first team, stating "(He's) progressed and done well this season...we would love to see him in the team for three or four games." Hendrick made his debut in the following match on 23 April 2011, as an 80th-minute replacement for Robbie Savage in a 4–2 home defeat to Burnley.

Ahead of the 2011–12 season, manager Nigel Clough stated that Hendrick would feature in the Derby County first team squad more often.<ref name="11/12"></ref> He was allocated the squad number of 23. Despite missing the majority of Derby's pre-season due to his call-up to the European under-19 tournament, Hendrick was involved in first team duty from the start of the campaign, making substitute appearances in the season's opening two matches, against Birmingham City and Watford. He then claimed a place in the starting line-up from the third match (a 1–0 win at Blackpool) onward. He scored his first professional goal in his fifth start of the season, claiming the winner in a 2–1 victory at local rivals Nottingham Forest. His performance earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week and his rich vein of form followed into the next match, a 3–0 thumping of Millwall, in which Hendrick grabbed his first goal at Pride Park and secured a second consecutive Team of the Week place.

Hendrick's form saw him linked with switches to Premier League duo Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion. The speculation saw Derby enter into contract talks with the midfielder over a new four-year deal. However, his form tailed off badly (as did Derby's) over the subsequent six weeks, culminating in his substitution in a 2–0 home defeat to Hull City on 19 November 2011, the first time in his young career he had been removed from a match early after being in the starting eleven, with Clough suggesting that the contract talks and Hendrick getting "people" had had a negative effect on his game. The following month, the Dublin native signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract, extending his stay at the Pride Park club until the summer of 2015.

Hendrick missed Derby's Christmas and New Year programme of fixtures with an ankle ligament injury in a 1–0 defeat against Ipswich Town. Hendrick returned to the first team squad as an unused substitute in a 1–0 win against Coventry City on 14 January 2012, returning to playing action a week later in the 0–0 draw at Burnley as a 47th-minute substitute. He started every match for the remainder of the season after this fixture, displacing James Bailey in central midfield. He scored his third goal of the season in a 3–2 home win against Crystal Palace on 24 March. Hendrick's form throughout the season was rewarded when he won the club's Sammy Crooks Young Player of the Year award.

Hendrick started the 2012–13 season in the starting eleven but after poor performances and scoring only once in his first 17 matches, he was dropped for Michael Jacobs. However, he regained his place shortly after due to an injury picked up by Craig Bryson after admitting his poor performances in mid-December. Hendrick's form improved and he scored his second goal of the season in a 2–0 win at Bristol City on 15 December 2012. Hendrick started 2013 in good form, scoring three goals in the opening three matches, including a goal against Middlesbrough in a 3–1 home win which was later named Derby's "Goal of the Season". Former Derby teammate Kevin Kilbane stated that Hendrick had the ability to play in the Premier League. He scored again on 9 February 2013, in a 2–2 draw against Sheffield Wednesday. He earned further praise for his performance in Derby's 3–0 win at home to Bristol City on 29 March, where he scored the opening goal. Hendrick finished the season runner-up for the Derby County Player of the Season Award and named the 58th best player in the 2012–13 Football League Championship by the Actim Index.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Hendrick was set to compete with Craig Bryson, Paul Coutts and Will Hughes for a starting berth, with Nigel Clough stating that rotation could be utilised. Hendrick started in Derby's first five matches, before succumbing to a chipped ankle bone injury in the 3–0 win at Yeovil Town in late August, with a scan revealing damage worse than expected and was later ruled out for 12 weeks.

Hendrick scored four league goals during the 2013–14 season, helping Derby reach the play-offs. In the play-off semi-final, Derby came up against Brighton & Hove Albion. On 11 May 2014, Hendrick scored in the 4–1 home victory in the second leg as Brighton were defeated 6–2 on aggregate. On 24 May, he played in the play-off final as Derby lost 1–0 to Queens Park Rangers thereby missing out on promotion to the Premier League.

On 26 June 2014, Hendrick agreed a new four-year contract with Derby, which would keep him at the club until the end of the 2017–18 season. The 2014–15 season was his most fruitful to date in terms of goalscoring as he netted a total of nine goals in 47 matches in all competitions.

Hendrick scored his first goal of the 2015–16 season in a 2–2 draw away at Leeds United on 29 December. He scored his second of the season in the 3–1 away win against Brentford on 20 February 2016. After missing seven league matches due to a thigh injury, Hendrick returned for the final league match against Ipswich on 7 May but was an unused substitute. Derby finished in fifth place in the Championship and qualified for the play-offs where they would meet Hull City in the semi-final. Hendrick was again an unused substitute in the semi-final first leg but returned to the starting line-up for the second leg and played the full 90 minutes as Derby lost 3–2 on aggregate to the "Tigers".

Hendrick's 2016–17 season did not get off to a good start as he picked up a hamstring injury in a 2–0 loss to Barnsley on 13 August.

On 31 August 2016, Hendrick joined Premier League side Burnley for a club record £10.5 million fee on a three-year deal. He made his debut on 10 September, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw at home to Hull City. He made his first start for Burnley on 17 September, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 away defeat against reigning Premier League champions Leicester City. Nine days later, Hendrick netted his first goal for Burnley in a 2–0 home win over Watford with a header from a Steven Defour cross. He scored his second goal for his new club on 10 December 2016 with a 25-yard volley in a 3–2 home victory over Bournemouth. Hendrick's strike was nominated for Goal of the Month; it came third in the public vote, behind strikes by Alexis Sánchez in second and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in first. On 4 February 2017, he was sent off against Watford in the sixth minute for a two-footed challenge on José Holebas as Burnley were defeated 2–1 at Vicarage Road.

Hendrick opened his 2017–18 goalscoring account on 1 October away at Everton, finishing off a move that consisted of 24 passes. Burnley would go on to win 1–0. He netted his second goal of the season in a 1–0 home victory over Newcastle United on 30 October in what was Sean Dyche's fifth anniversary as Burnley manager. Hendrick had a goal ruled out for offside and was denied a clear penalty in the 0–0 draw at Huddersfield Town on 30 December. Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lössl later admitted he made contact with Hendrick; "I touched him. I spoke to the referee and I said there was contact. I didn't do it on purpose, but there was contact. I told the referee after but it was his decision."

Burnley finished seventh in the 2017–18 Premier League and qualified for the second qualifying round of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League.

On 20 June 2018, it was announced that Burnley would face Scottish Premiership club Aberdeen in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League. Hendrick made his Europa League debut when he started on 26 July 2018 at Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen. He was replaced by Sam Vokes in the 67th minute with Vokes eventually going on to score the equaliser to make it 1–1 in the 80th minute. The match ended 1–1, meaning Burnley had the advantage of an away goal.

His first goal of the 2018–19 season came on 26 August in a 4–2 away defeat against newly promoted Fulham.

Born in Dublin, Hendrick has been capped by Ireland at under-15, under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels. He was shortlisted for the Republic of Ireland under-17 level International Player of the Year award in July 2010. He played a key role in the U19s successful 2011 European Under-19 Championship qualifying campaign putting in a "string of impressive displays" as he featured in all three group matches and notched the only goal of the match in a 1–0 win over Poland U19s. In July 2011, Hendrick was named in the squad for the European Under-19 Championships. He started in all four of Ireland's matches at the tournament as they were knocked out in the semi-final stage to Spain.

Upon his return from the tournament, Hendrick was called up to the Irish U21 squad for the first time. He made his debut in a 2–1 victory against Austria U21s on 9 August 2011.

In January 2013, it was reported that Ireland head coach Giovanni Trappatoni was watching Hendrick with the view to giving the player his first call-up to the senior side and later in the month Hendrick was called up to the senior squad to play in a friendly against Poland on 6 February 2013. Hendrick came on as a 71st-minute substitute for James McCarthy in the 2–0 win and provided an assist for Wes Hoolahan for Ireland's second goal in this match, showing fantastic composure in doing so with a perfectly weighted pass. Hendrick received his first Ireland start in his fourth cap, in a match against World and European Champions Spain on 12 June 2013 at the Yankee Stadium in New York City. He played a starring role in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia in the Aviva Stadium on 7 September 2015. His run and nutmeg set up an easy finish for Jonathan Walters which proved to be the only goal of the match.

Hendrick started in all four of Ireland's matches at Euro 2016. He hit the crossbar against Sweden and was unlucky not to score against Italy. He earned much praise for his performances as he played a vital role in securing qualification to the knockout stages of the championship. Ireland eventually lost 2–1 to hosts France in the Round of 16.

Hendrick scored his first goal for Ireland on 5 September 2016. He opened the scoring in the third minute in the 2–2 away draw against Serbia in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match with a low shot just outside the penalty area which was deflected in off Branislav Ivanović.

Hendrick is known for being very hard-working, tactically aware and for his ability to pass the ball successfully. He is capable of playing as a central midfielder or an attacking midfielder behind the striker. His big strength is winning second balls from aerial duels and keeping the attack going in advanced positions. Owing to his lack of proficiency in scoring goals, Hendrick's most frequent task is recycling possession high up the pitch to create chances for his teammates.

Ben Gibson

Benjamin James Gibson (born 15 January 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Burnley.

Having graduated from Middlesbrough's Academy, Gibson enjoyed loan spells with Plymouth Argyle, York City and Tranmere Rovers before breaking into the club's first team in 2013. In 2016, he was part of the Middlesbrough team that secured promotion to the Premier League and the following year earned his first call-up to the English national team.

Gibson was born in Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire and attended Nunthorpe School and Yarm School. His uncle is current Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson.

Gibson joined Middlesbrough's Academy from Marton at the age of 12. He was a member of the Middlesbrough team that won the Nike Cup in 2008 and signed his first professional contract with the club on 1 July 2010. He made his first-team debut as a substitute on 25 April 2011 against Coventry City, coming on in the 41st minute for the injured Andrew Davies, with Middlesbrough going on to win the game 2–1. He finished the 2010–11 season with one appearance for Middlesbrough, and having captained the reserve team to The Football Combination East Division title.

Gibson signed a three-month loan deal with League Two club Plymouth Argyle on 2 August 2011. After making 13 appearances in this time, Gibson and both clubs involved agreed on 1 November 2011 to extend the loan deal until 29 January 2012. However, the loan was cut short after Middlesbrough recalled him on 30 November 2011. He signed for Conference Premier club York City on loan until the end of 2011–12 on 9 February 2012. After a promising start Gibson was sent off in the 1–0 away victory to Cambridge United. However, after missing the next four games through suspension he won the 2012 FA Trophy Final with York at Wembley Stadium on 12 May, in which the team beat Newport County 2–0. Eight days later he played in the 2–1 victory over Luton Town in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley on 20 May 2012, seeing the club return to the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion to League Two. Gibson completed his loan at York with 11 appearances.

On 14 August 2012, Gibson joined League One club Tranmere Rovers on a one-month loan. The month was extended until January 2013 the following month, but in December 2012 was ruled out of action with an abductor problem, thus ending the duration of his first loan spell at Rovers. He signed a new four-year contract with Middlesbrough on 18 December 2012. On 13 March 2013, Gibson returned on loan to Rovers, until the end of the season.

The 2013–14 season saw Gibson become more involved in the first team squad for Middlesbrough; the team did not perform well, and manager Tony Mowbray was sacked in October 2013. Aitor Karanka replaced him, and they finished twelfth. The following season saw the club finish fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. They reached the final at Wembley Stadium, having won 5–1 on aggregate against Brentford, but were defeated 2–0 by Norwich City. In the 2015–16 season, Gibson helped Middlesbrough secure promotion to the Premier League, having finished as runners-up, behind champions Burnley, in the Championship.

Gibson still remained as a crucial part of Middlesbrough's squad in their 2016–17 Premier League campaign, though they did not record positive results; they dropped into relegation zone in March 2017, with Karanka being sacked later that month. Their relegation back down to the Championship was confirmed in May 2017, after a 3–0 defeat to champions Chelsea, with the club having only been in the English top flight for one season.

Gibson signed for Premier League club Burnley on 5 August 2018 on a four-year contract for a joint club-record fee of £15 million.

Gibson has competed for the England under-17s, the under-18s, the under-20s and the under-21s. He was part of the under-17 teams that won the 2009 Nordic Cup, where he scored in the final against Scotland, and the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.

Gibson made his debut for England under-21s in the first leg of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs against Croatia on the back of an impressive campaign for Middlesbrough. His performances made him a key member of the under-21 set up and he formed an effective partnership with John Stones. Gibson scored his first goal for the under-21s in England's final friendly before the European Championships against Belarus. He went on to play 90 minutes in all of England's three group stage matches in the tournament although could not stop their disappointing early departure.

Gibson received his first call-up to the English national team on 24 March 2017, replacing the injured Chris Smalling for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.

Gibson plays at centre back or left back.

Peter Crouch

Peter James Crouch (born 30 January 1981) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for club Burnley. He was capped 42 times by the England national team between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country in that time, and appearing at two World Cups.

Crouch is one of 28 players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals, holding the record for the most headed goals in Premier League history.

Crouch began his career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish club IFK Hässleholm he joined Queens Park Rangers. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, Portsmouth acquired him on a transfer deal worth £1.5 million. He had a strong first season at Fratton Park, and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined Aston Villa in March 2002 for £5 million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to Norwich City in 2003 before making a move to Southampton, where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining Liverpool in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final.

After scoring 42 goals in three seasons at Anfield, Portsmouth re-acquired Crouch for £11 million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international Jermain Defoe. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and Harry Redknapp. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against Manchester City which earned the club a place in the UEFA Champions League. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010–11, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined Stoke City in August 2011, for a club record fee of £10 million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's Player of the Year award. He scored eight in 2012–13 and then hit ten in both the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. Crouch spent seven-and-a-half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019.

Crouch was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, but his family moved to Singapore when he was one year old. His family's move to Singapore came about when his father Bruce, originally from Fulham, took up a job offer to work at a Singaporean advertising agency. The Crouch family spent three years living in the Far East, and moved back to England after Bruce rejected the chance to work in Australia. They then spent time living at a YMCA in Tottenham before settling in Harrow on the Hill. Crouch attended Roxeth Primary and North Ealing Primary and began to play football with Northolt Hotspurs. He was then invited to join the Brentford Centre of Excellence in 1991 and he also played for the boys club West Middlesex Colts whilst attending Drayton Manor High School. Crouch turned down contract offers from Chelsea and Millwall and instead joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 1994. He did not stay at QPR for long, however, for in November 1994, the coaching staff at Loftus Road moved to Tottenham Hotspur, including its youth team manager Des Bulpin, who offered Crouch a contract at Spurs.

Crouch's family were Chelsea supporters and he became a ball boy at Stamford Bridge at the age of ten. As a child, he attended some Chelsea matches. Later, he told the Liverpool official website that despite this, he and his friends at the time were fans of QPR.

Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth team. However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at Dulwich Hamlet in the Isthmian League Premier Division and, in the summer of 2000, IFK Hässleholm in Sweden, where he played in the local fourth-highest division. His move to Sweden came about when IFK Hässleholm sold Jon Jönsson to Tottenham for £70,000 and also agreed two loan deals for the Swedish club, that of Crouch and Alton Thelwell.

On 28 July 2000, Tottenham sold Crouch to First Division club Queens Park Rangers for £60,000. He made an immediate impression with QPR, scoring ten league goals in the 2000–01 season, but it was not enough to prevent the team's relegation to the Second Division.

Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and Portsmouth bought Crouch for £1.5 million. Crouch scored 18 league goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth during the 2001–02 season and was tipped by manager Graham Rix to have a big future in the game.

In March 2002, Premier League club Aston Villa made a successful £5 million bid for Crouch. He scored on his home debut for Villa, the equalising goal against Newcastle United, and went on to score twice in seven appearances. Crouch, however, failed to hold down a regular place in the Aston Villa team in the following 2002–03 season making 18 appearances without scoring. Looking for first team football, he was loaned to Norwich City from September to December 2003. Crouch played 15 times for the Canaries in 2003–04, scoring four goals helping the team gain promotion. Crouch was sent off for retaliation during Norwich's 3–1 win at Walsall, but nonetheless his spell at Norwich renewed interest in his abilities from other clubs.

At the end of the three-month loan, he returned to Aston Villa, and scored a brace against Leicester City, a late winner at Middlesbrough and the opener at Bolton Wanderers. Villa sold Crouch in July 2004 to Southampton for a fee of £2.5 million.

Despite initially being back-up to first choice strikers James Beattie and Kevin Phillips, Crouch became the main attacking focus of the Southampton team upon the arrival of Harry Redknapp and the sale of Beattie. He scored many key goals in Southampton's relegation battle, including memorable goals against Liverpool in a 2–0 home win, Arsenal in a 1–1 home draw and two away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory. He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and Saints' arch-rival Portsmouth out of the FA Cup. His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first England call-up. After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the 2004–05 season, his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the Premier League. On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7 million to Liverpool on a four-year contract.

Crouch underwent intense media scrutiny because of a goal drought during his first months at Liverpool. For 19 matches—the span of four months—he was unable to score. Crouch was praised for other facets of his game, such as his touch on the ball, but his first goal for the club evaded him. The fact that Crouch possessed "good touch for a big man" became something of a media cliché during this time. Early in his Liverpool career, the supporters composed a new chant: "He's big, he's red, his feet stick out the bed, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch."

The drought finally ended on 3 December 2005 when he scored against Wigan Athletic. Although this first goal was originally given as an own goal, it was later awarded to Crouch on appeal; he went on to score a second goal in the same match. Before these goals, Crouch had played over 24 hours of football for Liverpool without scoring. In addition to this, he also had to deal with unpleasant taunts from crowds at matches, as he had throughout his footballing career, who often chanted "freak" at him due to his unusual height. He went on to score several goals that season, including the only goal in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Manchester United, Liverpool's first victory over them in the FA Cup post-Second World War. On 13 May, he helped Liverpool to win the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham United, providing an assist for Steven Gerrard to score the second Liverpool goal.

Three months later, in the curtain-raiser to the 2006–07 season, he headed the winning goal for Liverpool in the club's 2–1 victory over Chelsea in the FA Community Shield. In their 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign, he scored his first goals in European club competition against Maccabi Haifa. Crouch sustained a broken nose when playing against Sheffield United in February 2007. Although he played in some subsequent matches, on 9 March 2007, it was announced that he would undergo surgery on the injury that would keep him out of football for a month. On 31 March, he returned to action after the operation and scored the first hat-trick of his club career, coming against Arsenal in a 4–1 victory. This was also a so-called "perfect hat-trick," consisting of goals scored from his right foot, left foot and head. He later participated in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute for Javier Mascherano as Liverpool were defeated by Milan in Athens. He ended the 2006–07 season as Liverpool's top goalscorer in all competitions, with eighteen goals.

At the start of the 2007–08 season, he had restricted opportunities to play for Liverpool due to the arrival of other strikers, including Fernando Torres, but nonetheless scored against Toulouse in a Champions League qualifying win in August, his eighth goal in his past ten appearances in that competition, and then also scoring the first and last goals of an 8–0 win over Beşiktaş in the first round of the Champions League in November. On 19 December, Crouch was sent off in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, receiving a straight red card for a foul on Chelsea's John Obi Mikel as Liverpool exited the tournament. In April, he scored a vital goal in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, helping Liverpool secure fourth spot ahead of local rivals Everton.

On 7 July 2008, it was announced that Crouch had verbally agreed to join former club and FA Cup holders Portsmouth in a deal worth up to £11 million. Crouch passed his medical the following day, and, on 11 July, Crouch's transfer was officially unveiled at a Portsmouth news conference. Crouch scored his first goal on his return to Portsmouth in a 3–0 win against Everton at Goodison Park on 30 August 2008. Crouch then went on to net his first goal at Portsmouth's Fratton Park home ground in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur on 28 September. On 2 October 2008, Crouch scored twice in extra time in a UEFA Cup match away to Portuguese team Vitória de Guimarães to help Portsmouth reach the group stages of the competition. He went on to score twice against Heerenveen in a 3–0 victory at Fratton Park, however Portsmouth failed to make it out of the group stages. Crouch played 46 times for Pompey in 2008–09, scoring 16 goals as the side finished in 14th position.

On 27 July 2009, Tottenham Hotspur signed Crouch from Portsmouth for a fee of £10 million, on a five-year contract. Crouch made his debut for Spurs in a pre-season friendly against Olympiacos, and came on as a substitute in Tottenham's season opening win over Liverpool, making his full Premier League debut for the club in the process. He scored his first goal for Tottenham in the League Cup tie against Doncaster Rovers in a 5–1 win on 26 August 2009. He scored again in his next match, opening his league account with Spurs with a goal in a 2–1 home win against Birmingham City. On 23 September, Crouch scored his first hat-trick for Spurs in a 5–1 win over Preston North End in the League Cup. In May, his late goal against Manchester City in what was being dubbed as the "£15 million pound game" put Spurs in a position to claim their first-ever Champions League berth. After having hit the post and missed a Benoît Assou-Ekotto cross, Crouch scored a header after goalkeeper Márton Fülöp could only parry the ball into his path.

On 25 August 2010, Crouch scored a hat-trick at White Hart Lane against Young Boys to help Tottenham to reach the group stage of the 2010–11 Champions League. On 15 February 2011, Crouch scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the Champions League second round, first leg match against Milan at the San Siro, sweeping home Aaron Lennon's cut-back after a counter-attack. Three weeks later, Spurs progressed to the quarter-finals after the reverse fixture at White Hart Lane ended 0–0. On 5 April, he was sent off in the 14th minute after receiving two yellow cards in the quarter-finals against Real Madrid. He scored an own goal against Manchester City, which consequently confirmed City into the Champions League for the 2011–12 season with Tottenham missing out.

On 31 August 2011, Stoke City signed Crouch from Tottenham for a club record fee of £10 million, that would rise to £12 million, on a four-year contract. Speaking after sealing his move to the Britannia Stadium, Crouch revealed that his former Tottenham teammate Jonathan Woodgate was a major influence upon his decision to join Stoke. Crouch made his debut for Stoke City in a 1–0 win against former club Liverpool on 10 September 2011. He scored his first goal for the Potters in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United, making Stoke the sixth Premier League club he has scored for. He scored his second goal in the following match against Beşiktaş in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League campaign. Crouch went on to score against Arsenal, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers before missing out on the Christmas period matches after suffering from a virus.

On 2 January 2012, against Blackburn, Crouch scored both goals in a 2–1 victory. It was a landmark achievement for Crouch as he surpassed 100 league goals. On 24 March 2012, Crouch scored a stunning volley against Manchester City in a 1–1 draw at the Britannia Stadium. After the match, Crouch stated that it was the best goal of his career. He scored the winning goal for Stoke against their Midlands rivals Wolves on 7 April to take his goal tally to 13 and was backed by manager Tony Pulis to earn a recall to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. At the end of season awards dinner, Crouch won the club's Player of the Year and Goal of the Season awards.

Crouch began the 2012–13 season well, scoring five goals in seven matches, against Swindon Town, Wigan Athletic, Manchester City and a brace against Swansea City. He lost several teeth after being accidentally kicked in the mouth by Fabricio Coloccini in a match against Newcastle United on 28 November 2012 and as a result had to undergo corrective surgery. He then went three months without a goal before scoring against Wigan on 29 January 2013. Crouch again went through a three-month barren spell in front of goal before scoring against former club Queens Park Rangers on 20 April 2013 in a 2–0 victory. He scored on the final day of the season against Southampton as he ended the 2012–13 season with eight goals, with Stoke finishing 13th in the league.

Mark Hughes replaced Tony Pulis as manager in May 2013 and despite starting the first two matches of the 2013–14 season, Hughes dropped Crouch to the bench. He returned to the starting line up on 26 October 2013 and scored in a 3–2 defeat against Manchester United. Crouch retained his place in the team for the remainder of the 2013–14 season, where he finished as top scorer with ten goals in 38 appearances as Stoke finished in ninth place.

Crouch scored his first goals of 2014–15 in September 2014 against QPR and Newcastle. In October 2014, Crouch stated that he would like to remain at the Britannia Stadium with Stoke for the remainder of his career. On 29 October 2014, Crouch came on as a substitute in Stoke's League Cup defeat to Southampton; 15 minutes later, he was sent off for two yellow cards in the space of two minutes. On 6 December, he scored after 19 seconds against Arsenal in an eventual 3–2 victory. A week later, in his 600th match in English football, Crouch scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Crystal Palace. Crouch signed a two-year contract extension in January 2015.

On 28 February 2015, Crouch scored the winning goal in Stoke's 1–0 win over Hull City, equaling Alan Shearer's record of 46 headed goals in the Premier League. He surpassed this on 24 May with a header five minutes after coming on as a substitute to conclude a 6–1 home win over Liverpool in Stoke's final match of the season. In total, Crouch matched the previous season's goal tally of ten goals in 38 appearances as Stoke finished in ninth position for the second consecutive season. Following the end of the season, Crouch underwent groin surgery. Crouch struggled for game time in 2015–16 making 18 appearances of which nine were as a substitute. He scored just twice, which came against lower league Fulham and Doncaster Rovers in cup competitions.

Crouch scored a hat-trick away to Stevenage in the EFL Cup, on 23 August 2016 in a 4–0 win. On 9 January 2017, Crouch signed a new contract with Stoke in a deal lasting until the summer of 2018. Crouch scored four goals in five games at the turn of the year including his 100th Premier League goal, the oldest player to hit the landmark. Crouch made 29 appearances in 2016–17, scoring ten goals, as Stoke finished in 13th position. After the season ended Crouch stated that he wants to continue playing until he is 40.

Crouch set a record for the most number of appearances as substitute in the Premier League, on 20 November 2017 when he came off the bench for the 143rd time against Brighton & Hove Albion, breaking the record held by Shola Ameobi. Crouch signed another one-year contract extension with the Potters in November 2017. Crouch played 34 times in 2017–18, scoring six goals as Stoke were relegated to the Championship.

Crouch signed for Premier League club Burnley on 31 January 2019 on a contract until the end of the 2018–19 season in a player-exchange deal with Sam Vokes. Crouch made his debut for Burnley on 2 February coming on as a 76th minute substitute in a 1–1 draw against Southampton.

Crouch was capped for the England under-20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, with teammates including Stuart Taylor, Ashley Cole, Andrew Johnson and Matthew Etherington. However, the team finished bottom at the group stage, with three losses and having scored no goals. He was later a part of David Platt's England under-21 team, which went to the finals of the European Under-21 Championship in Switzerland in May 2002, where he scored once against Switzerland.

In May 2005 he was handed his first call-up to the England senior squad by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson for the team's tour of the United States, making his debut against Colombia. He went on to make two appearances during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign for England: starting against Austria in a 1–0 victory and coming on as a substitute against Poland in a 2–1 win. In the latter appearance, Crouch's introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters. On 1 March 2006, he scored his first goal for England, with the equaliser in a 2–1 friendly win over Uruguay. He did this whilst bizarrely wearing two different squad numbers on his shirt – No. 21 on the front (his designated squad number for the match), and the incorrect No. 12 on the back.

In May 2006, Crouch was included in the 23-man England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was expected to be a significant figure in the team due to Wayne Rooney's foot injury. On 30 May, he played in a pre-World Cup friendly against Hungary, scoring the third goal in England's 3–1 win. He followed his goal with his iconic robotic dancing goal celebration. On 3 June, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 pre-World Cup friendly victory against Jamaica where he again performed his robotic celebration.

After his displays in England's friendlies, Crouch partnered with Michael Owen in attack for England's opening 2006 World Cup match against Paraguay on 10 June 2006. England won the match 1–0 and Crouch kept his place in the starting line-up for the following match against Trinidad and Tobago, against whom he scored his first competitive international goal. The goal provoked some controversy as replays showed Crouch to be pulling on Brent Sancho's long hair, holding the defender down, to gain an advantage.

Crouch was rested for England's third group match against Sweden as Rooney returned from injury to join the starting line-up. However, Owen suffered a serious knee injury in the opening minute of the match and Crouch replaced him, playing the remainder of the match. In England's 1–0 second round victory against Ecuador, Crouch remained an unused substitute as Eriksson switched the team to a new formation with Wayne Rooney as a lone striker. After Rooney's dismissal for a foul in England's quarter-final against Portugal, Crouch came on as a substitute for Joe Cole, as England went on to get knocked out on penalties. On 5 September 2007, retired English referee Graham Poll claimed that FIFA had specifically warned referees at the event to pay close attention to Crouch, claiming that "he's a real pain and he's getting away with too much."

Crouch remained a part of the England set-up under Eriksson's successor as manager, Steve McClaren, and started McClaren's first match in charge, a friendly against Greece in August 2006. He scored twice in England's 4–0 victory. Two further goals followed in England's next match, a 5–0 win over Andorra in their opening qualifying match for UEFA Euro 2008 on 2 September 2006. Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year. In fact, this had happened several times pre-Second World War, most recently by Dixie Dean (12 goals in 1927) and George Camsell (11 goals in 1929). An operation needed for a nose injury he sustained playing for Liverpool prevented him from playing in England's two qualifying matches in March 2007. He returned to the England squad for their matches against Brazil and Estonia in late May and early June 2007, scoring in the qualifying match against the latter. Crouch was England's top scorer in the qualifying campaign with five goals, but this did not prevent England finishing only third in their group and failing to progress to the finals of the competition.

On 1 April 2009, Crouch made his first start under McClaren's successor, Fabio Capello, in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Ukraine. He scored England's first goal in their 2–1 victory. Crouch was re-called to the England squad for the friendly against Slovenia and the World Cup qualifier versus Croatia, following his fine form for Tottenham. Crouch also got an early first half goal against Belarus in the final 2010 World Cup qualifier, which he then followed up with a second goal in the 76th minute. This took Crouch's tally for England up to 18 goals in just 17 starts. Crouch scored a brace after coming on as a substitute against Egypt in a friendly on 3 March 2010 to take his overall international goal tally to 20. He also scored the second goal for England against Mexico at Wembley Stadium on 24 May 2010.

Crouch was named in Capello's final 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup and was given the number 9 shirt. He came on as a substitute for Emile Heskey in England's opening match against the United States and also came off the bench for Gareth Barry in the following match against Algeria. Crouch did not take part in the final group stage match with Slovenia or the 4–1 loss to Germany in the last-16.

Crouch came on as a substitute in the home friendly against France for the injured Steven Gerrard on 17 November 2010. He scored quickly from an Ashley Young corner to make the score 1–2 with an angled side-footed volley. It was his second touch of the ball. After not making an appearance for England for almost a year, Crouch stated in October 2011 that he "does not carry much hope" of receiving a call-up.

During a run of good form in September 2017, Crouch said in a television interview that he was not officially retired from international football.

Although generally known as "Crouchy," other nicknames he has been given by fans and the media in England have included "RoboCrouch" and "Crouchinho" (an ironic use of the "-inho" suffix, meaning "little" in Portuguese and used by many Brazilian footballers). He has been also referred to as "Mr. Roboto" by Univision's commentators and as "Pantera Rosa" ("Pink Panther") by Fox Sports en Español commentators.

In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing goal celebration. A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate David Beckham's house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May. He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June. The "Daily Mirror" newspaper wrote that the dance was inspired by the lyrics to the Arctic Monkeys' hit single "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor".

On 12 June, Crouch announced he would perform his robotic dance again only if England were to win the World Cup, saying, "It's not about robotic dancing. It is about scoring goals and winning matches. It's an important time for everyone now." In September 2006, he was quoted in "The Observer" newspaper as saying that, "It was funny at the time, but I didn't want to carry on doing it until it became unfunny. I've stopped doing it for the time being, but if I ever score a really big goal you never know."

On 6 August 2007, Crouch said he would never use the robot dance again unless he scored in the UEFA Champions League Final, but he partially reprised it on 1 April 2009 after scoring during England's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine after a Comic Relief sketch.

On 1 February 2017, Crouch gave the dance a final outing to celebrate his 100th Premier League goal.

Crouch and model Abbey Clancy married on 30 June 2011. Together they have two daughters and a son, Sophia Ruby (born March 2011), Liberty Rose (born June 2015) and Johnny (born January 2018).

In August 2012, Crouch was found guilty of speeding in November 2011 and ordered to pay a fine of £1,000. On 16 October 2012, Crouch was disqualified from driving for six months. Crouch released his autobiography in 2007, titled "Walking Tall – My Story". His second book, "How to be a Footballer", was released in 2018. In Autumn 2018, the first series of "That Peter Crouch Podcast" aired, featuring Crouch along with Tom Fordyce and Chris Stark.

Steven Defour

Steven Arnold Defour (born 15 April 1988) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Burnley.

In his senior career he played for Genk, Standard Liège, Porto, Anderlecht and Burnley, winning nine honours with the second and third teams combined.

Defour earned his first cap for Belgium in 2006, and represented the nation in the 2014 World Cup.

Born in Mechelen, Defour played youth football with local KV Mechelen, moving to K.R.C. Genk in 2004 due to the club's financial difficulties. He made his Pro League debut during the 2004–05 season and, at just 17, became first-choice, finishing the 2005–06 campaign with 26 games and one goal to help his team to the fifth position.

When Genk failed to qualify for European competition, Defour tried to move to AFC Ajax in the summer of 2006. Genk, enraged by earlier reports that the Dutch team had approached the player to broker a deal without their consent, did not accept the proposed transfer fee and after protracted negotiations Ajax pulled out of the deal. Defour tried to force a transfer by threatening to leave, using a Belgian law that allowed professional athletes on fixed-term contracts to leave their employers before the end of the stipulated term, but Ajax did not express a renewed interest in his services and he ended up signing for Standard Liège for a much-reduced transfer fee, effectively breaking a gentlemen's agreement between Belgian sides not to sign under-contract players using the aforementioned law.

Defour joined Standard on a five-year deal, being appointed team captain at the start of his second year after taking over from Portugal's Sérgio Conceição – he was just 19 years old. He received the Belgian Golden Shoe at the end of the season in the process, leading the "Reds" to their first league title in 25 years.

In late 2009, shortly after scoring four goals in 31 games to help Standard renew its domestic supremacy, Defour broke his right foot. During his period of recovery he received a letter from Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, wishing him all the best in his recovery, and this led to persistent rumours of a switch to the English club, but he refuted these by saying "I do know that Manchester United are monitoring me – if everything goes well and I continue playing as I am, there is a better chance of me leaving than there was at the start of the season"; eventually, nothing came of it.

On 15 August 2011, Portuguese club FC Porto agreed with Standard Liége to buy the sporting rights of Defour for €6 million, and he signed a five-year contract. He finished his first year with 37 appearances all competitions comprised and added two goals, helping his new team win the Primeira Liga championship.

On 18 September 2012, Defour netted Porto's second goal against GNK Dinamo Zagreb, in the season's Champions League group stage (2–0 away win). On 13 March of the following year, for the same competition but in the round-of-16, he was booked twice and subsequently sent off in the 49th minute of the second leg of the tie at Málaga CF, as the northerners lost 0–2 at La Rosaleda Stadium and 1–2 on aggregate.

On 13 August 2014, Defour signed a five-year deal with R.S.C. Anderlecht, for €6 million. On 25 January of the following year, when playing at Standard Liège, he was sent off for deliberately kicking the ball at home fans who had unfurled a banner depicting his severed head under the slogan "Red or Dead". His ejection caused the visiting supporters to rip out their seats and throw them onto the pitch, and the banner received criticism from both the Royal Belgian Football Association and the league.

On 16 August 2016, Defour signed for Premier League club Burnley for a club-record transfer fee of £8 million. He made his competitive debut four days later, starting in a 2–0 home win over Liverpool in which he helped create the second goal by Andre Gray but was substituted early in the second half due to a lack of fitness. On 10 September, also at Turf Moor, he scored his first goal for his new team to open a 1–1 draw with fellow promotee Hull City, and was praised after the match by manager Sean Dyche.

Defour made his debut for the Belgian senior team in May 2006, aged just 18. He scored his first goal on 6 September 2008, in a 3–2 win against Estonia at his club ground the Stade Maurice Dufrasne for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Defour scored once in three appearances in qualification for the 2014 World Cup, opening a 2–0 win away to Scotland on 6 September 2013. He was selected for the finals in Brazil by manager Marc Wilmots, making his debut in the competition on 26 June in the third group stage match against South Korea after Belgium had already won their first two outings and sealed qualification, and was sent off in the last minute of the first half of the eventual 1–0 success after a rash tackle on Kim Shin-wook.

On 25 May 2018, 30-year-old Defour announced his retirement from international football.

Joe Hart

Charles Joseph John Hart (born 19 April 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Burnley and the English national team. With over 100 Premier League clean sheets, Hart holds the joint record for the most Premier League Golden Glove awards (four) and has amassed 75 international caps since his debut in 2008.

He began his career at his hometown club Shrewsbury Town in the Football Conference and League Two. In 2006, he moved to top-flight Manchester City, having attracted the attention of several Premier League teams. He spent time on loan at Tranmere Rovers and Blackpool in his first season, before spending the 2009–10 season at Birmingham City. Hart was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year and was voted as the Premier League goalkeeper of the 2009–10 season in recognition of his performances at Birmingham. He returned to Manchester City for the 2010–11 season and won the Golden Glove for keeping the most clean sheets throughout the Premier League season. Hart replicated this feat in the 2011–12 season and was a key player during City's title-winning campaign. He won the Golden Glove for the third year in a row in the following season, and earned a second Premier League title in 2014. In 2015, Hart once again won the Golden Glove award for the fourth time in five years. With the arrival of Pep Guardiola in 2016, Hart was dropped for selection by the new manager and made only one appearance in the Champions League before moving on loan to Torino and West Ham United in successive seasons. He then signed a permanent transfer to Burnley after having being told he had no first team future with City.
A former regular for England at Under-21 level, Hart made his senior international debut in June 2008, and was recognised as England's first-choice goalkeeper from 2010 to 2017. He has gained over 70 caps and was selected in England's squads for two FIFA World Cups and as many UEFA European Championships.

Hart was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, to Charles Hart, who sold gym equipment, and his wife Louise, a nursery school teacher. He attended Oxon Primary School, followed by Meole Brace School in Shrewsbury, where he was Head Boy in his final year. As a schoolboy, he was an equally competent cricketer and briefly played for Shrewsbury CC in the Birmingham and District Premier League and also spent two years in Worcestershire's youth squads, playing alongside England cricketer Steven Davies.

While still a 15-year-old schoolboy, Hart travelled with the first-team squad of his hometown club, Shrewsbury Town, to Exeter City on 1 February 2003. He was a non-playing substitute on that occasion and fulfilled that role again versus Rochdale at Gay Meadow on 1 March 2003, still some six weeks short of his 16th birthday. This match yielded Shrewsbury's final victory in a season that culminated in relegation to the Football Conference. During the one season that Shrewsbury spent in the Conference, Hart made his senior debut on 20 April 2004, a day after his 17th birthday. He played the full 90 minutes in the match against Gravesend & Northfleet. Four days later, he conceded three at Morecambe.

Hart did not play again until April of the following year, as Scott Howie dominated goalkeeping duties. With Shrewsbury back in the Football League (the newly renamed League Two) and struggling, Hart played six matches, conceding four goals.

From the start of the 2005–06 season, Hart made the step up into the first team, and became the club's first-choice goalkeeper. He played a full 46-match league season, conceding 55 goals. Despite conceding more than one goal per game, Hart won plaudits for his personal performances, winning his first England under-19 cap in October 2005, as a substitute against Poland.

Hart also found admirers in the Premier League, with several top-flight scouts attending matches. On 30 November 2005, the "Shropshire Star" newspaper reported that Everton goalkeeping coach Chris Woods had been present at Town's previous league match, a 4–3 loss at Rochdale. Manager Gary Peters said "Everton have been to watch him, but you could say the same about Arsenal, Chelsea and every other team in the Premiership." Speculation about his future continued for the duration of the season, and with the presence of their goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers at several matches, Manchester City became the most likely of his suitors.

Hart was announced as the top League Two player for January 2006 in the PFA Fans' Player of the Month Awards, voted for by fans via the Professional Footballers' Association website. At the PFA Awards ceremony on 23 March 2006, it was announced that Hart had been voted as League Two's best goalkeeper for 2005–06 by his fellow professionals, earning him a place in the League Two PFA Team of the Year.

Hart's move to Manchester City was completed as soon as Hart returned from England under-19 duty in Belgium, where a defeat to Serbia and Montenegro in the elite round meant England failed to qualify for the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. It was reported at the time that City were to pay an initial £600,000 fee for Hart, rising to £1.5 million if undisclosed clauses were achieved, but John Wardle, then City chairman, revealed in 2012 that the transfer fee was actually £100,000. Hart was recommended to City hierarchy by the club's goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers who believed he had great potential. Hart made his debut for City on 14 October 2006 after injuries ruled out Andreas Isaksson and Nicky Weaver for the Premier League match against Sheffield United. He kept a clean sheet in the match, which finished goalless.

Hart spent January 2007 on loan to League One club Tranmere Rovers. He made six appearances and conceded eight goals. He was then named in his then club manager Stuart Pearce's first squad in his part-time role as England U21 coach, alongside another goalkeeper uncapped at U21 level, Ben Alnwick. He was not chosen to start the match on 6 February 2007 against Spain, but did come on as a substitute late in the match.

In April 2007, Hart joined Blackpool on loan as cover for the injured trio of Rhys Evans, Paul Rachubka and Lewis Edge. He kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 win for Blackpool away to Huddersfield Town on 9 April 2007, in his first appearance for "the Seasiders". Blackpool won all five matches in which Hart appeared, including a 6–3 win away to Swansea City in his final appearance.

On his return from a successful loan spell at Blackpool, then Manchester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson named Hart as Manchester City's number one ahead of Andreas Isaksson. After his performance against Newcastle United, Eriksson named him as "one of the biggest talents in this country as a goalkeeper", and that he had the potential to become an England international in the future. Only months later, he made his England debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. In October, he was inducted to Shropshire Schools & Colleges Football Association's Hall of Fame along with former teammate David Edwards in recognition of their achievements. Later that month, he signed a new five-year contract.

After Isaksson's departure to PSV Eindhoven, Hart took the vacant number 1 jersey when the official squad numbers for the 2008–09 season were announced. However, his position as first-choice keeper was taken by Shay Given upon the Irishman's arrival at the club in January 2009.

Having made no appearances for City since Given's arrival, rumours began to emerge of a loan move away from Manchester. City secured the transfer of Stuart Taylor from Aston Villa on 23 June 2009, paving the way for Hart to leave. The following day it was announced that Hart would spend the 2009–10 Premier League season on loan to newly promoted Birmingham City. He made his debut in Birmingham's opening match of the season, a 1–0 defeat away to Manchester United.

In the early part of the season, Hart made some errors which cost Birmingham City goals, and Maik Taylor's clean sheet against Manchester City, a match for which Hart was ineligible, left manager Alex McLeish with a selection dilemma. McLeish chose Hart, who kept his place in the starting 11 as Birmingham went on a club-record 12-match unbeaten run in the top division and set a Premier League record by fielding the same starting 11 for nine consecutive matches. His performances improved: against Chelsea in December, he "showed not only sharp judgment and reflexes, making three outstanding saves ... but a lack of fear also", despite needing staples in a gashed head sustained when diving at the feet of Salomon Kalou. Hart was voted Birmingham City's Player of the Year for 2009–10, and nominated for the 2010 PFA Young Player of the Year award alongside Wayne Rooney, Cesc Fàbregas and James Milner. Though Milner won that award, Hart earned a place in the PFA Team of the Year.

After a successful spell at Birmingham, Hart earned a place in the England squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini was unsure over the future of Hart and dispatched his goalkeeping coach, Massimo Battara to watch over him during his loan spell at Birmingham City. Battara reported that Hart was a "very good goalkeeper, with very high physical and technical abilities" and advised that he kept Hart in his plans for the years ahead. One of the major pre-season debates was whether Hart would start ahead of the experienced Shay Given after his return to City following an impressive loan spell with Birmingham City.

Hart was chosen ahead of Shay Given to start the opening match of the 2010–11 season against Tottenham Hotspur. He produced a man of the match performance, saving numerous challenging shots including a deflected effort from Benoît Assou-Ekotto, which helped City to draw the match 0–0. Hart also kept a clean sheet in Manchester City's 3–0 victory over Liverpool, where he was still first-choice goalkeeper and made even more good saves, enhancing his reputation even further. Hart conceded his first goal of the season from a late penalty by Darren Bent in a 1–0 defeat at Sunderland, and made an error that led to Blackburn Rovers' opening goal in a 1–1 draw two weeks later.

Hart helped his team overcome Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final by producing an excellent early save to deny Dimitar Berbatov the opening goal; the match ended 1–0 to City, thanks to a goal scored by Yaya Touré. He kept another clean sheet against Tottenham Hotspur to earn his team a place in the Champions League for the first time, and another in the FA Cup final in which Manchester City beat Stoke City 1–0 with another goal from Touré.

Hart's 18 clean sheets in the 2010–11 Premier League season earned him the Premier League Golden Glove award. He also set a new club record for the most clean sheets during a season, with 29; the previous mark was set by Nicky Weaver with 26 when the team were playing two divisions lower. He also received City's Performance of the Season award for the match against Tottenham Hotspur in August 2010. Hart's position as City's "number one" was cemented when Given departed City for Aston Villa in July 2011. On 8 August 2011, he signed a new contract until 2016. Hart won the Golden Glove award for the second year running in 2011–12, and helped City to win their first Premier League title, and first top-flight title for 44 years, which they clinched on the final day of the season by beating Queens Park Rangers 3–2.

Hart's form dipped in the 2012–13 Premier League season, although he still won the Golden Glove award for keeping most clean sheets despite rivals Manchester United regaining their title as revenge for the previous season's last-day title win on goal difference. He started in goal for Manchester City in the 2013 FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic but let in a 90th-minute header by Ben Watson; Wigan won 1–0, and City ended the season without winning a trophy. His form continued to dip in the 2013–14 Premier League season and, following conceding a decisive 90th-minute goal by Fernando Torres in a 2–1 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 27 October, he was replaced by Costel Pantilimon for a home match against Norwich City which City won 7–0. A month later, Hart returned to the Manchester City team for a Champions League group match against Viktoria Plzeň. Hart regained his place as City's starting goalkeeper in the Premier League in a 4–2 win over Fulham on 21 December 2013, and remained first choice as the team went on to win the league for the second time in three seasons.

On 24 February 2015, Hart saved a penalty kick from five-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi in a Champions League round of 16 fixture against Barcelona. After the return leg of the same tie Messi described Hart as a "phenomenon" after a performance where he produced a record-breaking 10 saves during the match. Hart ended the 2014–15 season by keeping a clean sheet against Southampton in his 300th appearance for Manchester City to win the Premier League Golden Glove award for the fourth time.

As he had been in 2014, Hart was on the bench for the 2016 League Cup Final; this time, his understudy Willy Caballero featured in a penalty shoot-out victory against Liverpool. On 6 April, Hart saved a penalty kick from Zlatan Ibrahimović in Manchester City's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. It was his second penalty save of the season's competition, after previously keeping out Raffael's kick in a 2–1 group stage win at Borussia Mönchengladbach on 30 September 2015.

On 13 August 2016, Hart was dropped by new manager Pep Guardiola for the first match of the 2016–17 Premier League season. The absence followed his poor performances at UEFA Euro 2016, and Guardiola's desire for a player with better footwork who could fill a sweeper-keeper role. Hart made his first start of the 2016–17 season in a Champions League qualifying match against Steaua Bucharest, as captain of the City side that won 1–0 on the night, 6–0 on aggregate. Following the match, Hart was applauded by the crowd, in an atmosphere which was described as resembling a pre-departure testimonial. Following speculation linking Hart with various top European clubs, including Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Everton, Liverpool, Milan and Sevilla, Hart surprisingly decided to pursue a season-long loan in the Serie A with Torino. In doing so, he became the first English goalkeeper to sign for a Serie A club since the league's inception in 1929.

On 11 September 2016, Hart suffered a tough start in his debut for Torino, being partly at fault for the equaliser in a 2–1 away defeat to Atalanta when his punch from a corner fell at the feet of an opposing attacker who scored. However, Hart then kept consecutive clean sheets in his next two appearances against Empoli and Pescara, both of which ended 0–0. Hart played in all 36 of Torino's remaining league matches in the 2016–17 season, but in April the club's president Urbano Cairo suggested his level of performance had dropped amid transfer speculation.

The club finished in ninth position (of 20) in Serie A, conceding 66 goals in 38 matches, the fourth-highest number in the league.

On 18 July 2017, Hart signed for Premier League club West Ham United on a season-long loan, having been permitted to find another club by City. He made his debut for West Ham on 13 August 2017, in a 4–0 defeat away to Manchester United and conceded 10 goals in his first three appearances, although West Ham captain Mark Noble defended his goalkeeper's performances. In a "Daily Telegraph" article, it was claimed that opposing forwards were able to exploit a "weakness" against "low shots to his left."

On 7 August 2018, Burnley announced the signing of Hart from Manchester City on an initial two-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £3.5m.
He made his Burnley debut on 9 August in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Europa League against İstanbul Başakşehir keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw.

Hart made his first international appearance in September 2005 in an England under-19 friendly match against Belgium at Darlington; replacing starting goalkeeper Ben Alnwick at half-time, he was unable to save the penalty that made the score 3–2, but with three minutes left made a "terrific one on one save" from an unmarked attacker. He played in five more matches for the under-19s, his last a 1–0 defeat away to Serbia and Montenegro on 22 May 2006.

After making his under-21 debut as a substitute for Scott Carson in a 2–2 draw with Spain, Hart was selected by Stuart Pearce in the preliminary England Under-21 30-man squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and made the final 23. In the team's final friendly before the finals, Hart was selected for his first under-21 start, and played the full 90 minutes in a 5–0 win over Slovakia at Carrow Road. However, Hart took no part in the finals, with Carson playing in all four of England's fixtures.

Hart played in all the qualifying matches for the 2009 European Championships, In the finals, he started the first two group-stage matches and was rested for the last match as England had already sealed their passage to the knock-out stage. In the semi-final against Sweden, he conceded three goals in the second half as the match ended 3–3 after extra time, but made up for it by saving a penalty and scoring another as England won 5–4 in the shoot-out. However, he was yellow-carded for leaving his line to talk to Mikael Lustig as he prepared to take his penalty. England's appeal was rejected, so Hart was suspended for the final; Scott Loach kept goal as England lost 4–0 to Germany.

Having been a regular in the England under-21 squad, Hart was called up by Fabio Capello to the senior England team for the friendly matches against the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. An unused substitute against the United States, he made his debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008 at the Hasely Crawford Stadium, Port of Spain. He came on at half time for David James with England 2–0 up, eventually running out 3–0 winners. However, Hart's senior England debut did not earn Shrewsbury Town the expected bonus of £500,000 from Manchester City, as negotiated as part of his transfer in 2006, because it was not a competitive match.

Hart kept his place in the squad for a friendly against the Czech Republic in August, but remained unused. After Blackburn Rovers goalkeeper Paul Robinson withdrew from the squad for World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Belarus in October 2009, Hart took his place, and in November, he was called up for a friendly against Brazil, but he did not appear in either match.

Capello named Hart in his provisional 30-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Hart played the second half of both of England's warm-up matches, replacing Robert Green against Mexico and James against Japan, and kept a clean sheet in each case. All three goalkeepers, Hart, Green and James, were included in the final 23-man selection.

Hart did not feature in the World Cup but started England's next match, a friendly against Hungary, to earn his fourth cap. He conceded his first England goal in dubious circumstances when the ball appeared not to have crossed the line from a deflection from Phil Jagielka, and made a vital late save from Zoltán Gera as England won 2–1. Hart was given his first competitive cap in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier, a 4–0 win against Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium; he made three crucial saves, one of which he palmed away to begin the counterattack that led to an England goal. He won another two caps November 2011 in friendlies against world champions Spain and Sweden, in each case keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 England victory.

In February 2012, after the position was stripped from John Terry, some players and pundits backed Hart for England captaincy citing his strong performances and positive image.

On 16 May 2012, new England manager Roy Hodgson named Hart in his UEFA Euro 2012 squad. He played in England's second warm-up friendly, against Belgium at Wembley Stadium, keeping a clean sheet as England won 1–0. In the tournament he made the most saves of any goalkeeper in the group phase with 14. However, he was beaten by Andrea Pirlo's "panenka" shot in England's penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the quarter-finals. Pirlo had stated that Hart's antics led to him thinking that "he had to get off his high horse".

On 6 February 2013, Hart saved a penalty kick and the subsequent follow-up shot from Ronaldinho in a friendly match against Brazil at Wembley Stadium. This double save proved to be crucial in helping England win the match 2–1, and thereby securing their first win over Brazil for 23 years.

Hart was selected for his second FIFA World Cup in 2014. He made his tournament debut in England's first group match, a 2–1 defeat to Italy in Manaus, and also played in the next match, a loss by the same scoreline to Uruguay. With England not likely to advance, Hodgson made changes for their last match, against Costa Rica, with Ben Foster playing in goal instead.

In October 2014, England fans voted Hart man of the match against San Marinoin which he made only one save and rarely touched the balland repeated the exercise a few days later against Estonia; Jack Wilshere was the official best player in each fixture. Hart became the sixth English goalkeeper to earn his 50th cap, in a 1–1 friendly draw with Italy at Juventus Stadium on 31 March 2015. On 13 November that year, with Rooney rested, he captained England for the first time in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Spain in Alicante.

Hart was included in England's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016. In the second match, against Wales in Lens, he made an error to allow Gareth Bale to score from a long-range free kick, although England came back to win 2–1. Hart made another mistake to let in a winning goal from Kolbeinn Sigþórsson in the defeat to Iceland in the last 16, after which he admitted that criticism of the team would be justifiable.

Despite being England's goalkeeper at their three most recent major tournaments, on 16 May 2018, he was left out of Gareth Southgate's 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 27 June 2015, Hart married Kimberley Crew, his girlfriend of six years, in Florence, Italy.
In October 2017, Hart was targeted in his car by thieves in Romford, who stole his watch, wallet and mobile phone while he was at a petrol station.

Anders Lindegaard

Anders Rozenkrantz Lindegaard (; born 13 April 1984) is a Danish footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Burnley and the Denmark national team. He began his career with his hometown club, Odense Boldklub, but a lack of first-team opportunities led to a move to Norwegian club Aalesund in 2009, with whom he won the Norwegian Football Cup. After winning the Goalkeeper of the Year award in both Denmark and Norway in 2010, Lindegaard was signed by Manchester United, where he played for five years as a back-up to Edwin van der Sar and David de Gea. He moved to West Bromwich Albion in 2015, but was unable to break into the team and joined Preston North End in January 2016, initially on loan. He joined Burnley in September 2017.

Lindegaard represented Denmark at under-19 and under-20 level before making his senior debut on 7 September 2010 against Iceland. He went on to win 5 caps for his country.

Born in the Dyrup suburb of Odense, Lindegaard started his career at local Danish Superliga team Odense Boldklub (OB). He made his Danish Superliga debut in a 3–1 victory against Silkeborg IF on 19 November 2006. He made his UEFA competition debut on 30 July 2009, in a 4–3 win over Rabotnički. During most of his time with OB, he was kept out of the team by Arek Onyszko, and he had two loan spells at Kolding FC, where he remained undefeated in the ten league games he got for the team, after it had lost the first four games of the season, and Aalesunds FK, who he would later join permanently. When Onyszko was sacked by Odense in June 2009 due to him being convicted for assaulting his ex-wife, Lindegaard was seen as his replacement. The arrival of Roy Carroll at Odense two months later, however, forced him to move on.

In 2009, he joined Norwegian club Aalesunds FK on loan and later permanently. In 2009, he won the Norwegian Football Cup with Aalesund. In 2010, Lindegaard was named Goalkeeper of the Year in both Norway and Denmark.

Since early November 2010, he was reported to have become a target for English club Manchester United. Former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, however, opined that Lindegaard was not yet ready for regular Premier League action. On 23 November 2010, it was reported that Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expected to complete the signing of the player in the "next two or three weeks". On 27 November 2010, Lindegaard joined Manchester United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £3.5 million. He trained with the first team throughout December, but he was unable to play for his new club until the transfer window re-opened on 1 January 2011. Lindegaard was officially registered with the Premier League on 6 January, and assigned the number 34 jersey.

On 29 January, Lindegaard made his Manchester United debut in a 2–1 victory against Southampton in the FA Cup Fourth Round. He made his Old Trafford home debut on 19 February in another FA Cup match, this time against the Conference National side Crawley Town, in which United won 1–0. In March, he underwent knee surgery that would keep him out of action for five weeks.

On 16 May, Lindegaard played in the Manchester Senior Cup final for the Manchester United Reserves against Bolton Wanderers Reserves, which United went on to win 3–1.

On 14 September, Lindegaard made his first UEFA Champions League start for United against Portuguese side Benfica. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with Lindegaard winning critical acclaim for his performance. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, still decided to continue with first-choice keeper David de Gea for the next match in the Premier League against Chelsea. Asked about challenging for the first-team spot, Lindegaard said, "What answer do you expect to that question? I've said a thousand times before I'm not here to pick my nose." On 18 October, Lindegaard was handed his second Champions League start for United. He played against Oțelul Galați, with the match ending in a 2–0 win for United, earning them their first Champions League Group stage victory.

On 1 October 2011, Lindegaard made his Premier League debut for United against Norwich City in a 2–0 win at Old Trafford. He continued his run of clean sheets in his next four appearances in the Premier League, which included a 1–0 home win against Sunderland on 5 November, a 1–0 away win against Aston Villa on 3 December, a 5–0 away win at Fulham on 21 December and a 5–0 home win against Wigan Athletic in United's Boxing day fixture. His run of clean sheets in the league finally ended on 4 January away to Newcastle United when he was beaten three times in a game that United lost 3–0. A week later, on 8 January, Lindegaard played his biggest game for Manchester United so far, a 3–2 win against Manchester City in the FA Cup. He was chosen again for the starting line-up the following week when United beat Bolton Wanderers 3–0. On 30 January 2012, he damaged ankle ligaments in training, forcing him to miss the game against Stoke City the next day, along with the unwell first-choice David de Gea, meaning youngster Ben Amos played goal. Later in the week, Sir Alex Ferguson revealed Lindegaard would miss the next four-to-five weeks and would not be expected back until the home game with West Bromwich Albion.

On 3 August 2012, Lindegaard signed a new four-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until June 2016. He also took the number 13 jersey made vacant by the departure of Park Ji-sung, who had left the club for Queens Park Rangers.

Since the match against Norwich on 17 November 2012, first-choice goalkeeper David de Gea was sidelined with wisdom teeth problems. Lindegaard was kept in goal for United's next five games until De Gea was recalled for the Champions League match against CFR Cluj. Lindegaard returned to the first team on 1 December 2012, against Reading in a match which ended 4–3. After the match, he came in for criticism by former United goalkeeper Alex Stepney, who said that he lacks "authority at the back". After a long period on the bench as an understudy to De Gea, and with United having already secured the Premier League title a month earlier, Lindegaard started in goal for Sir Alex Ferguson's final game as United manager against West Brom at The Hawthorns; the match finished 5–5. That appearance was Lindegaard's tenth of the season, thus qualifying him to receive a Premier League winner's medal.

In 2013–14, Lindegaard made just three appearances for the Manchester United first team – against Norwich in the League Cup, Swansea City in the FA Cup and Newcastle in the Premier League– keeping clean sheets against Norwich and Newcastle.

On 31 August 2015, Lindegaard joined West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract.

On 23 January 2016, Lindegaard joined Championship side Preston North End on loan for the remainder of the 2015–16 season. He made his debut on 2 February where he kept a clean sheet against Derby County. He was voted Man of the Match on his home debut, against Huddersfield Town.

On 2 July 2016, Lindegaard signed a one-year permanent deal with Preston North End after the mutual termination of his West Brom contract.

On 21 September 2017, Lindegaard joined Premier League side Burnley on a free transfer. He made his Burnley debut as a substitute for the injured Nick Pope during the Europa League second qualifying round on 26 July 2018.

Lindegaard has represented Denmark at under-19, under-20 and senior level. He made his debut for the U-19s in September 2002, and played a 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification 1–0 win over Switzerland on 13 October 2002. He played a total six youth international games until September 2003.

Lindegaard made his senior international debut in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Iceland on 7 September 2010, which Denmark won 1–0. On 8 October 2010, Denmark faced Portugal in another Euro 2012 qualifier. Early on in the game, with Denmark trailing 2–0, an injury sustained by starting goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen brought Lindegaard into action. He made many saves to keep his team in the game, but conceded a goal in the 85th minute to Cristiano Ronaldo with the match finishing 3–1 in Portugal's favour. Lindegaard started the following Euro 2012 qualifier against Cyprus, in which he kept a clean sheet as Denmark won 2–0. He was expected to feature for Denmark at the Euro 2012 finals but due to injuries while playing for his club and lack of proper game time post-recovery, his national teammate Stephan Andersen took over after normal second-choice goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen was injured in a pre-tournament friendly against Brazil.

Stephen Ward

Stephen Thomas Ward (19 October 1912 – 3 August 1963) was an English osteopath and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, a British political scandal which brought about the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and contributed to the defeat of the Conservative government a year later.

In 1945 Ward began practising osteopathy in London, and rapidly became successful and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time he also studied at the Slade School, and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Among these was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, embarked on a brief affair with Keeler, most of their assignations taking place in Ward's home in Wimpole Mews.

Ward's friendship with the Russian military attaché Yevgeny Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended the relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons, but a few weeks later admitted his affair. He resigned his ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership of the Privy Council. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963 he was charged with immorality offences and committed to trial.

In the trial that followed, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off immoral earnings. However, before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014 the trial verdict was put under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Born in Lemsford, Hertfordshire, Stephen Ward was the second son of Arthur Evelyn Ward, Vicar of Lemsford, and Eileen Esmée, daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors. The Ward family had a military and clerical background; the Vigors family were of distinguished Anglo-Irish stock. The explorer Wilfred Thesiger was a cousin- his father, Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger, son of Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, married Eileen's elder sister, Kathleen. Stephen's siblings were John (b. 1911), Raymond (b. 1916), and twins Bridget and Eileen (b. 1925). In 1920, the family moved to Twickenham, where Arthur Ward served as vicar of Holy Trinity Church, then in 1922 to Torquay in Devon, when he became Vicar of St. Matthias. Arthur Ward later became a Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and, in 1934, a Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral.

Ward was educated at Canford School, in the village of Canford Magna (near the market town of Wimborne Minster) in Dorset, as a boarder, where he was punished for an assault on a fellow-pupil after refusing to name the real culprit. This experience left a longstanding mark. Somewhat lazy and a regular underachiever, he had few realistic career choices when he left Canford in 1929. In his early twenties, he studied at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery, now known as the A.T. Still University of Health Sciences (ATSU) in Missouri, in the United States.

Ward moved to London, where he worked for a few months as a carpet salesman in Houndsditch before an uncle found him a job in Hamburg as a translator in the German branch of Shell Oil. After a year, he left the Hamburg job for Paris and registered for a course at the Sorbonne, while eking out a living as a tour guide. He returned briefly to Torquay in 1932 before moving again to London where he worked as a tea salesman. 

In 1934, he was persuaded by his mother to seek qualification as an osteopath, by studying at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery in Missouri, USA. He spent four years there, completing a demanding course that qualified him as a general medical practitioner in the United States. Ward was greatly impressed by the United States. He later commented: "I loved America and Americans, a warm-hearted, open and dynamic people. Their kindness and hospitality made me feel ashamed of the standoffish way the British treat people."

On his return from the United States, Ward set up as an osteopath in Torquay. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, he volunteered for service in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) but was rejected because his American qualifications were not recognised. In 1941, he was conscripted as a private into the Royal Armoured Corps, based at Bovington. His osteopathic skills became known; and, for much of his time at Bovington, he was relieved from general duties and permitted to practise his profession. This arrangement offended the RAMC; and, after an inquiry, Ward's activities were stopped. However, in view of his evident talents, he was recommended for a commission in the RAMC within the new category of "stretcher-bearer". On 19 June 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the non-medical section of the RAMC. 

In March 1944, Ward was posted to India. The army still found it difficult to accommodate him; and he spent much time canvassing for the proper recognition of osteopathy, while being officially assigned to non-medical duties. However, he found opportunities to practise his skills; among those whom he treated was Mahatma Gandhi, who impressed Ward: "Although much of his policy was opposed to that of my own country. I knew that when I was with him I was in the presence of greatness, and my encounter with him was certainly the most important meeting of my life". Following a nervous collapse that led to a period in a psychiatric hospital, Ward returned to England in October 1945 and was discharged from the army "on grounds of disability".

After the Second World War, Ward worked for the Osteopathic Association Clinic in Dorset Square, London. While there he had opportunities to treat well-known public figures, the first of whom was the American ambassador, W. Averell Harriman. Later he treated Duncan Sandys, the son-in-law of Winston Churchill; Sandys recommended Ward to Churchill himself. Ward now had sufficient status and recommendations to set up his own private practice, in Cavendish Square just off Harley Street. He soon attracted a clientele from the worlds of politics, society and show business, and his social life became absorbed into this milieu; Ward's polished manners and conversational skills assured him of social success. He befriended the cartoonist and socialite Arthur Ferrier, whose parties he attended regularly and where he mixed with, among others, Prince Philip of Greece, later the Duke of Edinburgh but then a junior officer in the Royal Navy. His own parties were noted for their social mix: "a barrister, a barrow-boy, a writer, a motor salesman, a peer, and always, for some reason, a steady stream of pretty girls".

Ward enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but his libido was low and his relationships were often platonic. His preference was for the type he called "alley-cats" – city girls that he could impress and dominate. He generally enjoyed discussing and watching sexual activity rather than participating, a factor which may have contributed to the failure of his marriage, on 27 July 1949, to an actress, Patricia Mary Baines, who came from a prosperous middle-class background.

Throughout the 1950s Ward's practice grew. Among his new patients was Lord Astor who became a close friend and who helped Ward to cement his place in London society. In return, Ward introduced the shy Astor to his own world of night-clubs, parties and girls. In 1956, for a nominal rent, Astor gave Ward the use of a riverside cottage in his grounds of the Astor family estate at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire. Many of Ward's assorted friends from all walks of life joined him for weekends at the cottage, where from time to time they would be joined by Astor and his guests from the main house. Sometimes Ward and his party would mingle with the gatherings at the main house.

In his spare time Ward had attended art classes at the Slade school, and subsequently he developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 he was commissioned by "The Illustrated London News" to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the Royal family, among them Prince Philip and Princess Margaret. Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Soviet leaders; to help him, one of his patients, the "Daily Telegraph" editor Sir Colin Coote, arranged an introduction to Yevgeny Ivanov, listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy. British Intelligence (MI5) knew from the Soviet double-agent Oleg Penkovsky that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Russian GRU. Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, and sometimes joined Ward's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.

MI5 considered Ivanov a possible defector, and sought Ward's help to this end, allocating him to a case officer known as "Woods". Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a backchannel, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union, and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

In 1959 Ward met Christine Keeler, a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho. Captivated by his charm, she agreed to move in with him, although their relationship was not sexual. She stayed with him, on and off, for the next several years, and often spent time at the riverside cottage. During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests at the cottage with Ward. At the main house, among a large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts, was John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and his wife, the actress Valerie Hobson. 

On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Ward introduced Keeler to Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her, and promised to be in touch. Ward later reported to MI5 that Profumo and Ivanov had met, and that Profumo had shown considerable interest in Keeler. This information was an unwelcome complication in MI5's plans to use her in a honeytrap operation against Ivanov, that might secure his defection.

Keeler and Profumo embarked on a brief affair; some suggest that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. The couple usually met at Ward's house in Wimpole Mews; Profumo did not pay Keeler for her services, apart from a few small presents and once, a sum of £20 as a gift for her mother. On 9 August 1961 Profumo was warned by Sir Norman Brook, the Cabinet Secretary, of the dangers of mixing with Ward's group, since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward's dependability. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning "Darling...", cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association; Keeler insists that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.

Press and public remained largely ignorant of the Keeler-Profumo liaison until early in 1963, when Keeler became a focus of newspaper attention as the "missing witness" in a case involving one of her former lovers, Johnny Edgecombe. At that point Keeler began talking indiscriminately, and attempted to sell her story to newspapers. None at this stage dared print it, but rumours of the affair were widespread, and there was much speculation. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine "Private Eye" printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: "Mr James Montesi", "Miss Gaye Funloving", "Dr Spook" and "Vladimir Bolokhov". 

In a statement to the House of Commons on 22 March 1963, Profumo denied any impropriety with Keeler. Ward, who knew the truth, at first supported Profumo; however, when he found himself the target of an aggressive police investigation, and facing immorality charges, he revealed his knowledge to Profumo's political masters and to the press. Profumo found the burden of sustaining his lie too much, confessed his guilt and resigned from government and parliament. Two days after the resignation, amid growing rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, Ward was arrested and charged with several counts of living off immoral earnings and of procuring.

Ward's committal proceedings began on 28 June, at Marylebone magistrates' court, where the Crown's evidence was fully reported in the press. Ward was committed for trial at the Old Bailey, but was released on bail pending trial. In his account of the trial, which began on 22 July, Richard Davenport-Hines describes it as an act of political revenge: "The exorcism of scandal in high places required the façade of [Ward's] conviction on vice charges". While living with Ward, Keeler and her fellow-model Mandy Rice-Davies had made small contributions to household expenses, and had repaid money lent to them by Ward. The thrust of the prosecution's case, in which Keeler and Rice-Davies were their principal witnesses, was that these payments indicated that Ward was living off their immoral earnings. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time.

The prosecution's case looked weak; however, Ward's perceived image had been heavily tarnished in the committal proceeding. None of his well-known friends offered to speak on his behalf, and MI5 did not reveal the uses they had made of Ward as a channel of communication to the Russians. The prosecuting counsel, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, portrayed Ward as representing "the very depths of lechery and depravity", while the judge, Sir Archie Marshall, adopted a similarly hostile attitude. 

Ward was represented by James Burge.

Towards the end of the trial, information relating to another case, in which Keeler had been a leading witness, was revealed by the Court of Appeal. This indicated that Keeler's evidence in that earlier case had been false. Marshall did not reveal the salient fact to the Ward trial jury that the reliability of the prosecution's chief witness had been compromised, and effectively invited the jury to disregard the appeal court's decision. On 30 July Marshall began his summing-up, in a speech that was so damning that Ward despaired. That evening, after writing numerous letters to friends and to the authorities, Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day Marshall completed his summing-up; the jury found Ward guilty "in absentia" on the charges of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and Rice-Davies, while acquitting him of several other counts. Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness.

On 9 August, a coroner's jury ruled Ward's death a suicide by barbiturate poisoning. According to reports, Ward left several notes, one of which read, "I'm sorry to disappoint the vulture [...] I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face it." On the day of the inquest, after a private memorial service at the chapel in St Stephen's Hospital, Ward's remains were cremated at Mortlake Crematorium. In their accounts of the security aspects of the Profumo affair, Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril provide extra information concerning Ward's last hours, his movements and his visitors. They also quote from an interview with "a former MI6 operative", who asserted that Ward had been murdered by an agent working on behalf of MI6. The main motive for the killing was Ward's continuing ability to embarrass the government and the Royal family. The method, apparently, was to encourage Ward to continue to take barbiturates until a fatal dose had been ingested. The reporter Tom Mangold, one of the last to see Ward alive, dismisses the murder theory, while allowing that there are unexplained circumstances relating to Ward's death.

The government appointed Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, to investigate the various rumours that had emanated from and around the Profumo affair. Denning's report, published on 26 September 1963, concluded that there had been no security leaks, and no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals. He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an "utterly immoral" man whose diplomatic activities were "misconceived and misdirected". The Profumo affair had damaged Harold Macmillan's government; Macmillan resigned as prime minister in October 1963, citing health reasons. His successor was Lord Home, who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election the Conservative government was narrowly defeated by the Labour Party, and Harold Wilson became prime minister.

Ward's role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982, when the "Sunday Times" located his former contact, "Woods". Keeler, in one of several accounts of her life, has denounced Ward as a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside Philby, Burgess and Maclean, but without direct supporting evidence. Many commentators share Davenport-Hines's view that Ward was a scapegoat and that his trial was an "historical injustice". The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up. Above all, the judge failed to disclose Keeler's perjury at an earlier trial, which made her a tainted witness. In January 2014 the case came under consideration by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, but in 2017 the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, one factor being the unavailability of a full transcript of the trial. 

In the 1989 film version of the Profumo affair, "Scandal", Ward is played by John Hurt. Ward was portrayed by Alexander Hanson in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Stephen Ward the Musical", which opened in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013 and closed in 2014. According to Geoffrey Robertson, the script of the musical is "remarkably faithful to the facts".

Aaron Lennon

Aaron Justin Lennon (born 16 April 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League club Burnley.

He began his career at hometown club Leeds United, making his first-team debut in 2003 and becoming the youngest player to play in the Premier League at that time. In 2005, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur for £1 million, where he made 364 appearances across all competitions and scored 30 goals. In 2008, Lennon won his first major honour, the Football League Cup, as Tottenham emerged victorious with a 2–1 win over London rivals Chelsea. In September 2015, he joined Everton for £4.5 million, after his successful spell with the club on loan.

Lennon made his senior debut for the English national team in 2006, and has been selected by England for two World Cups.

Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Lennon has one older brother and a younger sister and brother and is of Irish and Jamaican heritage. He attended City of Leeds High School, but then attended Boston Spa School due to the fact that the school was closer to Thorp Arch so it was easier for him to focus on both GCSEs and his football career. He was first spotted by scouts when he was eight years old; his older brother Anthony played for Manchester United's youth team.

In 2001, Lennon joined the Leeds United Academy. He set a record as the youngest player ever to have his boots sponsored when he signed up with Adidas at the age of just 14. Two years later, he began his professional career at Leeds United, where he became the youngest player to appear in the Premier League at the age of 16 years and 129 days, coming off the bench at White Hart Lane against Tottenham Hotspur in a 2–1 loss in August 2003.

Lennon scored his only goal for Leeds against Sunderland on Boxing Day 2004 during a 3–2 win. Lennon had been featuring from the bench up until that point, but he soon took his chance when John Oster was sacked for bad behaviour, becoming a regular starter from then on. His pace and skills on the wing excited Leeds fans, and he was one of the star performers in Leeds' first season in the Championship under the management of Kevin Blackwell with his performances earning rave reviews.

His last involvement at Leeds was playing and scoring in Lucas Radebe's testimonial. With Leeds' financial problems, Lennon was sold to Spurs for a heavily reduced fee, with a sell-on clause inserted into the deal.

With Leeds suffering financial difficulties, Lennon made a £1 million move to Tottenham Hotspur on 15 June 2005. His Spurs debut came a couple of months later in a 2–0 home defeat against Chelsea on 27 August 2005. On 18 March 2006, Lennon scored his first Premier League goal in Tottenham's 2–0 victory over Birmingham City at St. Andrew's.

He was nominated by fellow players for the PFA Young Player of the Year for both the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, but lost out to Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, respectively. Lennon signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with Tottenham on 8 January 2007.

On 24 February 2008, Lennon won his first major career honour as Tottenham came from a goal down to defeat Chelsea 2–1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium in the 2008 League Cup Final.

An improved deal was signed in March 2009 which contracted him to Spurs until 2014. Lennon finished the 2008–09 season as the Tottenham Fans' Player of the Season, the club's Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season, and was nominated for a third successive year for PFA Young Player of the Year, this time losing out to Ashley Young. He played in 47 matches in all competitions and scored five goals, including a late equaliser in a memorable North London derby which ended 4–4 and was manager Harry Redknapp's first match in charge. Spurs finished eighth in the league and reached the 2009 League Cup Final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United after a goalless draw at Wembley Stadium.

His goals early in the 2009–10 season – against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground, and Birmingham City – kept Tottenham at the top of the league table with four successive wins, their best start to a league season since the 1960–61 season. On 24 October 2009, Lennon was injured in a match against Stoke City. Tottenham were consequently reduced to ten men as manager Harry Redknapp had used all three available substitutes and they would go on to lose the match 1–0. He returned on 22 November in a 9–1 victory against Wigan Athletic and provided three assists and scored one goal. He was substituted in the 79th minute for David Bentley, receiving a standing ovation from the fans at White Hart Lane.

Lennon suffered a groin injury in December 2009 which kept him out of the team during the first months of 2010 and in the run up to the 2010 World Cup. He made his return from injury in a 3–1 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 24 April 2010, appearing as a second-half substitute.

On 28 November 2010, he scored a last minute winner in a 2–1 victory against Liverpool at White Hart Lane after a Benoît Assou-Ekotto long ball. On 15 February 2011, Lennon went on a blistering run as Tottenham counter-attacked and then delivered a perfect pass to assist Peter Crouch in a 1–0 win over A.C. Milan at the San Siro in the Round of 16 of the Champions League.

On 18 August 2011, Lennon scored in a 5–0 win against Hearts in a Europa League play-off tie. He scored his first league goal of the season against Fulham at Craven Cottage. In December, he scored his second goal of the season in a 3–0 win against Bolton at White Hart Lane. His next goal came on 11 January 2012 in a 2–0 home win against Everton.

On 1 September 2012, he signed a four-year deal keeping him at the club until 2016. Following that, he was named captain for the first time for a Europa League match against Lazio on 20 September 2012 which ended in a 0–0 draw. Lennon scored four goals during the 2012–13 season as Spurs finished in fifth place in the Premier League.

On 2 February 2015, Lennon was loaned to fellow Premier League club Everton for the remainder of the season. He made his debut for the club as a substitute in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool on 7 February. He scored his first goal for Everton in a 2–1 win against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on 22 March 2015.

He returned to Spurs briefly, for the beginning of the 2015–16 season, but was sent to train with the Under-21 squad and was not given a squad number. On 1 September 2015, Lennon rejoined Everton permanently on a three-year deal for a reported fee of £4.5 million. He began 2016 in a rich vein of form, scoring in a 1–1 draw at home to former club Tottenham, and in three successive Everton wins in late January and early February. Lennon continued his scoring run in a 3–1 away win at Aston Villa and he also netted in a 3–2 home loss to West Ham United on 5 March. However, this form proved to be short-lived as results for the team worsened and a poor end to the season led to the sacking of manager Roberto Martínez.

The new season had a more frustrating feel as Lennon found himself well down the pecking order when new boss Ronald Koeman took charge of the club. Lennon had played just 14 minutes of football during the first two months of Everton's league campaign with his first league start coming on 19 November 2016 in a home match against Swansea City.

On 23 January 2018, Lennon signed for Premier League club Burnley for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

Lennon was called up to the England U21 team for the first time in October 2005 and on 8 May 2006, he was picked in England's 2006 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being only 19 years of age and uncapped at senior level.

He was named man of the match in the England B encounter against Belarus on 25 May 2006 in England's World Cup warm-up match at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, which England B ultimately lost 2–1. He made his full England debut as a second-half substitute in the 6–0 win over Jamaica on 3 June.

Lennon appeared as a second-half substitute for England in their 2006 World Cup group stage match against Trinidad and Tobago (his first World Cup finals appearance). England scored twice following his and Wayne Rooney's arrival on the field, winning the match 2–0. Lennon then played in the quarter-final match against Portugal, coming on as a substitute for the injured David Beckham. Lennon was then himself substituted for Jamie Carragher immediately prior to a penalty shootout, in which England lost.

Lennon also came on as a substitute during a 5–0 Euro 2008 qualifying victory over Andorra on 2 September 2006 and made an instant impact by assisting Peter Crouch's second goal after receiving the ball for the first time. He made his first start for England in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Israel in March 2007 and was also selected in the first XI for the following match against Andorra. This proved to be Lennon's last appearance for exactly two years as it wasn't until 28 March 2009 that he was selected again by England, starting in a friendly match with Slovakia at Wembley Stadium. Lennon started again for England when they played Ukraine on 1 April 2009 at Wembley Stadium.

He was called up for the friendly against Slovenia and the World Cup qualifier versus Croatia, following his fine form for Tottenham, and was named man of the match in the 5–1 win over Croatia, their biggest defeat.

Lennon was named in manager Fabio Capello's 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the tournament in South Africa, he started in England's opening two fixtures; the 1–1 draw against the United States and in the 0–0 draw with Algeria.

On 30 April 2017, Lennon was detained under the Mental Health Act 2007. He was taken to hospital "for assessment" after police were called to reports of danger to a man's life in Salford. Lennon was said to be "receiving care and treatment for a stress-related illness", Everton reported.

In March 2019 he spoke about the incident, and said that other players had asked him for advice.

Phil Bardsley

Phillip Anthony Bardsley (born 28 June 1985) is a professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Burnley and the Scotland national team. Although born in England, Bardsley qualifies for Scotland through his Glasgow-born father.

Bardsley began his career with Manchester United where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including Royal Antwerp, Burnley, Rangers, Aston Villa and Sheffield United.

He joined Sunderland in January 2008 for an initial fee of £850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the Stadium of Light under Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill and he won the player of the year award in 2010–11. He lost his place in the team in 2012–13 after a falling-out with manager Paolo Di Canio, before returning to the first team under Gus Poyet. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in 2013–14 and reach the 2014 Football League Cup Final, in which they lost 3–1 to Manchester City.

After his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined Stoke City on a free transfer. He spent three seasons with the club before joining Burnley in July 2017.

Bardsley attended Hope High School in his hometown, Salford, along with former United teammates Mark Redshaw and Mark Howard. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United. He grew up near Manchester United's old training ground, The Cliff, and would often go there on his school holidays to see the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.

After coming through the club's youth system, Bardsley was a regular in Manchester United's under-17 team from the 2000–01 season, before progressing to the under-19s from the 2002–03 season. He continued in the under-19s in 2003–04, but appeared more frequently in the reserves before making his first-team debut in a 2–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 3 December 2003 in the fourth round of the League Cup. He made a second appearance for the first team in the 3–0 FA Cup fourth round win over Northampton Town on 25 January 2004, before going on a four-month loan to Manchester United's Belgian feeder club, Royal Antwerp, on 30 January. He made six appearances for Royal Antwerp, including a 4–0 defeat to Club Brugge on 8 February 2004, in which he was sent off for two bookable offences.

After returning to Manchester United at the end of 2003–04, Bardsley made three appearances on the club's 2004–05 pre-season tour of the United States, playing against Bayern Munich, Celtic and Milan. He made another promising start to the 2005–06 season, and an injury to Gary Neville gave him plenty of opportunities to play between August and November 2005. He was regularly named as a substitute for much of the rest of the season, before going on loan to Championship club Burnley on 16 March 2006. He played six matches and scored an own goal in the first minute of a 1–1 draw at home to Southampton.

Bardsley again made a significant contribution to Manchester United's pre-season programme in 2006–07, but on 16 August, he was sent out on loan again, this time to Scottish Premier League club Rangers. On 9 September 2006, he scored his only goal for Rangers against Falkirk with a terrific long-range free kick. He was sent off against Hibernian, and therefore missed the Old Firm match against Celtic. On 17 October, it was reported that Bardsley was involved in a training ground disagreement with manager Paul Le Guen and his future at Rangers appeared to be in doubt. Indeed, Bardsley never played for Rangers again and returned to Manchester United in December.

On 8 January 2007, Bardsley joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season and played his first Premier League match against Watford on 20 January. It was announced on 1 May that Bardsley would be returning to Manchester United when his loan deal with Villa ran out as manager Martin O'Neill did not want to make the move permanent.

After playing what would turn out to be his last match for the Manchester United first team against Coventry City in the League Cup on 26 September 2007, it was confirmed on 15 October Bardsley would join Sheffield United on loan until January 2008. He made his full debut for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 draw with Preston North End at Bramall Lane. Despite Sheffield United agreeing a deal with Manchester United to sign him permanently, Bardsley left at the end of his loan deal in January 2008 after playing 16 matches.

On 22 January 2008, Bardsley joined Sunderland on a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth an initial £850,000, potentially rising to £2 million. He made his debut in a 2–0 win against Birmingham City in the Premier League on 29 January. Bardsley played 11 times under Roy Keane in 2007–08 as Sunderland successfully avoided relegation by three points. On 27 August 2008 Bardsley scored his first goal in English football in a 2–1 victory against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup. Bardsley lost out to Pascal Chimbonda during the first half of the 2008–09 campaign before regaining his place in the team in November 2008. He retained his place under Ricky Sbragia, playing in total 33 times in 2008–09 as Sunderland survived relegation on the final day of the season.
Bardsley kept his place under new manager Steve Bruce for the first half of the 2009–10 season until loan signing Alan Hutton took his place in February 2010. From there until the end of the campaign Bardsley was mainly used as a substitute and due his lack of playing time, Bardsley stated that he may have to consider leaving. However Hutton didn't make his move permanent and Bardsley was able to reclaim his place in the side and in November 2010, he signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal running until summer 2014. He scored his first league goal against Aston Villa on 5 January 2011 with a 25-yard strike in a 1–0 win. He then scored his second of the season with another long range strike against Chelsea on 1 February 2012 in a 4–2 defeat. He scored another long-range goal on 9 April 2011 in a 3–2 defeat against West Bromwich Albion. In total Bardsley played 37 times in 2010–11 as the Black Cats finished in 10th position. Bardsley's consistent performances during the campaign earned him the Player of the year award.

Bardsley made a poor start to the 2011–12 season as he was sent-off in a 1–0 defeat against rivals Newcastle United on 21 August 2011. He was then handed a retrospective four-match ban by the FA for an altercation Juan Mata in a 2–1 defeat by Chelsea on 10 September 2011. Despite this Bardsley retained his place in the side under Martin O'Neill, playing a total of 37 matches as Sunderland finished in 13th position. He missed the start of the 2012–13 campaign after undergoing ankle surgery in August 2012. Bardsley returned to the side at the end of October 2012, with the team struggling near the bottom of the table. Paolo Di Canio replaced O'Neill in March 2013 and he guided the team to back to back victories over Newcastle United and Everton lifting the club away from the relegation zone. Bardsley scored in the penultimate match of the season in a 1–1 draw with Southampton on 12 May 2013. Bardsley missed the final match of the season away at Tottenham Hotspur after he and Matthew Kilgallon were pictured visiting a casino, angering Di Canio who vowed never to play the pair again. Di Canio also fined Bardsley as well as six other Sunderland players for "indiscipline" which prompted an investigation by the PFA.

Bardsley began the 2013–14 season playing with the under-21s and whilst playing against Bolton Wanderers on 12 August 2013 he broke his foot ending Di Canio's attempts to sell him. On 20 August 2013, Bardsley was suspended by Sunderland after mocking the club's opening day defeat to Fulham on a social media site. His suspension was lifted on 4 September 2013 after he apologised. Di Canio was sacked and replaced by Gus Poyet in October 2013 and brought Bardsley back into the first-team. He made a poor start on his return, scoring an own goal in a 4–0 defeat away at Swansea City. His form improved thereafter scoring against Southampton in the League Cup and the only goal in a 1–0 win over Manchester City on 10 November 2013. He scored against his former club Manchester United in the 2nd leg of the League Cup semi-final as Sunderland progressed to the final on penalties. Bardsley played the full match of the 2014 Football League Cup Final as Sunderland lost 3–1 to Manchester City. Bardsley played a total of 33 times in 2013–14 as Sunderland finished in 14th position.

With Bardsley's Sunderland contract due to expire at the end of June 2014, other clubs were free to approach him from January 2014. On 22 May 2014, Bardsley signed a three-year contract with Stoke City. He made his Premier League debut for Stoke on the opening day of the 2014–15 season in a 1–0 defeat against Aston Villa. Bardsley established himself as a regular under Mark Hughes but struggled with discipline, picking up nine yellow cards by March 2015. Bardsley played 30 times for Stoke in the 2014–15 season as Stoke finished in 9th position.

Bardsley lost his place in the Stoke squad for the 2015–16 season following the arrival of Glen Johnson from Liverpool. Despite missing out on league appearances Bardsley played a part in Stoke's League Cup campaign. He was sent-off in the fourth round against Chelsea and scored a 30-yard free kick in the quarter final victory over Sheffield Wednesday. Following injury to Johnson in February, Bardsley took his place back in the side until the end of the season. He made 17 appearances for Stoke in 2015–16 as Stoke again finished in 9th position.

Bardsley scored a rare goal in a 4–0 EFL Cup victory over Stevenage on 23 August 2016. He suffered a knee injury on November which ruled him out for three months. He returned to the side in February but after getting sent-off against Chelsea on 18 March 2017 he was unable to get back into the team. Speaking in April 2017 Bardsley revealed that he is in limbo over whether he will be offered a new contract. Bardsley played 16 times in 2016–17 as Stoke finished in 13th position. He signed a contract extension with Stoke on 26 May 2017.

On 25 July 2017, Bardsley completed a transfer to Premier League club Burnley, signing a two-year contract.

On 6 October 2010, Bardsley received a call-up for the Scotland national team for the Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic on 8 October 2010. He qualifies because his father was born in Glasgow. He made his debut on 11 October 2010 in a 3–2 defeat by World and European champions Spain, filling in for the injured Alan Hutton.

Bardsley plays at right back and describes himself as a modern full-back.— "Since I started playing professionally, the game has changed and you have to be really, really fit because a full-back is expected to get up and down the pitch. I like to defend and be aggressive, but also get forward to create chances and create goals, it's all part of being a modern-day full-back."

In May 2017, Bardsley took a UEFA B Licence course with the Irish Football Association.

Bardsley married glamour model Tanya Robinson in 2014, with whom he has three children. Bardsley's grandfather, John Lancaster, died in a car crash in October 2016.

Matěj Vydra

Matěj Vydra (, born 1 May 1992) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Burnley and the Czech Republic national team.

He has previously played for FC Chotěboř, Vysočina Jihlava, Baník Ostrava, Club Brugge, Udinese and Watford. He has also spent two loan spells at Watford.

Vydra joined Baník Ostrava from Vysočina Jihlava in January 2010 at the age of 17 for 20 million CZK (€765,000). He spent six months at Baník Ostrava, where he scored four goals in 14 matches.

In June 2010, Vydra moved to Serie A side Udinese and was also voted by sports journalists the Czech Revelation of the Year for his performances at Baník Ostrava in the 2009–10 season. He joined Club Brugge on loan in August 2011 but returned to Udinese having played just two games due to an injury.

In July 2012, it was confirmed he had been loaned to Watford for the 2012–13 season. Vydra scored his first goal for Watford when he netted the winner against Crystal Palace on 18 August 2012, in a game which finished 3–2.

He scored a goal against Leeds United on 10 November. Vydra then scored goals in successive matches in a 2–0 win against Nottingham Forest on 22 December 2012 and in a 3–1 away win over Brighton & Hove Albion on 29 December 2012. He scored another brace on 12 January 2013 against Middlesbrough. Vydra carried on his rich vein of form by netting another goal the week after, on 19 January 2013 against Huddersfield and then netted his third goal in as many games a week later, scoring twice on 26 January 2013 in a 3–0 win away to Nottingham Forest. He was in fine form, and netted another goal in his next start against Bolton on 2 February 2013. The match eventually finished 2–1 to Watford, with Vydra assisting Almen Abdi's winning goal. After three matches without a goal, Vydra netted his 20th goal of the campaign in a 2–1 win over Derby County on 23 February 2013.

On 25 March 2013 it was announced that he had won the 2012–13 Championship Player of the Season award in his first season in English football. Vydra won the award ahead of Glenn Murray of Crystal Palace and Blackpool's Thomas Ince. Despite going on a run in which he didn't score in 13 games, he went on to score twice in the semi-final of the end-of-season play-offs in a 3–2 aggregate win over Leicester. Vydra's season at Watford finished in disappointment as his club lost the chance to be promoted to the English top-flight after losing the play-off final against Crystal Palace and he injured his ankle during the match, having to be substituted at half time.

Vydra joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on a season-long loan deal on 13 August 2013. He scored his first goal for the club on 21 December 2013, equalising for West Brom in a 1–1 Premier League draw against Hull City. On 22 February 2014, Vydra scored his second goal for West Brom, equalising in a 1–1 draw against Fulham. His third goal for the club came in a 3–3 draw against Tottenham, with Vydra scoring the game's first goal after 28 seconds.

On 26 June 2014, Watford announced they had re-signed Vydra on a season-long loan from Udinese, with a view to a permanent move. Vydra made a scoring return as he netted in Watford's 3–0 opening day win over Bolton Wanderers on 9 August 2014. On 25 April, he came on as a substitute to score as Watford beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2–0 at the Falmer Stadium thus securing Watford's promotion back to the Premier League, thanks to other results going their way, with Vydra scoring 16 goals in the EFL Championship to help earn promotion.

Watford signed Vydra permanently in July 2015 with the player signing a five-year contract. He started the 2015–16 season behind Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney in the pecking order, on 25 August 2015, he played for Watford in a 1-0 loss against Preston in the EFL Cup.

On 1 September 2015, Reading signed Vydra on a season-long loan for a fee of £2.5 million with an option to sign him permanently for £10 million if promoted to the Premier League in the 2016–17 season. He made his Reading debut on 11 September 2015 in a 5-1 win against Ipswich Town. He scored his first goal for the club on 31 October in a 1-1 draw against Brighton.

On 19 January 2016 in a FA Cup Third Round Replay, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–2 comeback victory over Huddersfield Town. In total he scored 9 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for the club, finishing the clubs 2nd top scorer (behind Nick Blackman) for the 2015–16 season.

On 27 August 2016, Derby County announced that they had signed Watford striker Vydra on a four-year deal, for a fee reported at £8,000,000. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 loss to Blackburn Rovers on 24 September 2016. In his first Derby season he scored 5 goals, making 33 appearances in the EFL Championship with 13 of those coming as a substitute, with Vydra playing in different positions with the likes of Tom Ince, Darren Bent, Johnny Russell and David Nugent all competing for attacking position roles.

Vydra scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 3–0 away win over Middlesbrough on 25 November 2017. After the sale of previous season top scorer Tom Ince and the acquisitions of Strikers Sam Winnall and Cameron Jerome, Vydra found himself playing in his favoured second striker position behind a central striker of either Winnall, Jerome, David Nugent or Chris Martin His goals during the 2017–18 season helped Derby reach the playoff semi finals, where they were knocked out over two legs by Fulham.

In April 2018, he was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year and also in the EFL Championship Team Of The Year. He scored 22 goals in all competitions and received the Sky Bet Championship Golden Boot after scoring 21 goals in the Championship during the 2017–18 season. On 1 May, Vydra won 3 awards at the clubs end of season awards ceremony winning the Player Of The Year, Players Player Of The Year and the Jack Stamps Player Of The year awards.

In July 2018, Vydra held talks with fellow EFL Championship side Leeds United over a potential move. However, after weeks of negotiations, the move broke down over personal terms.

Burnley have signed Vydra for an undisclosed fee on a three year deal from Derby on 7 August 2018.

Vydra played for five Czech youth national teams between under-16 and under-21 levels. In August 2012 he was called up to the Czech senior team for the first time, for a World Cup qualifying match away to Denmark and a friendly match against Finland. Vydra played the first 73 minutes against Denmark, in a game that finished as a goalless draw. He scored his first goal, a header, for the national team on 26 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifier against Armenia, to open the scoring in a 3–0 victory. Vydra also scored the second goal of the game, robbing an Armenian defender of the ball before slotting past the keeper.

Adam Legzdins

Adam Richard Legzdins (born 28 November 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Burnley.

Legzdins began his career with Birmingham City, from where he spent time on loan at several lower-division clubs but never played first-team football for his parent club. In 2008, he joined Crewe Alexandra, with whom he made his debut in the Football League, but played only infrequently. He spent the 2010–11 season as Football League Two club Burton Albion's first-choice goalkeeper, earning himself a move to Derby County of the Football League Championship. He played 35 matches over three seasons with Derby, mainly in 2012–13, and after a year with Leyton Orient, he rejoined Birmingham City in 2015. After two seasons and 21 appearances, he signed for Burnley.

He qualifies to play international football for Latvia via his paternal grandparents.

Legzdins was born in Penkridge, Staffordshire. He came through Birmingham City's Academy system and played his first competitive football in October 2005 on loan at Alfreton Town in the Conference North, four games which included a man of the match performance away at Hereford United in the FA Cup. He then joined Halifax Town of the Conference National on a work experience basis, where he played 11 games before Birmingham recalled him, concerned that regular first-team football for Halifax combined with playing for Birmingham's reserve team was too much for the 19-year-old.

Legzdins signed his first one-year professional contract in the summer of 2006. Early in the 2006–07 he was given a Birmingham squad number because of an injury to first choice keeper Maik Taylor, and was an unused substitute in their Championship match at Cardiff City. In October 2006 he joined Oldham Athletic on loan where he acted as backup to Les Pogliacomi, making one substitute appearance in the Football League Trophy. He then joined Macclesfield Town on loan and was expected to go straight into the starting eleven due to injury and suspension, but manager Paul Ince chose goalkeeping coach David Rouse instead, and Legzdins completed his month's loan without appearing for the club. He played an active part in helping Birmingham reserves to the championship of the Central League Division One Central in 2006–07.

Legzdins was given a further year's contract in summer 2007, and rejoined Halifax on a three months' loan in October 2007, where he played regularly in preference to the more experienced Craig Mawson. He extended his loan at Halifax until the end of the 2007–08 season in January 2008, and on 9 June 2008 he signed for Crewe Alexandra as a replacement for their departing goalkeepers Ben Williams and Owain Fôn Williams. He joined Weymouth on a month's loan on 26 March 2009.

Legzdins made his first team debut for Crewe in the League Cup defeat to Blackpool on 11 August 2009, after loan goalkeeper David Button returned to Tottenham Hotspur, and followed this up with his debut in the Football League on 22 August, keeping a clean sheet in the 1–0 home win against Hereford United.

He rejected a new one-year contract with Crewe in May 2010 and subsequently signed for League Two team Burton Albion on a two-year contract on 1 July. He kept a clean sheet on his full debut on 7 August 2010 in a 0–0 draw against Oxford United. After playing in every League game of the 2010–11 season, he was voted Burton Albion Supporters' Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year.

After lengthy speculation, on 29 June 2011, it was confirmed that Burton and Championship outfit Derby County had agreed a transfer fee that would allow Legzdins to join the Pride Park club. The transfer was completed on 1 July; Legzdins signed a three-year contract. Derby manager Nigel Clough said that he would be backup to first choice keeper Frank Fielding. Legzdins made his debut for Derby away at Nottingham Forest after Fielding was sent off after only a minute, and contributed to a 2–1 win against their local rivals. On 20 March 2012, Legzdins rejoined former club Burton Albion on a month's emergency loan. He was restricted to just one appearance by a hip injury suffered in a 1–0 defeat against Northampton Town and returned to Derby on 17 April. He eventually made his third appearance for Derby four days later as a half-time substitute for Fielding away at Portsmouth; Derby won 2–1. He started the final game of the season, a 1–1 draw against Peterborough United.

Legzdins again started the season as second-choice goalkeeper. After Fielding picked a groin injury in October, Legzdins returned to the starting line-up and kept his place after Fielding regained fitness in November. He impressed Clough with his performances, especially in the 2–0 win at Bristol City which ended a run of seven consecutive games without a clean sheet and a run of four away defeats. Saves against Steve Davies and Liam Fontaine were picked out by Clough, with one from Fontaine described as one "down to pure size and presence, as well as quick feet to get across his line and block it. It was a very important save." Legzdins' run of 30 consecutive first-team starts ended in March 2013 when Clough felt the need for Fielding's greater experience ahead of Derby's 2–1 win against Leicester City. Five weeks later, Legzdins returned to first-team action after Fielding was sent off for a professional foul against Peterborough United, and he started the final two games of the season, ending the season with 33 first-team appearances. After Derby signed Burnley's Lee Grant in May, Legzdins was made available for transfer with a year left on his contract.

Legzdins was originally not given a squad number for the 2013–14 season, However, after featuring in first-team pre-season friendlies he was assigned the squad number 26 in late July and went into the season as second choice to Grant.

Legzdins signed for League One club Leyton Orient on 13 June 2014. He signed a two-year contract with the East London club after being released by Derby. He left the club by mutual consent on 1 June 2015 after his appearances during the 2014–15 season were restricted by injury.

Legzdins re-joined Birmingham City on 27 June 2015; he signed a two-year deal with the option of a further year. On the bench for the opening league match of the seasonTomasz Kuszczak startedLegzdins made his Birmingham debut three days later in a 2–1 League Cup win away to Bristol Rovers. He played in two more cup matches before finally making his League debut for Birmingham on 9 April 2016; he kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 win away to Reading, and finished the season with nine appearances, of which five were inn the league.

He made his first league appearance of the 2016–17 season when Kuszczak succumbed to a pre-existing injury during the warm-up before Birmingham's match away to Reading on 13 September; he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. He kept his place for the next seven matches, even after Kuszczak's return to fitness, but manager Gary Rowett brought Kuszczak back into the side for the local derby against Aston Villa. He made four more appearances in the second half of the season: two in the FA Cup, and two in the league, on both occasions as a half-time substitute for the injured Kuszczak. When Birmingham took up their option to extend his contract for a further year, Legzdins said he was "absolutely delighted" to accept, in preference to offers from elsewhere, "because everybody who knows me knows how much the club means to me."

The arrival of David Stockdale left Legzdins third in Birmingham's pecking order for 2017–18, and Premier League club Burnley were in need of a goalkeeper after Paul Robinson's retirement left them without sufficient backup for Tom Heaton. On 8 August 2017, Legzdins signed a three-year contract with Burnley; the fee was undisclosed.

Dan Agyei

Daniel Ebenezer Kwasi Agyei (born 1 June 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Burnley.

Agyei came through the ranks at AFC Wimbledon, scoring 35 goals for the club's under-21 team in the 2014–15 season to draw the attention of a host of top clubs, reportedly including West Ham United, Chelsea and Fulham. Agyei eventually signed for Burnley, on a long-term contract to initially play for the club's development squad.

After impressing for Burnley's development squad in the 2015/16 season and making his senior Burnley debut in a pre-season friendly against Bradford City, Agyei was made available for a loan move by manager Sean Dyche.

Nahki Wells

Nahki Michael Wells (born 1 June 1990) is a Bermudian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Queens Park Rangers, on loan from Burnley, and the Bermuda national team.

Wells began his career in his native Bermuda, playing for Dandy Town Hornets and Bermuda Hogges. After moving to England, where he had a brief spell in non-league football with Eccleshill United, Wells has since played in the Football League for Carlisle United, Bradford City and Huddersfield Town.

Wells was born in Hamilton. He began his career in his native Bermuda with the Dandy Town Hornets, a team he had first joined at the age of 12. Wells had a trial with Dutch club Ajax as a teenager; he was offered a contract but ultimately did not sign for the club. After spending the 2009–10 season with the senior team of the Dandy Town Hornets, scoring 20 goals, Wells spent the 2010 season in the USL PDL with the Bermuda Hogges, scoring 2 goals in 9 games.

Wells later moved to England to attend the Richmond International Academic & Soccer Academy in Leeds, and also played club football with local non-League team Eccleshill United. Wells underwent a trial with Carlisle United in November 2010, his second with the club. Before moving to the UK, Well has sought the advice of compatriot Shaun Goater. In December 2010, it was announced that Wells would sign for Carlisle United on 1 January 2011. Wells made his debut for Carlisle United on 15 January 2011, in a League One game against Bristol Rovers. In March 2011, Wells publicly announced his wish to play at Wembley Stadium with Carlisle United in the 2011 Football League Trophy Final, to be played in April 2011. However, Wells did not make the matchday squad, as Carlisle United beat Brentford 1–0.

On 3 May 2011, it was announced that Wells' contract with Carlisle United would not be renewed at the end of the season.

In late June 2011, Wells went on trial with Bradford City alongside four other players. He signed a one-year contract with Bradford City on 22 July 2011. Wells made his debut for Bradford City on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute for Mark Stewart. He scored his first goal for the Bantams in a 4–2 win against Barnet.

On 9 March 2012, Bradford City exercised an option in Wells' contract, and extended his deal by one year. On 14 April, he scored a hat-trick as Bradford beat Northampton Town 3–1. He was later named in the Football League Two Team of the Week for that week. Following this, former Bradford City player Dean Windass urged Wells to remain with the club, while ex-Bermudian international Kyle Lightbourne compared him to Jermain Defoe. In early May, Wells and Bradford City began discussions over a new four-year contract, and later that month he publicly assured fans that he would stay with the club. In June there were further rumours of Wells leaving the club, while it was later revealed that he nearly never signed for the club in the first place. In July, Wells stated he was in no rush to sign a new contract.

Wells scored a penalty on the opening day of the 2012–13 season in an away match against Gillingham. He scored his second goal of the season on 25 August in a 5–1 win against AFC Wimbledon, and also assisted the fifth goal, crossing for James Hanson to score with a header. In September 2012, Wells suffered a hip injury. On 25 September, Wells came off the bench to score two late goals to help Bradford overturn a 2–0 deficit against Burton Albion in the League Cup third round, with Bradford going on to win the game 3–2 in extra time. At the end of September 2012, Wells signed a new three-year contract with the club, in a move praised by Phil Parkinson, the club's manager. In October 2012, Wells was banned by the club from celebrating his goals. As the January 2013 transfer window opened, Bradford City dismissed rumours linking Wells with a move away from the club. On 8 January 2013, he helped Bradford beat Premier League side Aston Villa 3–1 in the first leg of the semi-final of the League Cup by opening the scoring in the 19th minute. After appearing in the 2013 League Cup Final, Wells became the first player from Bermuda to appear in an English major cup final. Although Wells did not complete the game, prior to the match he spoke about being motivated by the recent death of a friend in a motorcycle accident, as well as how he was looking forward to facing opponents from a higher league. Wells hadn't scored for the club since 2 February 2013, until he scored the only goal of the game on 6 April 2013, in a 1–0 home victory against Northampton Town. Later that month, he was linked with a transfer to Burnley.

In May 2013, Wells scored three goals across two legs to help Bradford City qualify for the League Two play-off final. The goals took his tally for the season to 25, a target he had set himself before the season begun. He then scored in the final against Northampton Town, which Bradford won 3–0 to earn promotion to League One. Following the promotion, Wells stated he wished to stay at the club, though the club later admitted they might sell the player if a suitable offer came in. Former City player John Hendrie advised Wells to remain at the club.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Wells spoke of his desire for another good cup run, and his belief that the club could achieve a second successive promotion. In June 2012, manager Phil Parkinson said that only a high-money bid would persuade the club to sell either Wells or fellow striker James Hanson. In July 2013, the club rejected a bid from Peterborough United, and later revealed that they had had no further offers for the player. In August 2013, Wells' strike partner Hanson spoke positively of his partnership with Wells. On 24 August 2013, Wells scored two goals in a home match against Sheffield United; in the process he set a new club record by scoring in his eighth consecutive match, a feat which was praised by teammate James Hanson. After the match the club re-stated that they would not sell Wells, and later confirmed they had not received any bids for the player on transfer deadline day. On 4 September 2013, Wells was nominated for the League One Player of the Month award, winning the award two days later. Wells has publicly praised his strike partnership with Hanson, as has journalist Simon Parker, who described them as "[one of] the best front pairs that League One has to offer." Of the 53 goals that Wells scored for Bradford City, 49 came when he was playing with Hanson.

In late September 2013 Wells suffered ankle ligament damage in a match, and was ruled out for a number of weeks. Manager Phil Parkinson stated he would not rush Wells back into play, Wells returned, after two months out, to score a hat-trick against Coventry City. In December 2013, club co-chairman Julian Rhodes admitted that the player might leave the club, as rumours surrounding the player's possible departure began to increase. That same month, colleague Andrew Davies described Wells and Hanson as the best strike pair in the division, and Davies also urged Wells to remain with the club, while manager Phil Parkinson said that he did not want the club to sell the player. Wells picked up an injury at the end of December 2013, and at the start of the January 2014 transfer window, manager Phil Parkinson said he wanted any transfer issues sorted quickly. The next day, 3 January 2014, the club announced that they had already rejected one offer for the player, after saying that Wells has been receiving interest from a number of Premier League clubs, as well as Championship side Burnley. The club also said they would lose £1 million for the 2013–14 season if they did not sell Wells. Despite all the speculation, Parkinson said he felt Wells would be able to ignore off-the-field matters and concentrate on his playing, though he later admitted that the player was being affected by the rumours.

On 10 January 2014, Wells signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Huddersfield Town after transferring for an undisclosed club record fee. The deal was initially completed a one-game loan deal, to allow time for the paperwork for the permanent move to be completed. Wells was criticised by a section for moving from Bradford City to a team considered a rival. On 11 January 2014, Wells made his Huddersfield Town debut, appearing as a substitute in the 55th minute, and scoring the winning goal in a 1–0 home victory against Millwall, less than 24 hours after joining the club.

Wells ended his first full-season with Huddersfield Town as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. At the end of the 2016–17 season, former club Bradford City received a £250,000 bonus payment following Huddersfield's promotion to the Premier League.

Wells, in the final year of his contract with Huddersfield, signed a three-year deal with Burnley for £5 million on 31 August 2017.

On 23 August 2018, Wells signed for Championship side Queens Park Rangers on a season-long loan. He scored his first goal for QPR against Sheffield Wednesday on 23 October 2018.

Wells made his international debut for Bermuda in 2007.

Wells also made four unofficial international appearances for Bermuda in the 2007 Island Games.

In late August 2011, Wells was recalled by Bermuda, joining their squad for FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in early September 2011. Wells appeared in five 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches for Bermuda, against Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.

Wells was described as "one of Bermuda's most promising players, with an exceptionally bright future" in February 2012 by then Sports Minister Glenn Blakeney, and was honoured by Premier Craig Cannonier in June 2013. He has been described as the country's "star footballer".

Jimmy Dunne

James Dunne (3 September 1905 – 14 November 1949) was an Irish footballer who played for, among others, Shamrock Rovers, Sheffield United, Arsenal and Southampton. Dunne was also a dual internationalist and played for both Ireland teams: the FAI XI and the IFA XI. Dunne holds the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football.

Dunne was the first Irishman to figure prominently in the English League scoring records. In the 1930–31 season he scored 41 league goals for Sheffield United. This became a club record and remains the most league goals scored by an Irishman during a single English League season.

In the 1931–32 season, he scored in 12 consecutive matches. This is the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football. Dunne also scored 30 or more First Division goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. He excelled at either centre forward or inside forward and was outstanding with his head. On 27 September 1930 he scored a hat-trick of headers against Portsmouth. He was a fringe member of the great Arsenal side of the 1930s before finishing his career at Shamrock Rovers.

Dunne died suddenly from a heart attack, at the age of 44, on 14 November 1949. His two sons, Tommy and Jimmy, also played in the League of Ireland for St. Patrick's Athletic. Tommy also played for Shamrock Rovers. His nephew, another Tommy Dunne, also played for Rovers and another nephew Christy Doyle, played for Shelbourne and the Republic of Ireland.

Dunne initially played junior football. However his career was put on hold during the Irish Civil War when he was interned by the Irish Free State authorities for alleged Republican sympathies. His brother, Christy, was an active Republican. He subsequently joined Shamrock Rovers and played a number of games for the club's senior team. A scout recommended him to New Brighton, then playing in the English Third Division North. Dunne joined New Brighton in November 1925 and made an instant impact, scoring six goals in eight league games.

Dunne soon attracted the interest of First Division side Sheffield United who signed him in February 1926 for £800. However this marked the start of another apprenticeship in the reserves. He made his first team debut in a 4–0 home win against Arsenal on 4 September 1926 but he struggled to hold a regular place and in his first three seasons played just eleven league games. His first goal came against Derby County on 15 October 1927. Dunne had to wait three years before he became an established member of the United team and at one stage they put him on the transfer list. It was not until the 1929–30 season that Dunne became a goalscoring sensation. His first hat-trick against Leicester City in a 3–3 draw on 7 September 1929 was followed by successive four-goal hauls against West Ham United on New Year's Day (4–2) and Leicester City (7–1) three days later. He scored another hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 3 March. He finished the season as the club's top goalscorer with 36 goals in 39 games and his goals helped United avoid relegation on goal average.

Dunne was subsequently top goalscorer at United for four consecutive seasons between 1929 and 1933. This included scoring over 30 First Division goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. His best season was 1930–31, when he scored 41 league goals plus a further nine in other competitions; his 41-goal haul remains the record tally in the English League by an Irishman. Dunne holds the all-time record of goals scored in consecutive matches at the elite level of English football: between 24 October 1931 and 1 January 1932, he scored in 12 games in succession.

Dunne's goalscoring form with Sheffield United soon attracted the interest of Arsenal. In early 1932 they offered United £10,000 for Dunne but were turned down. However, in September 1933, after United hit financial trouble, they accepted a reduced fee of £8,250. Dunne made his debut for Arsenal against Middlesbrough on 30 September 1933 in a 6–0 win, and went on to score 9 goals in 23 league games during the 1933–34 season, helping Arsenal win the First Division title. However, the arrival of Ted Drake in the summer of 1934 saw Dunne lose his place in the Arsenal first team, and he would only play another 8 games over the next two seasons. Dunne was dubbed "the most expensive reserve player in English football" in the press, although his Arsenal colleagues clearly recognised his talents, with Cliff Bastin remarking he was "one of the best five centre forwards I had ever seen".

In July 1936 Dunne signed for Southampton where he was nicknamed "Snowy" by the fans because of his fair hair. Described as "dangerous in the air (with) a short striding run which enabled him to retain his balance in quick moves near the goal", he was the Saints' leading scorer during the 1936–37 season, scoring 14 league goals in 36 games, helping Southampton to avoid relegation to the Third Division.

At the end of the season, Dunne turned down the opportunity to renew his contract at Southampton and opted to return to Shamrock Rovers. Eighteen months after leaving the club, Dunne was given a rousing salute by Southampton dockers as he passed through the port with the Ireland team.

In 1937 Dunne returned to Shamrock Rovers as player-manager and was the inspiration behind Rovers winning League of Ireland titles in 1938 and 1939. He won 9 caps during this spell at Milltown. He also helped Rovers win the FAI Cup in 1940. The reserves had won the Leinster Senior League Division 1 title that season and they were coached by Dunne whose first medal with Rovers was the Leinster Senior League Division 1.

On 31 August 1942 Rovers played Belfast Celtic in a testimonial for Dunne which ended in a 2–2 draw. Dunne went on to coach Bohemians between 1942 and 1947 before returning to Rovers once again.
When Dunne began his international career in 1928 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland – based IFA and the Irish Free State – based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Dunne, played for both teams.

Between 1928 and 1932 Dunne made 7 appearances and scored 4 goals for the IFA XI. Dunne made his debut for the IFA XI on 2 February 1928 in a 2–1 defeat against Wales. He won his second cap for the IFA XI on 20 October 1930 against England and scored in a 5–1 defeat. During 1931 he scored a further three goals for the IFA XI and as a result scored 4 goals in four consecutive appearances.
