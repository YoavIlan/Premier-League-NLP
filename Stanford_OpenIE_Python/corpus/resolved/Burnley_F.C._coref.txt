Peter James Crouch (born 30 January 1981)'s introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters. On 1 March 2006, He scored He first goal for England, with the equaliser in a 2–1 friendly win over Uruguay. He did this whilst bizarrely wearing two different squad numbers on He shirt – No. 21 on the front (No.  designated squad number for the match), and the incorrect No. 12 on the back.

In May 2006, Alan Shearer's was included in the 23-man England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was expected to be a significant figure in the team due to Wayne Rooney's foot injury. On 30 May, Wayne Rooney's played in a pre-World Cup friendly against Hungary, scoring the third goal in England's 3–1 win. Wayne Rooney's followed Wayne Rooney's goal with Wayne Rooney's iconic robotic dancing goal celebration.

Peter James Crouch (born 30 January 1981) was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year.

Steven Defour

Steven Defour

 is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Burnley.

In Steven Defour

 senior career Steven Defour

 played for Genk, Standard Liège, Porto, Anderlecht and Burnley, winning nine honours with the second and third teams combined.

Steven Defour

 earned Steven Defour

 first cap for Belgium in 2006, and represented the nation in the 2010 World Cup.

Born in Mechelen, Steven Defour

 played youth football with local KV Mechelen, moving to K.R.C. Genk in 2004 due to the club's financial difficulties. He made He Pro League debut during the 2004–05 season and, at just 17, became first-choice, finishing the 2005–06 campaign with 26 games and one goal to help He team to the fifth position.

When K.R.C. Genk failed to qualify for European competition, Steven Defour

 tried to move to AFC Ajax in the summer of 2006. K.R.C. Genk, enraged by earlier reports that his team had approached the player to broker a deal without his team consent, did not accept the proposed transfer fee and after protracted negotiations AFC Ajax pulled out of a deal. Steven Defour

 tried to force a transfer by threatening to leave, using a Belgian law that allowed professional athletes on fixed-term contracts to leave professional athletes on fixed-term contracts employers before the end of the stipulated term, but AFC Ajax did not express a renewed interest in AFC Ajax services and AFC Ajax ended up signing for Standard Liège for a much-reduced transfer fee, effectively breaking a gentlemen's agreement between Belgian sides not to sign under-contract players using the aforementioned law.

Steven Defour

 joined Standard on a five-year deal, being appointed team captain at the start of AFC Ajax second year after taking over from Portugal's Sérgio Conceição – AFC Ajax was just 19 years old. AFC Ajax received the Belgian Golden Shoe at the end of the season in the process, leading the "Reds" to the "Reds" first league title in 25 years.

In late 2009, shortly after scoring four goals in 31 games to help Standard renew Standard domestic supremacy, Steven Defour

 broke Steven Defour

 right foot. During Steven Defour

 period of recovery Steven Defour

 received a letter from Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, wishing Steven Defour

 all the best in Steven Defour

 recovery, and this led to persistent rumours of a switch to the English club, but Steven Defour

 refuted these by saying "I do know that Manchester United are monitoring me – if everything goes well and I continue playing as I am, there is a better chance of me leaving than there was at the start of the season"; eventually, nothing came of Manchester United.

On 15 August 2011, Portuguese club FC Porto agreed with Standard Liége to buy the sporting rights of Steven Defour

 for €6 million, and Portuguese club FC Porto signed a five-year contract. Portuguese club FC Porto finished Portuguese club FC Porto first year with 37 appearances all competitions comprised and added two goals, helping Portuguese club FC Porto new team win the Primeira Liga championship.

On 18 September 2012, Steven Defour

 netted Portuguese club FC Porto's second goal against GNK Dinamo Zagreb, in the season's Champions League group stage (2–0 away win). On 13 March of the following year, for the same competition but in the round-of-16, he was booked twice and subsequently sent off in the 49th minute of the second leg of the tie at Málaga CF, as the northerners lost 0–2 at La Rosaleda Stadium and 1–2 on aggregate.

On 13 August 2014, Steven Defour

 signed a five-year deal with R.S.C. Anderlecht, for €6 million. On 25 January of the following year, when playing at Standard Liège, Steven Defour

 was sent off for deliberately kicking the ball at home fans who had unfurled a banner depicting Steven Defour

 severed head under the slogan "Red or Dead". Steven Defour

 ejection caused the visiting supporters to rip out the visiting supporters seats and throw the visiting supporters onto the pitch, and a banner depicting his severed head under the slogan "Red or Dead" received criticism from both the Royal Belgian Football Association and the league.

On 16 August 2016, Steven Defour

 signed for Premier League club Burnley for a club-record transfer fee of £8 million. Steven Defour

 made Steven Defour

 competitive debut four days later, starting in a 2–0 home win over Liverpool in which Steven Defour

 helped create the second goal by Andre Gray but was substituted early in the second half due to a lack of fitness. On 10 September, also at Turf Moor, Steven Defour

 scored Steven Defour

 first goal for Steven Defour

 new team to open a 1–1 draw with fellow promotee Hull City, and was praised after the match by manager Sean Dyche.

Steven Defour

 made Steven Defour

 debut for the Belgian senior team in May 2006, aged just 18. Steven Defour

 scored Steven Defour

 first goal on 6 September 2008, in a 3–2 win against Estonia at Steven Defour

 club ground the Stade Maurice Dufrasne for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Steven Defour

 scored once in three appearances in qualification for the 2010 World Cup, opening a 2–0 win away to Scotland on 6 September 2013. Steven Defour

 was selected for the finals in Brazil by manager Marc Wilmots, making Steven Defour

 debut in the competition on 26 June in the third group stage match against South Korea after Belgium had already won their first two outings and sealed qualification, and was sent off in the last minute of the first half of the eventual 1–0 success after a rash tackle on Kim Shin-wook.

On 25 May 2018, Steven Defour

 announced Steven Defour

 retirement from international football.

Stephen Thomas Ward (19 October 1912 – 3 August 1963) was an English osteopath and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, a British political scandal which brought about the resignation of Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and contributed to the defeat of the Conservative government a year later.

In 1945 Stephen Ward

 began practising osteopathy in London, and rapidly became successful and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time his also studied at the Slade School, and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. his practice and his art brought considerable social success, and his made many important friends. Among many important friends was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Stephen Ward

 introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, embarked on a brief affair with Christine Keeler, most of Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson assignations taking place in Stephen Ward

's home in Wimpole Mews.

Stephen Ward

's friendship with the Russian military attaché Yevgeny Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov's defection. The matter became complicated when, through Stephen Ward

, Ivanov met Christine Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended the relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Christine Keeler's private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons, but a few weeks later admitted Profumo affair. Profumo resigned Profumo ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership of the Privy Council. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Stephen Ward

. In June 1963 Profumo was charged with immorality offences and committed to trial.

In the trial that followed, in July 1963, Stephen Ward

 was abandoned by Profumo society friends and exposed to the contempt and hostility of prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, him was convicted on two counts of living off immoral earnings. However, before the verdict was announced, Stephen Ward

 took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014 the verdict was put under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Born in Lemsford, Hertfordshire, Stephen Ward

 was the second son of Arthur Evelyn Ward, Vicar of Lemsford, and Eileen Esmée, daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors. The Ward family had a military and clerical background; The Ward family were of distinguished Anglo-Irish stock. The explorer Wilfred Thesiger was a cousin- The explorer Wilfred Thesiger father, Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger, son of Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, married Eileen's elder sister, Kathleen. Stephen's siblings were John (b. 1911), Raymond (b. 1916), and twins Bridget and Eileen (b. 1925). In 1920, The Ward family moved to Twickenham, where Stephen Ward

 served as vicar of Holy Trinity Church, then in 1922 to Torquay in Devon, when Stephen Ward

 became Vicar of St. Matthias. Stephen Ward

 later became a Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and, in 1934, a Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral.

Stephen Ward

 was educated at the Slade School, in the village of Canford Magna (near the market town of Wimborne Minster) in Dorset, as a boarder, where Stephen Ward

 was punished for an assault on a fellow-pupil after refusing to name the real culprit. This experience left a longstanding mark. Somewhat lazy and a regular underachiever, Stephen Ward

 had few realistic career choices when Stephen Ward

 left Canford in 1929. In Stephen Ward

 early twenties, Stephen Ward

 studied at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery, now known as the A.T. Still University of Health Sciences (ATSU) in Missouri, in the United States.

Stephen Ward

 moved to London, where Stephen Ward

 worked for a few months as a carpet salesman in Houndsditch before an uncle found an uncle a job in Hamburg as a translator in the German branch of Shell Oil. After a year, Stephen Ward

 left the Hamburg job for Paris and registered for a course at the Sorbonne, while eking out a living as a tour guide. Stephen Ward

 returned briefly to Torquay in 1932 before moving again to London where Stephen Ward

 worked as a tea salesman. 

In 1934, Stephen Ward

 was persuaded by Stephen Ward

 mother to seek qualification as an osteopath, by studying at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery in Missouri, USA. Stephen Ward

 spent four years there, completing a demanding course that qualified Stephen Ward

 as a general medical practitioner in the United States. Stephen Ward

 was greatly impressed by the United States. Stephen Ward

 later commented: "I loved the United States and Americans, a warm-hearted, open and dynamic people. America and Americans, a warm-hearted, open and dynamic people kindness and hospitality made me feel ashamed of the standoffish way the British treat people."

On Stephen Ward

 return from the United States, Stephen Ward

 set up as an osteopath in Torquay. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, Stephen Ward

 volunteered for service in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) but was rejected because Stephen Ward

 American qualifications were not recognised. In 1941, Stephen Ward

 was conscripted as a private into the Royal Armoured Corps, based at Bovington. Stephen Ward

 osteopathic skills became known; and, for much of Stephen Ward

 time at Bovington, Stephen Ward

 was relieved from general duties and permitted to practise Stephen Ward

 profession. This arrangement offended the RAMC; and, after an inquiry, Stephen Ward

's activities were stopped. However, in view of Stephen Ward

 evident talents, Stephen Ward

 was recommended for a commission in the RAMC within the new category of "stretcher-bearer". On 19 June 1943, Stephen Ward

 was commissioned a second lieutenant in the non-medical section of the RAMC. 

In March 1944, Stephen Ward

 was posted to India. The army still found it difficult to accommodate Stephen Ward

; and Stephen Ward

 spent much time canvassing for the proper recognition of osteopathy, while being officially assigned to non-medical duties. However, Stephen Ward

 found opportunities to practise Stephen Ward

 skills; among those whom Stephen Ward

 treated was Mahatma Gandhi, who impressed Stephen Ward

: "Although much of Stephen Ward

 policy was opposed to that of my own country. I knew that when I was with Stephen Ward

 I was in the presence of greatness, and my encounter with Stephen Ward

 was certainly the most important meeting of my life". Following a nervous collapse that led to a period in a psychiatric hospital, Stephen Ward

 returned to England in October 1945 and was discharged from The army "on grounds of disability".

After the Second World War, Stephen Ward

 worked for the Osteopathic Association Clinic in Dorset Square, London. While there he had opportunities to treat well-known public figures, the first of whom was the American ambassador, W. Averell Harriman. Later W. Averell Harriman treated Duncan Sandys, the son-in-law of Winston Churchill; Sandys recommended Stephen Ward

 to Winston Churchill. Stephen Ward

 now had sufficient status and recommendations to set up Stephen Ward

 own private practice, in Cavendish Square just off Harley Street. Stephen Ward

 soon attracted a clientele from the worlds of politics, society and show business, and Stephen Ward

 social life became absorbed into this milieu; Stephen Ward

's polished manners and conversational skills assured Stephen Ward

 of social success. Stephen Ward

 befriended the cartoonist and socialite Arthur Ferrier, whose parties Stephen Ward

 attended regularly and where Stephen Ward

 mixed with, among others, Prince Philip of Greece, later the Duke of Edinburgh but then a junior officer in the Royal Navy. Stephen Ward

 own parties were noted for His own parties social mix: "a barrister, a barrow-boy, a writer, a motor salesman, a peer, and always, for some reason, a steady stream of pretty girls".

Stephen Ward

 enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but Stephen Ward

 libido was low and Stephen Ward

 relationships were often platonic. Stephen Ward

 preference was for the type Stephen Ward

 called "alley-cats" – city girls that Stephen Ward

 could impress and dominate. Stephen Ward

 generally enjoyed discussing and watching sexual activity rather than participating, a factor which may have contributed to the failure of Stephen Ward

 marriage, on 27 July 1949, to an actress, Patricia Mary Baines, who came from a prosperous middle-class background.

Throughout the 1950s Stephen Ward

's practice grew. Among Stephen Ward

 new patients was Lord Astor who became a close friend and who helped Stephen Ward

 to cement Stephen Ward

 place in London society. In return, Stephen Ward

 introduced the shy Lord Astor to Stephen Ward

 own world of night-clubs, parties and girls. In 1956, for a nominal rent, the shy Astor gave Stephen Ward

 the use of a riverside cottage in Stephen Ward

 grounds of the Astor family estate at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire. Many of Stephen Ward

's assorted friends from all walks of life joined Stephen Ward

 for weekends at the cottage, where from time to time they would be joined by the shy Astor and Stephen Ward

 guests from the main house. Sometimes Stephen Ward

 and Stephen Ward

 party would mingle with the gatherings at the main house.

In Stephen Ward

 spare time Stephen Ward

 had attended art classes at the Slade school, and subsequently Stephen Ward

 developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 Stephen Ward

 was commissioned by "The Illustrated London News" to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. a series of portraits of national and international figures included members of the Royal family, among a series of portraits of national and international figures Prince Philip and Princess Margaret. Stephen Ward

 hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Soviet leaders; to help Stephen Ward

, one of Stephen Ward

 patients, the "Daily Telegraph" editor Sir Colin Coote, arranged an introduction to Yevgeny Ivanov, listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy. British Intelligence (MI5) knew from the Soviet double-agent Oleg Penkovsky that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Russian GRU. Stephen Ward

 and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Stephen Ward

 at Wimpole Mews, and sometimes joined Stephen Ward

's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.

British Intelligence (MI5) considered Ivanov a possible defector, and sought Stephen Ward

's help to this end, allocating Ivanov to a case officer known as "Woods". Stephen Ward

 was later used by the British Foreign Office as a backchannel, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union, and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

In 1959 Stephen Ward

 met Christine Keeler, a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho. Captivated by his charm, Christine Keeler, a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho agreed to move in with his, although their relationship was not sexual. Christine Keeler, a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho stayed with his, on and off, for the next several years, and often spent time at the Cliveden cottage. During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests at the cottage with Stephen Ward

. At the main house, among a large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts, was John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and his wife, the actress Valerie Hobson. 

On the Saturday evening, Stephen Ward

's and the shy Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Stephen Ward

 and Stephen Ward

 guests had permission to use. Stephen Ward

 introduced Keeler to Profumo, who was greatly attracted to Stephen Ward

, and promised to be in touch. Stephen Ward

 later reported to British Intelligence (MI5) that Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her had met, and that Profumo had shown considerable interest in Keeler. This information was an unwelcome complication in British Intelligence (MI5)'s plans to use Stephen Ward

 in a honeytrap operation against Ivanov, that might secure Ivanov defection.

Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her Profumo embarked on a brief affair; some suggest that Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her ended after a few weeks, while others believe that Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her usually met at Stephen Ward

's house in Wimpole Mews; Profumo did not pay Keeler for Keeler services, apart from a few small presents and once, a sum of £20 as a gift for Keeler mother. On 9 August 1961 Profumo was warned by Sir Norman Brook, the Cabinet Secretary, of the dangers of mixing with Stephen Ward

's group, since British Intelligence (MI5) were at this stage unsure of Stephen Ward

's dependability. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning "Darling...", cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that a letter ended the association; Keeler insists that a brief affair ended later, after Keeler persistent refusals to stop living with Stephen Ward

.

Press and public remained largely ignorant of the Keeler-Profumo liaison until early in 1963, when Keeler became a focus of newspaper attention as the "missing witness" in a case involving one of Keeler former lovers, Johnny Edgecombe. At that point Keeler began talking indiscriminately, and attempted to sell Keeler story to newspapers. None at this stage dared print it, but rumours of a brief affair were widespread, and there was much speculation. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine "Private Eye" printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: "Mr James Montesi", "Miss Gaye Funloving", "Dr Spook" and "Vladimir Bolokhov". 

In a statement to the House of Commons on 22 March 1963, Profumo denied any impropriety with Keeler. Ward, who knew the truth, at ProfumoProfumo; however, when Profumo found Profumo the target of an aggressive police investigation, and facing immorality charges, Profumo revealed Profumo knowledge to Profumo's political masters and to the press. Profumo found the burden of sustaining Profumo lie too much, confessed Profumo guilt and resigned from government and parliament. Two days after the resignation, amid growing rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, Stephen Ward

 was arrested and charged with several counts of living off immoral earnings and of procuring.

Stephen Ward

's committal proceedings began on 28 June, at Marylebone magistrates' court, where the Crown's evidence was fully reported in the press. Stephen Ward

 was committed for trial at the Old Bailey, but was released on bail pending trial. In Stephen Ward

 account of the trial, which began on 22 July, Richard Davenport-Hines describes it as an act of political revenge: "The exorcism of scandal in high places required the façade of [Ward's] conviction on vice charges". While living with Stephen Ward

, Keeler and her fellow-model Mandy Rice-Davies had made small contributions to household expenses, and had repaid money lent to Keeler and her fellow-model Mandy Rice-Davies by Stephen Ward

. The thrust of the prosecution's case, in which Keeler and Rice-Davies were Keeler and Rice-Davies principal witnesses, was that these payments indicated that Stephen Ward

 was living off these payments immoral earnings. Stephen Ward

's approximate income at the time, from Stephen Ward

 practice and from Stephen Ward

 portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time.

the prosecution's case looked weak; however, Stephen Ward

's perceived image had been heavily tarnished in the committal proceeding. None of his well-known friends offered to speak on his behalf, and MI5 did not reveal the uses None of his well-known friends had made of Stephen Ward

 as a channel of communication to the Russians. The prosecuting counsel, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, portrayed Stephen Ward

 as representing "the very depths of lechery and depravity", while the judge, Sir Archie Marshall, adopted a similarly hostile attitude. 

Stephen Ward

 was represented by James Burge.

Towards the end of the trial, information relating to another case, in which Keeler had been a leading witness, was revealed by the Court of Appeal. This indicated that Keeler's evidence in the prosecution's case had been false. Marshall did not reveal the salient fact to the Stephen Ward

 trial jury that the reliability of the prosecution's chief witness had been compromised, and effectively invited the Ward trial jury to disregard the Court of Appeal's decision. On 30 July Marshall began Marshall summing-up, in a speech that was so damning that Stephen Ward

 despaired. That evening, after writing numerous letters to friends and to the authorities, Stephen Ward

 took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day Marshall completed Marshall summing-up; the Ward trial jury found Stephen Ward

 guilty "in absentia" on the charges of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and Rice-Davies, while acquitting Marshall of several other counts. Sentence was postponed until Stephen Ward

 was fit to appear, but on 3 August Marshall died without regaining consciousness.

On 9 August, a coroner's jury ruled Stephen Ward

's death a suicide by barbiturate poisoning. According to reports, Stephen Ward

 left several notes, one of which read, "I'm sorry to disappoint the vulture [...] I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face The ritual sacrifice." On the day of the inquest, after a private memorial service at the chapel in St Stephen's Hospital, Stephen Ward

's remains were cremated at Mortlake Crematorium. In their accounts of the security aspects of the Profumo affair, Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril provide extra information concerning Stephen Ward

's last hours, Profumo movements and Profumo visitors. Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril also quote from an interview with "a former MI6 operative", who asserted that Stephen Ward

 had been murdered by an agent working on behalf of MI6. The main motive for the killing was Stephen Ward

's continuing ability to embarrass the government and the Royal family. The method, apparently, was to encourage Stephen Ward

 to continue to take barbiturates until a fatal dose had been ingested. The reporter Tom Mangold, one of the last to see Stephen Ward

 alive, dismisses the murder theory, while allowing that there are unexplained circumstances relating to Stephen Ward

's death.

The government appointed Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, to investigate the various rumours that had emanated from and around the Profumo affair. Denning's report, published on 26 September 1963, concluded that there had been no security leaks, and no evidence to link members of The government with associated scandals. Profumo laid most of the blame for the affair on Stephen Ward

, an "utterly immoral" man whose diplomatic activities were "misconceived and misdirected". the Profumo affair had damaged Harold Macmillan's government; Harold Macmillan's resigned as prime minister in October 1963, citing health reasons. Profumo successor was Lord Home, who renounced His successor peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election The government was narrowly defeated by the Labour Party, and Harold Wilson became prime minister.

Stephen Ward

's role on behalf of British Intelligence (MI5) was confirmed in 1982, when the "Sunday Times" located his former contact, "Woods". Keeler, in one of several accounts of Keeler life, has denounced Stephen Ward

 as a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside Philby, Burgess and Maclean, but without direct supporting evidence. Many commentators share Davenport-Hines's view that Stephen Ward

 was a scapegoat and that Stephen Ward

 trial was an "historical injustice". The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the prosecution's case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of his trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson summing up. Above all, the trial judge failed to disclose Keeler's perjury at an earlier trial, which made Keeler a tainted witness. In January 2014 the prosecution's case came under consideration by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, but in 2017 the Criminal Cases Review Commission decided not to refer the prosecution's case to the Court of Appeal, one factor being the unavailability of a full transcript of his trial. 

In the 1989 film version of the Profumo affair, "Scandal", Stephen Ward

 is played by John Hurt. Stephen Ward

 was portrayed by Alexander Hanson in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Stephen Ward the Musical", which opened in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013 and closed in 2014. According to Geoffrey Robertson, the script of the musical is "remarkably faithful to the facts".
