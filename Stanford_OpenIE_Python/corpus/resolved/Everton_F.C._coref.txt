On 10 June 2013, Sandro was promoted to the former's B-team, and made Sandro professional debut on 17 August in a 1–2 away loss against CD Mirandés for the Segunda División championship.

Sandro scored Sandro first goal as a professional on 15 September 2013, netting the first of a 2–0 home win against Real Madrid Castilla. Sandro finished the campaign with 31 appearances, netting seven times to help the former's B-team finish third.

On 18 August 2014, Sandro scored the last of a 6–0 triumph over Club León for that year's Joan Gamper Trophy, after assisting fellow youth graduate Munir El Haddadi in the fifth. Sandro was also called up to the main squad for the match against Elche CF, but eventually remained unused in the 3–0 La Liga win on 24 August.
