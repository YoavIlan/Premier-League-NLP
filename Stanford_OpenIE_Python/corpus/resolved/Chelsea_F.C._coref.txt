In addition to his dribbling his scored three goals and provided two assists in total.

Hazard primarily plays as either an attacking midfielder or a winger and has been credited as being "possibly the outstanding talent in Europe right now". At Lille under former manager Rudi Garcia, Hazard often played in the latter role in the team's 4–3–3 formation and regularly switched flanks because his could use both feet. Following the departures of fellow play-makers Yohan Cabaye and Gervinho in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, former manager Rudi Garcia played Hazard in a creative role as a central attacking midfielder, while also allowing the player to roam back onto the wing if necessary. Two of Hazard's most common exemplary traits are former manager Rudi Garcia pace and technical ability, which have been described as "astonishing" and "mesmerizing". former manager Rudi Garcia speed and dribbling skills, combined with former manager Rudi Garcia creativity, as well as former manager Rudi Garcia flair, balance, agility, and low centre of gravity, courtesy of former manager Rudi Garcia diminutive stature (1.73 m/5 feet 8 inches), allow former manager Rudi Garcia to retain possession, take on defenders, and beat opponents in one on one situations.

At Chelsea, Hazard matured into a world class player and was primarily utilised as a left midfielder, a position which enables former manager Rudi Garcia to cut into the centre and strike on goal with former manager Rudi Garcia stronger right foot. former manager Rudi Garcia development into one of the world's best players was highlighted in the 2014–15 Season; during this season former manager Rudi Garcia won multiple awards and received praise from pundits and manager alike. Manager Jose Mourinho praised Hazard, saying that "former manager Rudi Garcia is already a top player and former manager Rudi Garcia evolution has been fantastic. former manager Rudi Garcia is still very young and former manager Rudi Garcia can become the best player in the world." Hazard's former teammate and Lille captain Rio Mavuba described Hazard as "a great player, with an immense talent. former manager Rudi Garcia's actually not that big, but former manager Rudi Garcia's so fast. former manager Rudi Garcia's also very difficult to dispossess and former manager Rudi Garcia finishing is top notch". Hazard's frequent goal celebration saw former manager Rudi Garcia sliding on former manager Rudi Garcia knees; since 2018 former manager Rudi Garcia has stayed on former manager Rudi Garcia feet. Although Hazard's favoured role is as a left winger, former manager Rudi Garcia is a versatile attacker, and has also been deployed as a second striker, as a lone striker, or even as a false-9 on occasion throughout former manager Rudi Garcia career. Beyond former manager Rudi Garcia speed, creativity, technical skills, and offensive qualities, former manager Rudi Garcia is also an accurate penalty and free kick taker.

Hazard's pace, coupled with former manager Rudi Garcia finishing and ability to retain possession, led to former manager Rudi Garcia former coach Claude Puel dubbing former manager Rudi Garcia "little Messi", in reference to the Barcelona player. Puel's sentiments were later echoed by former Marseille manager and media personality Rolland Courbis who commented "At times it looks to me like Lionel Messi on the right-hand side". Hazard's "flair and tricky" style of play has been described as being similar to Real Madrid player Cristiano Ronaldo; a comparison later repeated by former French international Christophe Dugarry. former French international Christophe Dugarry vision, described as being the trait former French international Christophe Dugarry has improved on the most, has also allowed former French international Christophe Dugarry to develop into an effective passer, which, combined with former French international Christophe Dugarry finishing ability, enables former French international Christophe Dugarry to both score and create goals.

In Belgium, Hazard's talent and similar ascension up the country's football hierarchy has led to comparisons to former Belgian international Enzo Scifo. Both players share the same birthplace and Scifo former French international Christophe Dugarry spent time with Hazard while former French international Christophe Dugarry was in Tubize admitting "Eden, you know, I've coached in Tubize. During the week, I took care of the young people at least once, and former French international Christophe Dugarry, in those days, I immediately saw former French international Christophe Dugarry had a secure future".

However, despite the positive opinions, Hazard has endured criticism from some. In 2010, former Belgium national team manager Georges Leekens questioned Hazard's work-rate. Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme countered both managers' criticism by arguing that Hazard simply possesses an intellectual honesty that is out of the ordinary and unexpected of today's footballer declaring "Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme is a real competitor, not a cheat, nor a moaner, because you don't hear Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme complaining when Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme gets fouled".

Hazard is married to Natacha Van Honacker. On 19 December 2010, it was reported that she had given birth to a baby boy, Yannis. she gave birth to she had given birth to a baby boy, Yannis second son, Leo, in February 2013, and a third son, Samy, in September 2015.

In 2012, Hazard signed a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. He appeared in an advert for the Nike Green Speed II alongside Mario Götze, Theo Walcott, Raheem Sterling, Christian Eriksen and Stephan El Shaarawy in November 2012. Hazard features on the cover of EA Sports' "FIFA" video game "FIFA 15" in Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands and France, along with Lionel Messi. Hazard, Marco Reus, James Rodríguez and Anthony Martial were announced as the official ambassadors of the game and were the finalists to be the new face of the "FIFA 17" game.

Since March 2016, Hazard has been appearing in adverts for Belgium-based Lotus Bakeries promoting their Biscoff biscuit range. The advert shows him successfully taking a free kick, sending a ball into a gap in 10,000 cups.

On 26 June 2017, Hazard became a part-owner of expansion North American Soccer League franchise San Diego 1904 FC to begin play in 2018, alongside Demba Ba, Yohan Cabaye and Moussa Sow.

Eduardo Carvalho

Eduardo dos Reis Carvalho (; born 19 September 1982), known simply as Eduardo, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Dutch club SBV Vitesse on loan from Chelsea, and the Portugal national team.

Eduardo appeared in 134 Primeira Liga games over ten seasons, almost always representing Braga. Eduardo also played professionally in Italy, Turkey, Croatia and England.

After winning the first of Eduardo 36 caps for Portugal in 2009, Eduardo was part of the squads in two World Cups and as many European Championships, starting in the 2010 edition of the former tournament.

Eduardo was born in Mirandela, Bragança District. A product of Braga youth system, Eduardo first appeared in Primeira Liga during 2006–07 when Eduardo served a six-month loan at S.C. Beira-Mar. In the following season Eduardo was also loaned, this time to Vitória de Setúbal, and was as a key player in a Carlos Carvalhal-led side that won the inaugural Portuguese League Cup and thus qualified for the KNVB Cup, with a "Man of the match" display in the final against Sporting Clube de Portugal where Eduardo saved three attempts in the penalty shootout.

Eduardo returned to Braga for the 2008–09 campaign, playing in all the league matches and also in the Minho team's UEFA Cup round-of-16 run. The same happened in the following year – with them finishing in them best-ever position, second – as he only conceded 20 goals, joint-best in the competition.

On 7 July 2010, Eduardo signed a four-year contract with Serie A's Genoa C.F.C. for €4.8 million, replacing departed Marco Amelia. Braga would also receive a 25% future transfer fee if the former sold the player.

Eduardo started all the games but one for the Italians in Eduardo first and only season, in a final midtable position. In July 2011 Eduardo returned to Eduardo country and joined S.L. Benfica on loan, with the Lisbon club having an option to buy at the end of the campaign; during Eduardo spell at the "Estádio da Luz", Eduardo appeared in only nine competitive matches.

On 26 June 2012, Eduardo signed for İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyespor in a temporary deal, joining countryman Carlos Carvalhal (coach) at the Süper Lig team. The following summer Eduardo returned to both Portugal and Braga, while still owned by Genoa.

On 27 June 2014, Eduardo joined several compatriots at Croatian side GNK Dinamo Zagreb after agreeing to a three-year contract. On 25 August 2016, after 95 competitive appearances, Eduardo signed with Premier League club Chelsea on a one-year deal, being brought in to provide experienced cover and competition to Thibaut Courtois and Asmir Begović.

In spite of the Süper Lig team being crowned league champions, Eduardo did not receive a medal as Eduardo did not appear in any games. Eduardo agreed to a one-year contract extension on 23 May 2017, with technical director Michael Emenalo calling technical director Michael Emenalo "a model professional".

Despite being listed on Chelsea's released list following the conclusion of 2017–18, Eduardo signed a new one-year contract in July. Early in the same month, Eduardo agreed to join Dutch team SBV Vitesse on a season-long loan. Eduardo made Eduardo competitive debut on 26 July 2018, in a 2–2 draw away to FC Viitorul Constanța for the Europa League second qualifying round.

After UEFA Euro 2008, Eduardo was called up by new Portugal national team coach Carlos Queiroz for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Denmark, where Eduardo was understudy to Quim. Eduardo made Eduardo full debut on 11 February 2009 in a friendly match with Finland, playing the first 60 minutes in a 1–0 home win, and remained the starter throughout the remainder of the qualifying campaign; Eduardo also started in the final stages in South Africa, keeping clean sheets against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil and only conceding in the round-of-16 loss against eventual champions Spain (0–1), where Eduardo saved many shots from the opposition, mostly by David Villa.

After being relegated to the bench at Eduardo club, Eduardo met the same fate in the national team to Rui Patrício, and both finished the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with five games as Portugal qualified for the finals. Eduardo was also named in the squad of 23 for the KNVB Cupthe KNVB Cup, but only actually played five minutes in the last group stage match against Ghana, coming on for injured Beto.

After strong performances against New York City FC David Villa and Toronto FC's Sebastian Giovinco, Miazga became regarded as one of the best defensive players in CONCACAF Champions League and earned MLS team of the week appearances four times throughout the season. His strong defensive play throughout the 2015 season helped New York win their second Supporters' Shield in three years by having one of the strongest defenses in CONCACAF Champions League. At the end of the season, the Red Bulls offered Miazga a designated player deal which would have made His one of the highest players on the United States national team.

Miazga cited previous commitments to the Poland under-20 team and maintained Miazga had not made a final decision about which nation to represent at senior level. In October 2014, Poland U-20 coach Marcin Dorna stated Poland U-20 coach Marcin Dorna had not given up on Miazga and that the Red Bulls player might still play for Poland U-20 coach Marcin Dorna team. Miazga played for the Poland under-20 team at the 2015 CONCACAF U-20 Championship and helped the United States national team qualify for the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand.

 returned to the scoresheet when Tammy Abraham

There were a lot of offers for club president Vincent Lebrune this summer, but club president Vincent Lebrune didn't want to leave. club president Vincent Lebrune's proving club president Vincent Lebrune on the pitch, and if clubs want club president Vincent Lebrune then clubs are going to have to pay around €50m."

Two months later, their London neighbours Crystal Palace made a €38 million (£31.5 million) bid which would have made English Premier League club West Ham United their record signing, while Italian champions Juventus were also among the interested parties. Although Palace's bid was accepted, Batshuayi did not want to make the move, instead engaging with a €40 million (£33.2 million) offer from English club Chelsea, for which Batshuayi left Belgium's UEFA Euro 2016 squad to undergo a medical.

On 15 February, Batshuayi scored twice against Atalanta in the round of 32 first leg of the UEFA Europa League as Borussia Dortmund won 3–2 and took the lead going into the second leg.

Batshuayi is nicknamed "Batsman", a play on the name of the superhero Batman. Batshuayi younger brother Aaron Leya Iseka plays for Toulouse in the same position, coming through at Anderlecht and signing for Marseille on loan, one month after Batshuayi's exit.
