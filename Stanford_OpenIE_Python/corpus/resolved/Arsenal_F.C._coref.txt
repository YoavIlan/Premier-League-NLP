, in which Bellerín, unchallenged, suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament on Bellerín left knee and was stretchered off of the pitch in the 70th minute at the Emirates Stadium. Bellerín was later ruled out for nine months, consequently missing the remainder of the season and possibly the start of the 2019-2020 season. Arsenal coach Unai Emery perceives Bellerín as "very mature" and believes that "Bellerín is already preparing to come back stronger than before".

Having reached the semi-finals of the 2013 European Championship with the under-19 team, Bellerín made Bellerín debut for Albert Celades's under-21 team on 30 March 2015, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–0 friendly win over Belarus in León.

On 29 May 2016, after being named as a stand-by player for the year's European Championship, Bellerín made Bellerín debut for the full squad by starting in a 3–1 friendly win against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the AFG Arena in St. Gallen, Switzerland. Two days later, Bellerín was chosen for the final squad after Dani Carvajal withdrew through injury. Bellerín was unused as they reached the last 16.

Bellerín is known for Bellerín pace, which allows Bellerín to take on opposition defenders as well as provide defensive cover. At the beginning of the 2014–15 season, Bellerín broke Theo Walcott's 40-metre Arsenal sprint record by 1/100th of a second. Bellerín is considered to be one of the fastest footballers in the world. Like teammates Sead Kolasinac and Nacho Monreal, Bellerín has received more praise for Bellerín attacking abilities, and in the 2018-19 season, Arsenal coach Unai Emery has often employed Bellerín as a wing-back. 

Bellerín became a vegan in 2017, which Bellerín credits for improving Bellerín health.

After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, Koscielny joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing Koscielny as the UEFA Europa League Team's star player in Koscielny desired position, ultimately aiding in the club's promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the UEFA Europa League Team of the Week of the Season. Koscielny continued Koscielny impressive performances following a €1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for Koscielny performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender. Koscielny achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of £8.45 million the following season.

Following Koscielny arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded to be one of the best players in Koscielny position, as well as one of the best in the world. Koscielny had established Koscielny as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club's nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. Koscielny was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another FA Cup and the FA Community Shield twice.

Despite qualifying to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.

Stephan Lichtsteiner

Stephan Lichtsteiner (; born 16 January 1984) is a Swiss professional footballer who plays for club Arsenal and captains the Switzerland national team. An attacking right-back or wing-back, Stephan Lichtsteiner is known for Stephan Lichtsteiner energetic runs down the right wing, as well as Stephan Lichtsteiner stamina and athleticism, which have earned Stephan Lichtsteiner the nicknames "Forrest Gump" and "The Swiss Express".

Stephan Lichtsteiner began Stephan Lichtsteiner professional career with Grasshopper, winning a league title in 2002–03, and moved to Lille in 2005, helping the French club to Champions League qualification in Stephan Lichtsteiner first season with the team. In 2008, Stephan Lichtsteiner joined Italian club Lazio, and won both the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana the following year. In 2011, Stephan Lichtsteiner signed for Juventus for a fee of €10 million. Stephan Lichtsteiner played 257 total games for the Turin side over seven years and won 14 trophies, including the Serie A title in each of Stephan Lichtsteiner seasons with the team. In the summer of 2018, Stephan Lichtsteiner was signed by English club Arsenal.

A full international since 2006, Lichtsteiner has earned over 100 caps for Switzerland, making Stephan Lichtsteiner Lichtsteiner third most capped player of all time. Stephan Lichtsteiner has represented Stephan Lichtsteiner country at two UEFA European Championships and three FIFA World Cups.

Lichtsteiner was born in Adligenswil, Canton of Lucerne and played for the local football club. Stephan Lichtsteiner left home as a teenager to play for Grasshopper Zürich and made Stephan Lichtsteiner first team debut in 2001–02 in the former Nationalliga A (now the Swiss Super League) but only made one league appearance. The following season, Stephan Lichtsteiner began to establish Stephan Lichtsteiner as a first team regular and helped the local football club to the league title. While living in Grasshopper Zürich Stephan Lichtsteiner completed a banking apprenticeship with Credit Suisse but ultimately chose a career in football.

During the 2004–05 season Lichtsteiner sealed a transfer to Lille OSC as one of five Swiss players to enter Ligue 1 during the summer of 2005. Stephan Lichtsteiner became a regular in Stephan Lichtsteiner first season and helped Lille to a third-place finish to secure a Champions League spot. Stephan Lichtsteiner last season ended disappointingly as Lille finished seventh in the Swiss Super League and missed out on European football next season just by a point. However Stephan Lichtsteiner did end with 4 goals, Stephan Lichtsteiner highest tally so far.

After some good performances at UEFA Euro 2008, several clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain and Everton, expressed interest in signing Lichtsteiner. Stephan Lichtsteiner rejected PSG's bid and, in July, signed a four-year contract with Italian side S.S. Lazio for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of €1.5 million as a replacement for fellow Swiss international Valon Behrami, who went to West Ham United. In the April Derby della Capitale against cross-city rivals Roma, he scored he first goal to put Italian side S.S. Lazio up in a heated derby encounter, which ended in a 4–2 win to Italian side S.S. Lazio, and resulted in numerous bookings. Lichtsteiner was also booked for a heated confrontation with Roma defender Christian Panucci, after the Italian had fouled he. During the season, Lichtsteiner formed an attacking tandem down the flanks with Serbian international full-back Aleksandar Kolarov on the other side of the pitch. Although Italian side S.S. Lazio finished tenth, they ended the season on a high by winning the Coppa Italia, and thus earning a place in the UEFA Europa League the next season. Italian side S.S. Lazio played a part in Italian side S.S. Lazio's successful campaign, scoring in the penalty shoot-out against Sampdoria in the final, and also claimed the Supercoppa Italiana at the beginning of the next season. After Kolarov's departure, Italian side S.S. Lazio future at Italian side S.S. Lazio became increasingly in doubt, as several clubs expressed interest in Italian side S.S. Lazio. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Italian side S.S. Lazio opted not to see out the final year of Italian side S.S. Lazio contract, despite the "Biancocelesti" qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.

On 27 June 2011, Juventus confirmed that Lichtsteiner had undergone a medical in Turin and reached an agreement with Italian side S.S. Lazio to pay €10 million in three installments. a transfer to Lille OSC was confirmed on 1 July 2011. Italian side S.S. Lazio marked Italian side S.S. Lazio debut on 11 September 2011 against Parma by scoring the first goal in the 4–1 home victory, the first league goal to be scored in Juventus new stadium.
Juventus went on to win the "Scudetto" and Juventus played a vital part in their strong defensive record, only missing a handful of matches through injury and suspensions.
Lichtsteiner repeated Lichtsteiner opening matchday feat the following season by converting Lichtsteiner left-sided counterpart Kwadwo Asamoah's pass in the 2–0 win. Lichtsteiner played fewer matches during 2013–14 season due to injuries but contributed three goals in all competitions and won Lichtsteiner third consecutive Serie A title. Lichtsteiner crossing and ball-playing ability from the right flank, as well as Lichtsteiner ability to make attacking runs to get on the end of Andrea Pirlo's long passes, came to the fore as a right-sided wing-back in Conte's 3–5–2 formation. As a result, Lichtsteiner finished the season as Juventus's top assist-maker in the UEFA Europa League, alongside Paul Pogba, with eight.

On 6 June 2015, Lichtsteiner started for Juventus in the 2015 the UEFA Europa League Final as the team were defeated 3–1 by Barcelona at Berlin's Olympiastadion; Lichtsteiner was involved in Álvaro Morata's temporary equalising goal. On 23 September 2015, Lichtsteiner was substituted at half time during a league match against Frosinone due to breathing difficulty. It was later necessary for heart surgery to be performed to correct cardiac arrhythmia, which caused Lichtsteiner to be out for a month. On 3 November 2015, Lichtsteiner returned from injury, starting against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the UEFA Europa League and scoring the equalizing goal in the 44th minute of a 1–1 away draw; Álvaro Morata's temporary equalising goal was later voted one of the best goals of the tournament that season.

At the beginning of the 2016–17 season, Lichtsteiner was excluded from Juventus's squad for the UEFA Champions League group stage; this was due to the fact that the club had signed rightback Dani Alves, and had already filled their squad quota, as Juventus were also required to have four club youth products in the 25-men squad, even though initially the only former youth product in the first team was Claudio Marchisio. Thus, Lichtsteiner was excluded to make way for other players. Juventus had also re-signed Juan Cuadrado on loan, which meant that Lichsteiner would face competition for the starting right fullback/wingback/winger position, leading to rumours that Juventus would be leaving the club; nevertheless, Juventus later stated that Juventus would be remaining with Juventus. Despite competition for a starting spot, Lichtsteiner took part in the Supercoppa Italiana on 23 December 2016, as one of the starting eleven, as Juventus lost to Milan on penalties. On 2 February 2017, Lichsteiner renewed Lichsteiner contract until 30 June 2018.

On 7 March 2018, Lichtsteiner made Lichtsteiner 250th appearance for Juventus in a 2–1 win over Tottenham at Wembley Stadium, in the second leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, coming off the bench in the second half to help create Gonzalo Higuaín's goal. Gonzalo Higuaín's made Gonzalo Higuaín's 200th Serie A appearance with the club in a 3–1 home win over Bologna on 5 May, after which Gonzalo Higuaín's announced that Gonzalo Higuaín's would be leaving the club at the end of the season.

On 5 June 2018, Lichtsteiner signed for English club Arsenal on a free transfer. Lichtsteiner made Lichtsteiner Arsenal debut on 12 August, coming on as a substitute in the 35th minute for the injured Ainsley Maitland-Niles in an eventual 2–0 home defeat to Manchester City. On 31 October 2018, Lichtsteiner scored Lichtsteiner first goal for English club Arsenal in the first half of a 2–1 home win over Blackpool in the 2018–19 EFL Cup.

A former youth international, Lichtsteiner played in the 1999 U16 and the 2004 U21 European Championships. He was first called up to the senior squad on two occasions in 2005 but was an unused substitute both times. On 11 November 2006, He made He senior debut in a friendly against Brazil which ended in a 2–1 loss.

Although He missed out on the 2006 World Cup, Lichtsteiner was given a chance to prove He as first choice right back Philipp Degen was out with long-term injury. In May, Köbi Kuhn named Philipp Degen in the squad for the Euro 2008. Köbi Kuhn played every match at the tournament and eventually replaced Philipp Degen as first choice right back. Switzerland ended the tournament with two losses and a win. Köbi Kuhn retained Köbi Kuhn starting place under new manager Ottmar Hitzfeld and played every minute in 8 of the 10 2010 World Cup qualifiers.

Lichtsteiner played seven games in UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, with the Swiss failing to reach the finals in Poland and Ukraine.

In 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, Lichtsteiner played eight full matches in a successful campaign, scoring two first-half goals on 6 September 2013 in a 4–4 draw with Iceland at the Stade de Suisse. Manager Vladimir Petković named Manager Vladimir Petković in the 23-man squad for the finals in Brazil, where Manager Vladimir Petković played every minute in a run to the last 16.

Due to injury to regular captain Gökhan Inler, Lichtsteiner wore the Swiss armband for the first time on 14 October 2014 in Lichtsteiner 70th match, a 4–0 away win over San Marino in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. Prior to the finals in Lichtsteiner was made permanent captain as Inler was dropped due to lack of playing time at club level. the Swiss made the Swiss out of the group stage and faced Poland in the Round of 16. With the score at 1–1, the match was decided by penalties, and Lichtsteiner took first and scored but the Swiss the Swiss lost as Granit Xhaka missed.

Lichtsteiner was fined 5,000 Swiss francs after the 2–1 group win over Serbia for Lichtsteiner part in the controversial goal celebrations of Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka.

A dynamic, hard-working, consistent, and versatile defender, Lichtsteiner is capable of playing anywhere along the right flank, and has been deployed as an attacking full-back or wing-back in a four-man back-line, or also as winger in a 3–5–2 formation. Although he predominantly plays on the right, he has also been used on the left flank on occasion, or even as a makeshift centre-back. A quick, physically strong, tenacious, and tactically intelligent player, he is known for he energetic runs up and down the wing, which enable he to exploit spaces and get on the end of long balls, thus enabling he to help out at both ends of the pitch and cover the right flank effectively. he stamina, dedication and athleticism have earned he the nicknames "Forrest Gump" and "The Swiss Express". Although not particularly skilful from a technical standpoint, he is capable of linking up with teammates and making attacking runs to get on the end of passes, which enable he to get into positions from which he can create chances for strikers with crosses from the touchline, or even score goals himself; while he is mainly regarded for he offensive contribution, he is also known for being reliable defensively. However, at times Lichsteiner has also drawn criticism in the media for lacking composure under pressure, being too rash and aggressive in he challenges, and prone to defensive errors, as well as for being inconsistent in he crossing and distribution from the right wing.

Lichtsteiner is married to Manuela Markworth, an economist and fitness instructor. They have a daughter and a son.

Lichtsteiner acquired the nickname "Forrest Gump" from Lazio-supporting Radio Sei commentator Guido de Angelis after making a run down Lazio-supporting Radio Sei commentator Guido de Angelis flank to score in the 4–2 derby victory over crosstown rivals A.S. Roma. Lazio-supporting Radio Sei commentator Guido de Angelis runs and athleticism has also earned Lazio-supporting Radio Sei commentator Guido de Angelis the nickname "The Swiss Express" since moving to Juventus.

Dominic Thompson

Dominic Thompson

 is a fictional character on the New Zealand soap opera "Shortland Street" who was portrayed by Shane Cortese from 2003 to 2004.

Dominic Thompson

 arrived as the brother of established character Toni Thompson (Laura Hill) however soon after arrival, was revealed as the half brother of Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Initially appearing as a protagonist, Dominic Thompson

 soon developed into a much more sinister character who was key to several high-profile storylines. These included Dominic Thompson

 marriage to Emily Bredican (Sarah Somerville), affair with 16-year-old Delphi Greenlaw (Anna Hutchison), a rivalry with Chris Warner after discovering they were not related, murdering Geoff Greenlaw (Andrew Laing), Geoff Greenlaw (Andrew Laing) controversial return on the shows 3000th episode, Geoff Greenlaw (Andrew Laing) murder of Avril Lucich (Kate Louise-Elliott) and a dramatic conclusion episode in December 2004 that saw Dom die after trying to murder Chris.

Dom's two-year-long stint saw the show receive huge ratings and the period be remembered as a well done and iconic season. The character remains mentioned and referred to as a menacing and monumental character who brought the show back the show excitement.

After auditioning for Geoff Greenlaw and losing out to Andrew Laing, Shane Cortese learned producers had created a character specifically for Shane Cortese to be the brother of a major character and it was undecided whether The character would be "good or bad". Shane Cortese made Shane Cortese debut as Dominic Thompson

 in early 2003 under a yearlong contract with the potential of another 12 month expansion. The character stayed on screen for a year and departed in early 2004. Producers offered Shane Cortese the chance to return on the show's 3000th episode under a contract that would see Shane Cortese continue with the show until mid-2005. Shane Cortese accepted and returned to the show on the momentous 3000th episode. The character ended up getting killed off later in the year.

Dominic Thompson

 arrived to visit Dominic Thompson

 sister Toni (Laura Hill) and quickly got a job at the hospital. Dominic Thompson

 mysteriously got on well with rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) mother - Margot Warner (Dinah Priestley) and when mother - Margot Warner (Dinah Priestley) died, Dominic Thompson

 revealed Dominic Thompson

 as rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) illegitimate half brother. Taking up mother - Margot Warner (Dinah Priestley), Dominic Thompson

 married Emily (Sarah Somerville) and fought attractions to teenager - Delphi Greenlaw (Anna Hutchison). Following a blood test, Dominic Thompson

 realized Dominic Thompson

 was not related to rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) but kept a blood test a secret whilst Dominic Thompson

 started an affair with Delphi. To hide an affair with Delphi, Dominic Thompson

 drugged Dominic Thompson

 wife and soon became a suspect in the murder of Geoff (Andrew Laing) who had discovered an affair with Delphi. Once rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) discovered the truth, Dominic Thompson

 circulated rumours Dominic Thompson

 was a child molestor. Dominic Thompson

 and Delphi planned to run away but Delphi discovered Dominic Thompson

 had killed Geoff and a desperate Dom fled Ferndale.

Dominic Thompson

 returned later in 2004, having started a relationship with Lucy (Sally Stockwell). Dominic Thompson

 managed to successfully avoid capture in relation to Geoff's murder and when Avril (Kate Louise-Elliot) began snooping, Dominic Thompson

 drowned Avril (Kate Louise-Elliot) in Dominic Thompson

 bath tub. When the staff started to turn against Dominic Thompson

 after Avril's sister Bernadette (Kate Louise-Elliot) accused Dominic Thompson

 of murder, Dominic Thompson

 faked mental illness and after escaping a psych ward, Dominic Thompson

 lured rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) to a barn and tried to set rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) on fire. Unsuccessful, Dominic Thompson

 ended up getting caught in a large explosion. With intense burns, Dominic Thompson

 finally admitted to killing Geoff and Avril before Dominic Thompson

 died in Toni's arms.

In 2003 Dominic Thompson

 underwent a storyline where Dominic Thompson

 fell for his sister Toni (Laura Hill). Shane Cortese was at first uncomfortable with a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw, stating; "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." Shane Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dominic Thompson

 was truly in love with Delphi; "Dominic Thompson

 sees Delphi as Shane Cortese soul mate, Shane Cortese affects Shane Cortese in a way no one has before because Shane Cortese's always been suspicious of relationships. Shane Cortese doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for Shane Cortese to like Shane Cortese." Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, Shane Cortese’s an absolute bastard but we know Shane Cortese does love Delphi." The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dominic Thompson

 comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dominic Thompson

 flees when Delphi confronts Dominic Thompson

 about the murder but later returns, with Shane Cortese suggesting it was for love; "But the thing about Dominic is Dominic believes Dominic's doing everything for the right reasons. Dominic's done everything Dominic can for Delphi— that's Dominic main reason for coming back." Dominic Thompson

 later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.

Michael Galvin listed the storyline between rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) and Dom as one of the most iconic storylines on the soap. Michael Galvin believed Michael Galvin physical similarity with Shane Cortese made a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw more believable and captivating. Rebecca Barry Hill of "The New Zealand Herald" noted the character of Dominic Thompson

 as a highlight of the show. The storyline that saw Dom have an affair with Delphi was viewed on as scandalous. Michael Galvin return on the 3000th episode was described as "jaw dropping". a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw is remembered as hugely iconic. The characters stint proved to be a ratings success and the episodes which saw Dominic Thompson

 return, be kidnapped by Bernadette and Bernadette death, proved to be the shows highest rating episodes for the year. Shane Cortese himself however, believed Bernadette was "awful" in the role of Dominic Thompson

 but enjoyed it nonetheless. In 2012, The character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. the storyline between Chris and Dom has been voted by fans as one of the most iconic moments on the show.
