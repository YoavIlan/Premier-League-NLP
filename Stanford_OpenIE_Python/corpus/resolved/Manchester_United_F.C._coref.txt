David de Gea

David de Gea Quintana (; born 7 November 1990) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Manchester United and the Spain national team.

Born in Madrid, De Gea began De Gea career aged 13 with Atlético Madrid and rose through the academy system at the club before making De Gea senior debut in 2009. After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, De Gea helped the Spain national team win both the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010. De Gea performances attracted the attention of Manchester United, which De Gea joined in June 2011 for £18.9 million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.

Since joining United, De Gea has made over 300 appearances and won a Premier League title, an FA Cup, a League Cup, three Community Shields and the UEFA Europa League. For three consecutive seasons from 2013–14 to 2015–16, De Gea was elected as United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, the first player in the award's history to win on three successive occasions (four in total), as well as being included in four consecutive (five in total) PFA Team of the Year sides from 2015 to 2018. In 2018 De Gea was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI.

De Gea was the captain for the Spain under-21 national team that won the European Championship in 2011 and 2013, and also competed in the 2012 Olympics. De Gea made De Gea debut for the senior team in 2014 and was selected for that year's World Cup. De Gea was tipped by many to become the successor to Iker Casillas as Spain's long-term goalkeeper, and also is regarded to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

Born in Madrid and raised in Illescas, De Gea joined Atlético Madrid at the age of 13 when De Gea then-coach Juan Luis Martín lied to the club that Rayo Vallecano were set to sign his then-coach Juan Luis Martín. A few days later, Diego Díaz Garrido scouted De Gea and signed his then-coach Juan Luis Martín immediately. his then-coach Juan Luis Martín eventually made his then-coach Juan Luis Martín way up through the youth ranks at the club before signing his then-coach Juan Luis Martín first professional contract in 2008, aged 17, contracting his then-coach Juan Luis Martín to Atlético until 2011. his then-coach Juan Luis Martín spent his then-coach Juan Luis Martín second season for Atlético Madrid B in Segunda División B. In the summer of 2009, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was approached by Numancia and English team Queens Park Rangers with regards to a loan move, with Atlético sporting director Jesús García Pitarch pushing for his then-coach Juan Luis Martín to move to Numancia. his then-coach Juan Luis Martín rejected the approach, and was punished by being forced to train by his then-coach Juan Luis Martín. Weeks later, Atlético manager Abel Resino noticed his then-coach Juan Luis Martín training alone and invited his then-coach Juan Luis Martín to train with the first team, where his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was rated as the third-choice goalkeeper. The same summer, Atlético manager Abel Resino rejected an offer from English team Wigan Athletic for a permanent transfer for his then-coach Juan Luis Martín.

With first-choice goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo away on international duty at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was called up to English team Wigan Athletic as cover for Roberto. his then-coach Juan Luis Martín made his then-coach Juan Luis Martín debut for the Atlético first-team at the age of 18 on 30 September 2009, coming on as a substitute after Roberto was injured after 27 minutes of Atlético's UEFA Champions League Group stage match away to Porto; his then-coach Juan Luis Martín conceded two late goals as Atlético lost 2–0. Roberto's injury meant that his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was given his then-coach Juan Luis Martín La Liga debut three days later, at home to Real Zaragoza; his then-coach Juan Luis Martín gave away a penalty kick in the 19th minute, but immediately redeemed his then-coach Juan Luis Martín by saving Marko Babić's attempt in an eventual 2–1 win. his then-coach Juan Luis Martín described starting at the Vicente Calderón Stadium as a "dream since childhood". In January 2010, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was touted as a possible replacement for Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who was set to retire in 2011. Days later, however, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín signed a new contract which would keep his then-coach Juan Luis Martín with Atlético until 2013.

After some costly mistakes by Asenjo, and the arrival of Quique Sánchez Flores as manager, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín finished the 2009–10 season as the starting "number one". his then-coach Juan Luis Martín won two man of the match awards along the way, against Athletic Bilbao and Valencia. Additionally, his then-coach Juan Luis Martín appeared in eight matches in the club's victorious UEFA Europa League campaign, including the 2–1 final win against Fulham. Diego Forlán later said of his then-coach Juan Luis Martín first season, "his then-coach Juan Luis Martín was good enough for the top level at 19 and the players had confidence in his then-coach Juan Luis Martín."

De Gea started 2010–11 in impressive fashion, helping Atlético win the season's UEFA Super Cup. In the 90th minute of the 2–0 win against Internazionale, De Gea saved a Diego Milito penalty kick. In September, De Gea was reported that Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had missed a the season's UEFA Super Cup match with Scunthorpe United to travel to Spain to watch De Gea in action against Valencia. De Gea played down the rumours, saying, "The important thing is that I have a contract here and I'm an Atletico player until 2013."

Following De Gea "faultless" performance in the Madrid Derby on 7 November, De Gea was hailed as the heir apparent to Real Madrid's goalkeeper Iker Casillas for Spain, a sentiment Iker Casillas agreed with, saying, "In Spain we are lucky to have very good goalkeepers and De Gea soon might be fighting my place in the team," while Spain manager Vicente del Bosque described De Gea as "the future of the team". De Gea remained the undisputed starting goalkeeper for the remainder of the season, going on to play in every La Liga match for the team en route to a seventh-place finish.

During De Gea time with Atlético Madrid, De Gea shared a locker with Cléber Santana, who died aboard LaMia Flight 2933 on the way to the first-leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals.

Throughout the 2010–11 season, speculation regarding how Manchester United would replace their retiring goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was widespread, and much attention focused on De Gea as United's key target. After Gary Neville's testimonial against Juventus on 24 May, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson claimed that a deal had been done to bring De Gea to Old Trafford, but this was later denied by the player's representatives and the Atlético management, with De Gea stating that De Gea would not consider De Gea future until after the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Following Spain's victory in the tournament, De Gea was spotted in Manchester undergoing a medical with United on 27 June. The next day, De Gea reported that United were making De Gea a contract offer, and the transfer was confirmed on 29 June for a British record fee for a goalkeeper of approximately £18.9 million.

Growing up, De Gea had admired United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, and was often compared to Van der Sar, furthered by being dubbed "Van der Gea".

De Gea made De Gea first appearance for Manchester United in a 3–1 friendly win over Chicago Fire on 23 July 2011. De Gea made De Gea competitive debut for Manchester United against Manchester City in the Community Shield on 7 August. Despite being caught out in the first-half by a header from Joleon Lescott and a long-range Edin Džeko strike that put City into a 2–0 lead, Manchester United rallied in the second half and won 3–2. De Gea made De Gea league debut for Manchester United against West Bromwich Albion a week later, where De Gea received criticism for failing to save Shane Long's goal during a 2–1 United victory, which Ferguson described as "a learning process". De Gea kept De Gea first clean sheet for Manchester United on De Gea Old Trafford debut in the following fixture, a 3–0 victory against Tottenham Hotspur. In the following match, six days later, De Gea saved a penalty from Arsenal captain Robin van Persie, which would have cancelled out Manchester United's 1–0 lead. De Gea made further saves to deny Van Persie and Andrey Arshavin in Manchester United's 8–2 victory. Teammate Wayne Rooney backed De Gea to succeed at Manchester United and hailed De Gea as a "strong character".

On 18 September, Manchester United beat Chelsea 3–1 at Old Trafford, with De Gea making a string of impressive saves, particularly from Ramires – when the midfielder had an empty net to side-foot home, De Gea quickly got across to smother the ball away. De Gea improvement in form continued in De Gea next appearance, as De Gea made two stunning saves to help De Gea team to a 1–1 draw away at Stoke City, and De Gea overall performance was praised by teammates Patrice Evra and Darren Fletcher. De Gea made De Gea first ever the UEFA Europa League start in a 3–3 draw against Basel on 27 September 2011. On 15 October, De Gea was praised for De Gea efforts at Anfield as Manchester United drew 1–1 against Liverpool, providing important saves in a nerve-free performance, prompting Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish to joke, "I thought the press said De Gea was struggling."

On 23 October 2011, De Gea played as Manchester United suffered their worst home defeat since 1955 with a 6–1 loss against cross-town rivals Manchester City, the first time Manchester United had conceded six goals at home since 1930. De Gea was in goal during the league defeat to Blackburn Rovers and was blamed by most media outlets for failing to deal with an aerial ball that led to the conceding of a late goal by Grant Hanley in a 3–2 defeat. De Gea was nonplussed by the error, saying, "all keepers make mistakes once in a while and none of us like it when us do. I have every intention of spending many years here at Manchester United. I want to become a great Manchester United keeper and I want to earn and deserve the respect I hope to get," and spoke of De Gea intentions of surpassing De Gea predecessor: "Hopefully, I will equal or even surpass the performance and contribution Edwin van der Sar made to the club." After this match, De Gea was dropped and replaced by Manchester United's second-choice goalkeeper, Anders Lindegaard. An injury to Lindegaard saw De Gea return to the starting line-up for a 3–3 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 5 February 2012. De Gea later cited De Gea last-minute save from Juan Mata during this match as the turning point in De Gea season, as De Gea went on to play the club's last 19 matches, keeping eight clean sheets.

After a difficult first season in England, De Gea said, "There have been doubts in the first season but I always had faith in my ability. The pressure at an elite club like Manchester United is huge but Ferguson just told me to do what I did at Atlético manager Abel Resino. You have to be as strong when things go wrong but I don't get nervous. Mistakes are normal; everyone makes Mistakes." Ferguson goalkeeping rival Lindegaard, however, promised to fight for the place Ferguson lost via injury, saying, "I want the number one spot because I am the best. I am sure Ferguson is a bit in front right now because Ferguson did well last season, so I need to take every chance I get to prove Ferguson worthy of the number one spot." De Gea later admitted that De Gea thought about leaving after the first season.

Due to De Gea involvement in the 2012 Olympics, De Gea missed Manchester United pre-season tour, but nevertheless returned to the starting line-up for the opening match of the season against Everton. Despite some "outstanding" saves from De Gea, Manchester United lost 1–0. In the next match, a 3–2 win at home to Fulham, De Gea made some noteworthy saves from Mladen Petrić, Moussa Dembélé and Bryan Ruiz. In attempting to claim a cross from Matthew Briggs, however, a misunderstanding with Nemanja Vidić led to the Serbian defender putting the ball in Nemanja Vidić own net for Fulham's second goal.

De Gea received criticism from former Manchester United captain Gary Neville for a punch that allowed Tottenham to score a stoppage time equaliser in a 1–1 draw at White Hart Lane on 20 January 2013, saying, "You've got to learn the hard way and De Gea's learning in a very unforgiving environment where De Gea's judged continuously at the highest level. There's a theory that De Gea saved Manchester United because De Gea made two or three great saves, but unfortunately that's a waste of time. De Gea played well yesterday, but playing well for 92-and-a-half minutes and then doing that in the 93rd is a problem at a club like that." Ferguson responded by saying De Gea critics were "idiots." On 13 February 2013, De Gea made several saves to help Manchester United to a 1–1 draw against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the first leg of the last 16 of the Champions League, and was praised by manager Sir Alex Ferguson for manager Sir Alex Ferguson "excellent" performance, one which was said to have turned manager Sir Alex Ferguson from "villain to hero" and made manager Sir Alex Ferguson "come of age".

On 23 February, De Gea recorded De Gea second consecutive clean sheet for Manchester United, stopping a Loïc Rémy shot and a Christopher Samba header to help Manchester United to 2–0 victory over Queens Park Rangers. This was followed by a 4–0 win at Old Trafford against Norwich City on 2 March. Another clean sheet came on 16 March in a 1–0 victory against Reading. De Gea was on the receiving end of a controversial aerial challenge by West Ham United striker Andy Carroll that left De Gea "poleaxed", with Ferguson expressing Ferguson disbelief at the lack of a red card.

De Gea form throughout the season was recognised by De Gea peers, culminating in being voted into the PFA Premier League Team of the Year. De Gea ended the season with De Gea first Premier League winner's medal with Manchester United, making 28 appearances and keeping 11 clean sheets, as the PFA Premier League Team of the Year topped the Premier League table by 11 points. This placed De Gea joint-fifth in the race for the Premier League Golden Glove.

De Gea season began with a clean sheet in the 2–0 win over Wigan in the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium. On 5 October 2013, De Gea save to deny Sunderland's Emanuele Giaccherini during a 2–1 away win was described by former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel as one of the best saves ever seen in the Champions League. Manager David Moyes agreed with former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel's assessment, describing De Gea's save to deny Sunderland's Emanuele Giaccherini during a 2–1 away was a "turning point" in a match in which De Gea's save to deny Sunderland's Emanuele Giaccherini during a 2–1 away were losing 1–0 at the time, and said De Gea "is improving all the time".

On 1 December, De Gea made De Gea 100th appearance for Manchester United in a 2–2 draw against Tottenham. De Gea received the backing of teammate Darren Fletcher, when, in the League Cup semi-final second leg against Sunderland on 22 January 2014, De Gea was deemed to be at fault when De Gea let a weak Phil Bardsley shot past De Gea deep into extra time; a Javier Hernández goal soon after left the aggregate score at 3–3, resulting in a penalty shoot-out, where De Gea penalty saves from Steven Fletcher and Adam Johnson were not enough to help Manchester United advance, losing 2–1. On 19 March, whilst playing against Olympiacos in the first knockout stage of the Champions League as Manchester United came from 2–0 down to win 3–2 on aggregate, De Gea made a crucial double-save before half-time which was said to have defied "all known laws of physics and physiology" in a performance described as "magnificent". Teammate Phil Jones claimed that "Teammate Phil Jones's up there with the best goalkeepers in the world". De Gea performances throughout the season saw De Gea named as both the club's Players' Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year.

 De Gea helped Manchester United secure back-to-back victories for the first time under their new manager Louis van Gaal in a home victory against Everton on 5 October 2014. During the match, De Gea made three important saves, including one penalty from Leighton Baines, to help Manchester United secure a 2–1 win in which De Gea was voted by Manchester United fans as man of the match. De Gea became the first goalkeeper to stop a penalty from Baines, who had previously converted all of De Gea 14 Premier League penalties. After several vital stops against Everton, West Brom and Chelsea, De Gea was named Manchester United's Player of the Month for October. On 14 December, De Gea was awarded the man of the match for De Gea "outstanding" performance against Liverpool, making eight saves in a 3–0 victory, a performance rated as the best of the Premier League season. De Gea was hailed by Van Gaal as "unbelievable" for De Gea performances, and was called the "saving grace" for being the one constant in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year throughout the season. Amid rumours of a departure, De Gea said De Gea was "proud" to play for Manchester United, and was prompted by former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and Gary Neville to sign a new contract with the club.

At the end of the season, De Gea was shortlisted for the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the PFA Young Player of the Year, before losing out to Eden Hazard and Harry Kane respectively. On 26 April 2015, De Gea was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year the Year as De Gea goalkeeper and De Gea only Manchester United player. De Gea also won both Fans' Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. De Gea save against Everton was voted as Premier League Save of the Season by "Match of the Day", the second consecutive year De Gea won the award.

On 7 August 2015, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal confirmed that De Gea would not be considered for selection for Manchester United's Premier League opener against Tottenham the following day, due to the uncertainty surrounding De Gea future. On 13 August, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal revealed that De Gea had requested to goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek that Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal be left out of the PFA Premier League Team of the Year. De Gea claimed De Gea never expressed a desire not to play, but trained with the reserves soon after. On 31 August, after a summer of speculation, an agreement for a transfer was reached between Manchester United and Real Madrid worth £29 million, including the part-exchange of fellow goalkeeper Keylor Navas. The deal, however, collapsed due to paperwork not being submitted before the transfer window in Spain closed. After the transfer window in Spain closed, Spanish head coach Vicente del Bosque admitted that it would be difficult for Spanish head coach Vicente del Bosque to select De Gea in Spain's European Championship squad if Manchester United continued not to select Spanish head coach Vicente del Bosque.

On 11 September, De Gea signed a new four-year deal with Manchester United, with an option to extend a new four-year deal with Manchester United for a further year. Twelve days later, in the third round of the League Cup, De Gea captained Manchester United for the first time, wearing the armband for the final nine minutes of the armband win over Ipswich Town. In April 2016, while leading the race for the Premier League Golden Glove with 14 clean sheets, De Gea was the sole Manchester United player named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Yearthe Year. On 23 April, in a 2–1 win over Everton in the the League Cup semi-finals, De Gea saved a penalty from Romelu Lukaku.

In May 2016, De Gea became the first player ever to win Manchester United Player of the Year for a third consecutive season. During the same month, De Gea also won BBC "Match of the Day" Save of the Season for the third consecutive year, for De Gea save against Watford on 21 November 2015. In the last league match of the Season, a 3–1 win over Bournemouth, De Gea was denied the chance to share the Premier League Golden Glove with Arsenal's Petr Čech due to a stoppage-time own goal by Chris Smalling.

Under new Manchester United manager José Mourinho, De Gea made De Gea first appearance of the Season in the FA Community Shield against Premier League winners Leicester City. The match ended in a 2–1 victory for Manchester United.

On 20 April 2017, De Gea was selected as a goalkeeper in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year the Year for the fourth time.

On 17 September 2017, at the fifth match of the Champions League against Everton, De Gea made De Gea fourth clean sheet of the Season and 100th overall for Manchester United.
On 2 December 2017, in a 3–1 win over Arsenal, De Gea recorded 14 saves and equalled the mark that was shared by Tim Krul and Vito Mannone as the Premier League record for the greatest number of saves in a single game and De Gea also won the Man of the Match award.

On 18 April 2018, De Gea was selected as a goalkeeper in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year the Year for the fifth time as the only Manchester United player.

On 11 May 2018, after a 0–0 draw against West Ham, De Gea earned De Gea 18th clean sheet of the Season and also secured the Premier League Golden Glove since De Gea joined Manchester United in 2011.

The 2018–19 season began with De GeaDe Gea . The start of 2019, however, saw De Gea manage the same number in just eight appearances, including a 1–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 13 January 2019, in which De Gea made 11 saves to keep Spurs off the scoresheet, the second most by a goalkeeper in any one Premier League match, behind only De Gea 14 saves against Arsenal a year earlier. De Gea clean sheet against Liverpool on 24 February was De Gea 100th for Manchester United in the Champions League, making De Gea the seventh goalkeeper to reach that milestone for a single club in the competition and the second for Manchester United after former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.

De Gea helped Spain's under-17 team win the 2007 European Championship, and finish second at the 2007 World Cup. In early May 2010, courtesy of solid Atlético performances, De Gea was named by senior squad manager Vicente del Bosque in a provisional 30-man squad for the 2007 World Cupthe 2007 World Cup; however, De Gea did not make the final cut. In 2011, De Gea was part of the Spain under-21 team that won the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.
On 15 May 2012, De Gea was called up for to the Spanish senior team for two matches against Serbia and PR China. De Gea was in consideration for senior squad manager Vicente del Bosque Euro 2012 squad, but did not make the final 23-man group. De Gea was selected, however, to play at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and played all three matches as Serbia was eliminated in the group stage. De Gea and Spain under-21 retained De Gea and Spain under-21 European title in 2013.

On 13 May 2014, De Gea was selected in Spain's 30-man provisional squad for the 2007 World CupWorld Cup, and later made the final squad. De Gea made De Gea first senior international appearance against El Salvador in a 2–0 friendly victory on 8 June in preparation for the tournament, replacing Iker Casillas for the last seven minutes of the match at the FedExField in Washington D.C. As third-choice goalkeeper behind Casillas and Pepe Reina, De Gea was the only member of the final squad not to feature at the 2007 World Cup, in which Spain were eliminated in the group stage. On 4 September 2014, De Gea made De Gea first start for Spain, playing the whole 90 minutes against France in a Paris friendly and conceding a goal from Loïc Rémy to lose 1–0. De Gea played De Gea first competitive international on De Gea third cap on 12 October, keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win away to Luxembourg in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying.

De Gea has been tipped by many to succeed Casillas as the long-term number one goalkeeper, including Casillas. On 31 May 2016, De Gea was named to senior squad manager Vicente del Bosque final 23-man Spanish squad for UEFA Euro 2016. De Gea started their opening match against the Czech Republic in Toulouse, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory. De Gea followed up with another clean sheet against Turkey as Spain won 3–0. The following match, however, De Gea conceded twice to Croatia as De Gea team lost 2–1. Spain was eliminated in the round of 16 on 27 June, with their opponent Italy scoring the only two goals of the match.
On 21 May 2018 De Gea was called up to Spain's squad for the 2018 the 2007 World Cup in Russia. In Spain's first game of the tournament on 15 June, De Gea was at fault for Portugal's second goal, letting a Cristiano Ronaldo shot slip through De Gea grasp; Cristiano Ronaldo completed a hat-trick during the eventual 3–3 draw, with Cristiano Ronaldo first goal coming from a penalty, and Cristiano Ronaldo third from a free-kick, which were Portugal's only other shots on target. In Spain's second group match against Iran on 20 June, Cristiano Ronaldo kept a clean-sheet in a 1–0 victory. De Gea continued to struggle in Spain's final group match against Morocco on 25 June, however, which ended in a 2–2 draw; De Gea unsteady performances in the group stage drew criticism in the media, who noted that De Gea had only made one save in the tournament. On 1 July, De Gea also failed to make a save during Spain's 4–3 penalty shootout loss to hosts Russia in the Round of 16; the match had ended in a 1–1 draw after extra-time, with De Gea being beaten by an Artem Dzyuba penalty in the first half. De Gea ended the tournament having conceded six goals from seven shots on target, excluding the four goals De Gea conceded in the penalty-shootout; with only one save, De Gea recorded fewer saves than any other goalkeeper who had played at least three matches in a single edition of the tournament since 1966.

De Gea criticised the Adidas Telstar 18 official match ball, calling the Adidas Telstar 18 official match ball "really strange" and claiming that "the Adidas Telstar 18 official match ball could have been made a lot better."

Regarded as a highly promising prospect in De Gea youth, De Gea soon developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world, with some in the sport even labelling De Gea as the current best keeper in the world. An elegant and athletic keeper, De Gea is known in particular for De Gea outstanding reflexes, agility, and shot-stopping ability between the posts, as well as De Gea penchant for saving the ball with De Gea feet, which enable De Gea to produce acrobatic dives and spectacular saves. Former goalkeeper Shay Given labelled De Gea as the best shot-stopper in the world in 2018. De Gea has also stood for De Gea consistency, composure, leadership, and De Gea positional sense. Due to De Gea slender frame, De Gea initially struggled at defending high balls as a youngster; often punching balls away rather than holding on to rather. De Gea has since shown great improvements in De Gea aerial prowess, handling, command of De Gea area, decision making, and ability to come out and claim crosses, in particular after De Gea developed physically and gained more experience. Furthermore, De Gea is highly regarded for De Gea speed when rushing off De Gea line in one on one situations, which also enables De Gea to function as a sweeper-keeper. In addition to De Gea goalkeeping abilities, De Gea possesses excellent ball control, vision, and distribution with either foot, which enables De Gea to start attacking plays from the back.

In January 2012, De Gea was confirmed as farsighted, although this is not thought to have affected De Gea performances.
De Gea has stated that De Gea is a fan of heavy metal music, with Avenged Sevenfold being one of De Gea favourite bands. De Gea girlfriend is Spanish singer Edurne.

Romelu Menama Lukaku Bolingoli (; born 13 May 1993) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Manchester United and the Belgium national team. 

Born in Antwerp, Lukaku began Lukaku professional career at Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht in 2009, where Lukaku made Lukaku senior debut, at age 16. In Lukaku first season, Lukaku completed the campaign as the league's top goalscorer, and won the league championship. Following similar individual success in Lukaku second season, highlighted by Lukaku win of the Belgian Ebony Shoe, Lukaku relocated to England to transfer to Premier League club English club Chelsea of the Premier League in 2011, for a fee of £10 million (€12 million).

Lukaku featured sparingly in Lukaku first campaign at Premier League club Chelsea, and instead, Lukaku decided to depart on loan at fellow league club West Bromwich Albion in 2012. Lukaku shone with the Belgium national team, registering 17 league goals, and guided fellow league club West Bromwich Albion to an unlikely eighth-place finish. However, after no further reassurances over playing time, Lukaku again departed on loan, this time to Everton, in 2013. After finishing the season with 15 league goals and helping Everton reach a club-record points tally, Lukaku joined the Belgium national team in a permanent deal worth a club-record fee of £28 million in 2014. 

After three successful individual campaigns on Merseyside, which included an appearance in the 2016–17 PFA Team of the Year, Lukaku signed for Manchester United in 2017, for an initial fee of £75 million. This transfer made him the most expensive Belgian player of all time.

A Belgian international, Lukaku has played 79 games for Lukaku country, and registered 45 goals, making Lukaku Belgium's all-time top goalscorer. Lukaku made Lukaku senior international debut for Belgium in 2010, at age 17, and has since represented his country at three major tournaments, including two FIFA World Cups and one UEFA European Championship. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Turkey, Lukaku led Belgium to a third place finish by finishing as the joint second-highest goalscorer, and won the Bronze Boot.

Lukaku joined Lukaku local team Rupel Boom at age five. After four seasons at Rupel Boom, Lukaku was discovered by scouts of Lierse. Lukaku played for Lierse from 2004 until 2006, scoring 121 goals in 68 matches. After Lierse were relegated from the Belgian Pro League, Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht purchased 13 youth players from Lierse in the 2006 mid-season, including Lukaku. Lukaku played three more years as a youth player with Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht, scoring 131 goals in 93 matches.

When Lukaku turned 16 on 13 May 2009, Lukaku signed a professional contract with Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht lasting until 2012.

Lukaku became a regular member of Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht's first team during the 2009–10 season, scoring Lukaku first goal at senior level against Zulte Waregem in the 89th minute after coming on as substitute for Kanu on 28 August 2009. "After scoring I dived into a sea of happiness," Lukaku told Berend Scholten from UEFA.com. "You think you are flying and can take on the whole world." Lukaku ended the 2010–11 season as the top goalscorer in the Pro League with 15 goals as Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht won Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht 30th Belgian title. Lukaku also scored four goals during the club's run to the last 16 of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. During the 2010–11 season, Lukaku scored 20 goals in all competitions, but Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht failed to retain Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht league title despite finishing top of the table during the regular season.

Fenerbahçe defender Simon Kjær told French newspaper "L'Équipe", "Fenerbahçe defender Simon Kjær's really good for 19. I didn't know Fenerbahçe defender Simon Kjær when I was in France.

Lee Grant

Lee Grant (born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal; October 31, during the mid-1920s) is an American actress and film director.

In her 1951 film debut, her played the role of a young shoplifter in William Wyler's "Detective Story", co-starring Kirk Douglas and Eleanor Parker. It earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, along with the Best Actress Award at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival.

In 1952, as her had refused to testify against her husband at the HUAC hearings, her was blacklisted from most acting jobs for the next ten years. her was then only able to find occasional work on the stage or as a teacher during that period. It also contributed to her divorce. After her was removed from the blacklist in 1962, her rebuilt her acting career in films, after which her starred in 71 TV episodes of "Peyton Place" (1965–1966), followed by lead roles in films such as "Valley of the Dolls" (1967), "In the Heat of the Night" (1967), and "Shampoo" (1975), for which her won her first Oscar. In 1964, her won the Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress for her performance in "The Maids". During her career, her was nominated for the Emmy Award seven times between 1966 and 1993, winning twice.

Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal in Manhattan, the only child of Witia (née Haskell), an actress and teacher, and Abraham W. Rosenthal, a realtor and educator. her father was born in New York City, to Polish-Jewish immigrants, and her mother was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. The family resided at 706 Riverside Drive, in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. her date of birth is October 31, but the Year is disputed, with all years ranging from 1925 to 1931 having been given as her year of birth at some point; however, census data, travel manifests, and testimony suggest that her was born in 1925 or 1926, while Lee Grant stated ages at the time of her professional debut and Oscar nomination indicate her was born in 1927.

her debuted in "L'Oracolo" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1931 and later joined the American Ballet as an adolescent. her attended Art Students League of New York, Juilliard School of Music, The High School of Music & Art, and George Washington High School, all in New York City. Lee Grant graduated from high school, and won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, and studied under Sanford Meisner. Studied at HB Studio under Uta Hagen. Sanford Meisner subsequently enrolled in HB Studio under Uta Hagen in New York.

Lee Grant had Sanford Meisner first stage ballet performance in 1933 at the Metropolitan Opera House. In 1938, in Sanford Meisner early teens, Sanford Meisner was made a member of the American Ballet, under George Balanchine. As an actress, Lee Grant had Sanford Meisner professional stage debut as understudy in "Oklahoma" in 1944. In 1948, Sanford Meisner had Sanford Meisner Broadway acting debut in "Joy to the World". Lee Grant established Sanford Meisner as a dramatic method actress on and off Broadway, earning praise for Sanford Meisner role as a shoplifter in "Detective Story" in 1949.

Sanford Meisner made Sanford Meisner film debut two years later in the film version ("Detective Story"), starring Kirk Douglas, receiving Sanford Meisner first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination, and winning the Emmy Award. Sanford Meisner said Sanford Meisner enjoyed working under director William Wyler, who helped guide Sanford Meisner.

In 1951, Sanford Meisner gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for actor J. Edward Bromberg, whose early death, Sanford Meisner implied, was caused by the stress of being called before House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). After an impassioned eulogy was published, Sanford Meisner was summoned by the same committee to testify against Sanford Meisner husband, playwright Arnold Manoff, but refused. As a result, for the next ten years, Sanford Meisner "prime years", as Sanford Meisner put it, Sanford Meisner was blacklisted and Sanford Meisner work in television and movies was limited.

Kirk Douglas, who acted with Sanford Meisner in "Detective Story", recalled that director Edward Dmytryk, a blacklistee, had first named Sanford Meisner husband at the HUAC:

Lee Grant appeared in a limited number of stage and television shows during these years. In 1953, Lee Grant played Rose Peabody on the CBS soap opera, "Search for Tomorrow". In the Broadway production of "Two for the Seesaw" in 1959, Lee Grant succeeded Anne Bancroft in the lead female role.

By the time Lee Grant name was finally removed from the blacklist in the early 1960s, Lee Grant had since been divorced, remarried, and had a young daughter, Dinah. Lee Grant began re-establishing Lee Grant television and movie career. In Lee Grant autobiography, Lee Grant writes: Lee Grant experience with the blacklist scarred Lee Grant to such an extent that as late as 2002, Lee Grant would freeze and go into a "near trance" when anyone asked Lee Grant about Lee Grant experiences during the McCarthy period.

Lee Grant's first major achievement, after HUAC officially cleared Lee Grant, was in the 1960s television series "Peyton Place", as Stella Chernak, for which Lee Grant won an Emmy in 1966. In 1967, Lee Grant appeared in an episode of "Mission Impossible", portraying the wife of a U.S. diplomat who goes undercover to discredit a rogue diplomat. That same year, Lee Grant played the distraught widow of a murder victim in the Oscar-winning "In the Heat of the Night". In 1963, Lee Grant won acclaim for Lee Grant stage performance in the off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's "The Maids".

Lee Grant received subsequent Academy Award nominations for the dramas "The Landlord" (1970) and "Voyage of the Damned" (1976). Lee Grant acting range extended into comedy equally well, notably in several roles as an overbearing mother. In "Plaza Suite" (1971), a comedy directed by Arthur Hiller and written by Neil Simon, Lee Grant played the harassed mother of a bride, with Walter Matthau as Her father. her film was followed by another comedy role as the mother in "Portnoy's Complaint" (1972).

Also in 1971, Lee Grant played cold-blooded killer Leslie Williams in the second episode ("Ransom for a Dead Man") of the Peter Falk series "Columbo". Lee Grant would appear with Falk again on Broadway "Prisoner of Second Avenue", whose playwright Neil Simon said that whose playwright Neil Simon "first and only choice" for the part was Grant, who Falk said was equally at home with dramatists such as Chekhov or Sidney Kingsley, yet could also be "hilariously funny" when the script called for it, as she was able to portray essential honesty in she acting.

Among she most notable roles was as Warren Beatty's older lover in "Shampoo" (1975), for which she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. her film received mixed reviews, but was Columbia's biggest hit in the studio's 50-year history. "Shampoo" was the second film in which Lee Grant acted under director Hal Ashby. Critic Pauline Kael, comparing Critic Pauline Kael in both films, noted Lee Grant "is such a cool-style comedienne that Critic Pauline Kael's in danger of having people say that Critic Pauline Kael's good, as usual." During the filming, however, Critic Pauline Kael did have some serious disagreements with Beatty, who was also the producer, and nearly quit. During one scene, Critic Pauline Kael wanted to play it in a way Critic Pauline Kael felt was more realistic from a woman's perspective, but Warren Beatty's disagreed. After thinking about one scene for a few days, Critic Pauline Kael told director Ashby that Critic Pauline Kael could not do it Warren Beatty's's way and was quitting. As Critic Pauline Kael was walking out, Warren Beatty's stopped Critic Pauline Kael, and asked what was wrong. "I sat down and told Warren Beatty's", Critic Pauline Kael said. "Warren Beatty's threw up Warren Beatty's hands and said, 'Play his hands your way. What do I know? I'm a man.'"
Despite the success of her film, Lee Grant was feeling less secure in Hollywood, as Lee Grant was then around fifty years old. Lee Grant writes:
In March 1971, Lee Grant appeared in the "Columbo" episode "Ransom for a Dead Man"', and was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie. Having been nominated for two performances in the same acting category, Lee Grant received her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for Lee Grant other Emmy-nominated performance in her film, "The Neon Ceiling". The only other nominee was Colleen Dewhurst; in Lee Grant's acceptance speech, Lee Grant wryly noted, "I must thank Colleen Dewhurst since it takes two of me to equal one of Lee Grant." 

During the 1975-76 television season, Lee Grant starred in the NBC sitcom "Fay", which, to Lee Grant chagrin, was canceled after eight episodes. Lee Grant made a guest appearance on "Empty Nest", in which Lee Grant daughter Dinah Manoff co-starred. In 1978 Lee Grant was the lead actress in the sequel, "".

"WhoScored"'s Martin Laurence stated in 2018 that "Luke Shaw can’t get a kick at Manchester United and that is down to the form of Ashley Young, who has adapted to another new role superbly. Ashley Young is now proving to be an aggressive and intelligent defender, all while still offering a threat going forwards with Ashley Young delivery into the box. On current form the 32-year-old shouldn’t just make the cut, but be considered as England’s first choice." Other than being deployed as a left-back, Ashley Young had also being deployed as a right-back.

Matić's qualities have led to comparison to former Chelsea manager José Mourinho ex-teammate at Manchester United, Michael Carrick.

Matić's younger brother, Uroš, is also a professional footballer, playing for Danish Superliga side F.C. Copenhagen. Matić is of partial Macedonian descent as Matić maternal grandfather is from Volkovija.
