The following month, Van Dijk scored once - Van Dijk first goal in the UEFA Europa League for the club - and assisted another in a 3–1 win over Bayern Munich. In doing so, Van Dijk became the first player since Craig Bellamy in 2007 to score and assist a goal for Liverpool in a knock-out stage match away from home in the competition.

Van Dijk made Van Dijk full international debut for Netherlands on 10 October 2015, in a 2–1 victory away from home against Kazakhstan in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier.

Van Dijk was awarded the captaincy of Kazakhstan by manager Ronald Koeman on 22 March 2018, and Van Dijk first match as captain was a 1–0 home friendly defeat by England the next day.

On 13 October, Van Dijk scored in a 3–0 win over 2014 World Cup champions Germany in the UEFA Europa League.

Van Dijk is a right-footed centre back, who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although Van Dijk can also play as a right-sided centre back.

Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called Van Dijk "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the ideal central defender", praising Van Dijk as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong leadership qualities", while commenting that since Van Dijk move to England, Van Dijk is "more tactically aware now [...] Van Dijk anticipation and timing has improved and Van Dijk is a lot more of an all-rounder". McGuinness believes Van Dijk "biggest problem" is that Van Dijk "can switch off when the game is comfortable".

Van Dijk commonly uses only Van Dijk first name on the kit. According to Van Dijk uncle Steven, this is because of a feud with Van Dijk father.

After initially starting as a left winger at Premier League club Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers, new manager Jürgen Klopp utilised Firmino more centrally, initially as a False 9.

Ryan Babel, a teammate of Firmino's at Hoffenheim, described Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" as "A tricky player. Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" can dribble, shoot, Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" has a great shot, Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" can play a lot of through balls and Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" assists are very good", while also praising a heading ability which would not be common amongst other players of Firmino's stature. Babel also stated that Firmino had a humble mentality and no problems with attitude. In addition to Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" technical skills, creativity, link-up play, and goalscoring, Firmino has also been praised by Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" managers, teammates, and pundits for Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" positional sense, intelligent movement, and ability to make attacking runs off the ball, which often draws opposing players out of position and creates space for Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" teammates.

Due to Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" energy and defensive work-rate off the ball, new manager Jürgen Klopp has referred to Firmino as the "engine" that propels the team's relentless counter-attacking system; "If Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" loses the ball, Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" fights for it back. If Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" loses it again, Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" fights for he loses it again. Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" looks like the engine of the team." The suitability of Firmino's playing style to new manager Jürgen Klopp's pressing system has meant that Firmino was referred to as "Premier League club Liverpool's most important player" on several occasions during the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons.

Firmino is also well-known for Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" popular "no-look" goals. One of Ian Doyle of the "Liverpool Echo" best known goal celebrations, 'the Matador', features in the "FIFA" video game "FIFA 19".

Firmino married Larissa Pereira in Firmino hometown in June 2017. They have two daughters. Firmino has been given the affectionate nickname "Bobby" by Premier League club Liverpool fans and players – a shortening of Firmino first name "Roberto".

In December 2016, Firmino was arrested for drink driving. Firmino was fined £20,000 and had Firmino driving licence revoked for a year when sentenced at Liverpool Magistrates' Court in February 2017.

<doc id="2206759" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206759" Jones is an American singer, songwriter and record producer. Jones style of house and techno music has been compared to and inspired by the likes of Kraftwerk, Prince, Gary Numan, and Nitzer Ebb.

Jones is also known as Cajmere, Geo Vogt, Green Velvet, Half Pint, Curan Stone, and Gino Vittori.

Before becoming a professional musician, Jones studied chemical engineering at the University of Illinois. In 1991, Jones left a Master's program at UC-Berkeley to move back to Chicago, releasing Jones first song ("Coffee Pot" on ClubHouse Records) the same year. Up until this point, music had been a hobby fueled by cobbling together tracks on Jones "sixty-buck keyboard, a cheap four-track and a cheap drum machine" set-up while still an undergraduate at the University of IllinoisIllinois. This DIY method of production was never taken seriously, and when childhood plans to become a doctor were shelved, Jones was firmly committed to a career as a chemical engineer. Jones was an occasional DJ and eventually became a budding musician. As time went on, Jones discovered what was Jones innate love and understanding for house music, a sound that had grown throughout the mid-1980s out of Chicago's deep-rooted house music scene. Jones played the saxophone at school and had a talent for trying to play with a keyboard but remained largely un-interested in what Jones saw as Jones 's passion. It was this cut-up and tacky production style of the early house sound that Jones absorbed and translated into the "Underground Goodies" EP, Jones first release as Cajmere (the CAJ derived from the artist's initials) ) put out in 1991 on Jones own recently started Cajual label. A year later Jones had Jones first massive hit as Cajmere with the house tune "Coffee Pot (It's Time for the Percolator)," which was also released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records. Jones then teamed up with Chicago-based vocalist Dajae for "Brighter Days," which entered #2 on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Music/Club Play, a high-impact and mellower house tune that was released on Cajual and distributed by NYC-based Emotive Records.

Interested in making something totally different from 

 Cajmere moniker and other work, Curtis created Relief as an offshoot to 

 Cajual records in 1993. The first Relief release was also 

 first Green Velvet production, 1993's "Velvet Tracks," which came from a name given to 

 by a girlfriend's father, emerged as the flamboyant, neon-haired electro punk, although in interviews 

 denied being linked to the Punk lifestyle and fashion, as 

 was more inspired by the likes of David Bowie and Sly and the Family Stone, 

 created mid-1990s hits such as "Preacher Man," on which a Moral Majority-type of preacher spoke (the Reverend Trotter, not, contrary to popular belief, Reverend Franklin); "Answering Machine," a darkly funny house track consisting of taped messages from an answering machine, including a bad news message from a girlfriend and a noise complaint message from a girlfriend landlord—all made with Jones's voice; and "Flash," which was a #1 US dance hit in 1995 and was included on many DJ-mixed compilation albums. After DJing under both of his now infamous monikers, his released his first album, "Constant Chaos", with Belgian Music label Music Man in 1999, which showed Green Velvet's style of house progress into styles similar to Prince and Kraftwerk, his spoken-word monologues also took a bizarre turn. In "Abduction" his spoke about little green men turning up while washing dishes.

By the time "Constant Chaos" was released, Jones had temporarily halted activity on Jones labels for almost a year. Still DJing as Cajmere Jones'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work out what to do next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where Jones released Jones second compilation album, the self-titled "Green Velvet", which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time Jones gave Green Velvet's a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, Jones unleashed Jones second album, the dark "Whatever", which was a step away from Jones Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although "Sleepwalking" had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album Jones tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song "When?"), drug use (highlighted on "Genedefekt" and "La La Land"), alienation (highlighted on "Sleepwalking"), and being told what to wear and do by “the system” (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track "Gat"). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of "underground American industrial stuff." He released the single "La La Land" in 2001, originally designed as a wake-up call for clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of He most popular tunes. This was followed by "Genedefekt". He live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing He, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than He did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.

After appearing under a host of different names for He various remixing and side projects, Green Velvet released He third album, "Walk In Love", in 2005. his third album had a more house music-oriented style to his third album, but the odd Prince- and Punk-sounding tracks still remained, as Curtis actually got a live guitarist to play on "Come Back" and the closing track "Pin-Up Girl" had a similarity to New York-based Electroclash group Fischerspooner. After "Walk In LoveLove", Green Velvet produced and remixed releases for fellow Relief Records artists and Green Velvet, and played a host of DJ session live shows in 2006.

After staying quiet in the music scene, Green Velvet revealed in 2006 Green Velvet had become a born-again Christian after a serious overdose of a mixture of Magic Mushrooms, Marijuana and (allegedly) GHB, and promised to turn Green Velvet life around after this incident. Green Velvet latest release, the single "Shake and Pop", is a departure from the recent darker electronica style, as Green Velvet claims Green Velvet has found a brighter future since converting. In 2007, Green Velvet released the online-only track "Love Peace, Not War", a short ditty in response to the United States' war in Iraq.

In 2014, Green Velvet joined forces with Claude VonStroke, another veteran artist who grew up in the Mid-West, to form a side project known as Get Real. With both having a noticeable impact on both the house and techno scenes, many wondered why this duo didn't happen sooner. In reality, the project was by accident. However, the project couldn't have turned out better. Their first release came out as an EP on Claude's label, Dirtybird, with the appearance of “Mind Yo Bizness” and “Snuffaluffagus". Claude has stated, “Nobody is trying to steal the spotlight or take over the project which isn’t always the case in a duo. We each represent We style but We make a new style by working together.”

Ben Woodburn is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool, and for the Wales national team.

Ben Woodburn became Liverpool's third-youngest player in history upon making Ben Woodburn senior debut in November 2016 and the club's youngest-ever goalscorer in Ben Woodburn second appearance. Ben Woodburn is also Wales' second-youngest-ever goalscorer behind Gareth Bale, having netted on Ben Woodburn senior debut at the age of 17 in September 2017.

Born in Nottingham, Ben Woodburn was raised in Tattenhall, Cheshire and played both cricket and football from a young age. He joined Liverpool's academy at under-7 level where He steadily progressed through the youth ranks, leading to former academy director Frank McParland identifying He as one of the brightest prospects at the club. During He schooling, Liverpool agreed to a request from Ben Woodburn's parents that He should stay at home rather than in Rainhill, which was closer to the academy in Kirkby. In order to facilitate his development, the club arranged for a driver to transport a driver every day from training back to a driver home in Tattenhall. When a driver was 15 years old, Ben Woodburn was fast-tracked from Liverpool's under-16s to the under-18s and a driver rapid development saw a driver included in Liverpool's "Futures Group", a programme which afforded the club's most talented young players a weekly opportunity to train with then first-team coach, Pep Lijnders.

Having impressed first-team manager Jürgen Klopp during these training sessions, Ben Woodburn was handed a driver non-competitive debut during the 2016–17 pre-season in a 1–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. a driver came off the bench in Liverpool's next match to score one and assist another for Roberto Firmino in a 5–0 friendly win over Fleetwood Town. Ben Woodburn then, along with Kevin Stewart and fellow academy graduate Trent Alexander-Arnold, signed a driver first professional contract with Liverpool on 8 November 2016.

a driver made a driver senior debut for Liverpool on 26 November, coming on as a 92nd-minute substitute for Georginio Wijnaldum in a 2–0 Premier League victory over Sunderland. Upon doing so, Ben Woodburn became Liverpool's third-youngest debutant of all time at the age of 17 years and 42 days, and the club's second-youngest-ever in the Premier League, behind Jack Robinson. Three days later, he became Liverpool's youngest-ever goalscorer at the age of 17 years and 45 days when he came off the bench to score in an EFL Cup quarter-final win over Leeds United, bettering Michael Owen's record by 98 days. Following he rapid development at Liverpool, both Sky Sports and "The Guardian" named Woodburn as one of the top young players to watch in 2017.

On 8 January 2017, he became the then-youngest player to represent the club in the FA Cup when he started in a 0–0 draw with Plymouth Argyle. he first start in the league followed on 4 April in a 2–1 away triumph over Stoke City which saw he become the third-youngest player to start for Liverpool in the Premier League era behind Michael Owen's and Jordon Ibe. The following week he was nominated for the 2017 European Golden Boy award, but was beaten by French forward, Kylian Mbappé. On 9 May, Ben Woodburn won Liverpool's Academy Player of the 2017 European Golden Boy award following a campaign which saw he score eight goals in Premier League 2 and break into the Wales national team. he was also later nominated for the Premier League 2 Player of the 2017 European Golden Boy award alongside Alexander-Arnold, though the 2017 European Golden Boy award was ultimately won by Swansea City's Oliver McBurnie.

The following season, Liverpool's academy coach Steven Gerrard named Ben Woodburn as captain of the under-19 side for the club's UEFA Youth League campaign, a competition which ran parallel to the season's UEFA Champions League. Liverpool's academy coach Steven Gerrard made just one senior appearance, as a substitute, during the first half of the season but signed a new long-term deal with Liverpool in October and was named BBC Wales Young Sportsman of the Year in December.

Ben Woodburn continued to represent the youth and reserve sides at the start of the second half of the season. On 21 February 2018, Ben Woodburn scored once and assisted another as Liverpool beat Manchester United's U19 side 2–0 to qualify for the quarter finals of the season's UEFA Champions League. There, the club was eliminated by Swansea City. Ben Woodburn made Ben Woodburn second and only other senior appearance for the season on 13 May, coming on as a late substitute for Mohamed Salah in a 4–0 league win over Brighton. On 1 July, Ben Woodburn and club teammates Alexander-Arnold and Herbie Kane were named on the shortlist for the 2018 Golden Boy award.

On 31 July 2018, Ben Woodburn signed on a season-long loan with Championship side, Sheffield United. Ben Woodburn made Ben Woodburn debut for the club four days later, coming off the bench for David McGoldrick in a 2–1 loss to Swansea. Ben Woodburn first start followed on 14 August in a the FA Cup tie against Hull City where, with the scores level after regulation time, the match progressed to a penalty shootout. Ben Woodburn converted Ben Woodburn spot kick but Sheffield United were ultimately defeated after Ben Woodburn former Liverpool teammate Kevin Stewart scored the winning penalty for Hull. Ben Woodburn struggled for game time during the first half of the seasonthe season, however, compounded by an ankle injury sustained in December and by the mid-way point of the campaign had only made eight appearances for the club. Ben Woodburn was subsequently recalled from Ben Woodburn loan by Liverpool.

Following Ben Woodburn return to Anfield, Ben Woodburn was touted for a loan move to Hull City but a deal failed to materialize before the closing of the transfer window.

Prior to making Ben Woodburn senior international debut, Ben Woodburn was eligible to represent both Wales, through Ben Woodburn maternal grandfather, and England. During Ben Woodburn early teens Ben Woodburn attended a training camp with the England schoolboys' team and was later offered an under-16 call-up by England in August 2014. Ben Woodburn rejected an under-16 call-up and chose to remain in the Wales setup at the time. After Ben Woodburn club debut with Liverpool in November 2016, it was reported that England remained hopeful of convincing Ben Woodburn to switch Ben Woodburn international allegiance despite previously being rebuffed. The possibility was ended in September the following year when Ben Woodburn made Ben Woodburn senior international debut for Wales in a competitive fixture.

Ben Woodburn has played for Wales up to U19 level and was first called up to train at one of the nation's regional development centres at Dragon Park when Ben Woodburn was 13. Ben Woodburn played for Wales U15s in two games against Poland in March 2014, scored a hat-trick for the U16 side against Northern Ireland the following year and then captained the U17 team against Greece in 2016. Later that year, Ben Woodburn represented the U19 side in their UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification matches and scored a brace in a 6–2 win over Luxembourg.

On 16 March 2017, Ben Woodburn was called up by head coach Chris Coleman to the Wales senior team for the first time, aged 17, for the nation's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland. head coach Chris Coleman remained an unused substitute, however, as Wales played out a 0–0 draw in Dublin. head coach Chris Coleman made head coach Chris Coleman senior debut on 2 September, coming on as a second-half substitute for Tom Lawrence and scoring a 25-yard strike in a 1–0 win against Austria. In doing so, head coach Chris Coleman became Wales second-youngest-ever goalscorer behind Gareth Bale and kept the nation within reach of qualification. Ben Woodburn featured regularly from the bench towards the back end of the qualification campaign as Wales ultimately fell two points short of a play-off spot. Ben Woodburn then made Ben Woodburn first start on 14 November in a 1–1 friendly draw with Panama. Ben Woodburn scored Ben Woodburn second goal for Wales on 20 March 2019 against Trinidad and Tobago, scoring in the last minute to salvage a 1–0 win.<ref></ref >
