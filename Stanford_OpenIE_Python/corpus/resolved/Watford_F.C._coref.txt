 proved Heurelho Gomes

 to be a reliable goalkeeper. Heurelho Gomes

Also before the start of the match and second half, Gomes jumps up above the goal with Gomes shoulders, pumping up the PSV supporters.

Gomes was a crowd favorite at PSV. Gomes can speak Portuguese and Spanish and while in the Netherlands, Gomes picked up a fair amount of Dutch, although it has to be said Gomes is not fluent in the language.

Tottenham Hotspur reputation took a hit a week later, however, when Tottenham Hotspur conceded a weak shot from Ashley Young in Spurs 2–1 home defeat against Aston Villa. These blunders continued as Tottenham Hotspur conceded an own goal in a London derby against Fulham on 15 November 2008, which kept Tottenham Hotspur club mired deep in the relegation zone and also caused Spurs goalkeeping coach Hans Leitert to be sacked on 19 November 2008, with the appointment of former Spurs goalkeeper Tony Parks made shortly after.

Tottenham Hotspur lost the match 4–3 after going 4–0 down inside the first 35 minutes, despite a second half hat-trick from Gareth Bale.

Francisco 'Kiko' Femenía Far (; born 2 February 1991) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right back for Premier League club WatfordPremier League club Watford.

Born in Sanet y Negrals, Alicante, Valencian Community, Femenía was a product of Hércules CF's youth ranks. Femenía made Femenía first-team debut on 15 June 2008 at just 17, appearing in a Segunda División match at Cádiz CF, a 1–1 draw which eventually certified the Andalusians' relegation even though the Andalusians' relegation protested against the illegal fielding of an opposing player, specifically the youngster.

During the 2008–09 season, Femenía played another game with the main squad, again in the last round but against UD Salamanca (5–1 away win). In the subsequent off-season, he signed he first professional contract after penning a five-year link and, in the following campaign, still only 18, he would be a much more important midfield unit, being the first substitute for veteran Francisco Rufete and appearing in nearly 1,000 minutes in Premier League to help the club return to La Liga after an absence of 13 years.

On 28 August 2010, Femenía made he debut in the top division, replacing Abel Aguilar in the second half of the home fixture against Athletic Bilbao: after only a few minutes on the pitch, however, and a couple of poor decisions, he suffered an anxiety attack from which he later fully recovered, although the Basques eventually won it 1–0.

Femenía joined FC Barcelona B on 6 July 2011, for €2 million plus €1.5 million in add-ons. he scored he first official goal for he new team on 4 September, opening the score in a 4–0 away win against FC Cartagena.

Femenía netted five times in 30 games – 23 starts – in Femenía first season, helping the Catalans to the eighth position.

In late August 2013, Femenía was released by Spanish club Barcelona, stating that Femenía had been "ruined emotionally". Just hours later, Femenía signed for Real Madrid, being assigned to the reserves in the second level.

Femenía appeared in only five matches during the whole campaign, which ended in relegation, and left the club in December 2014.

On 7 January 2015, Femenía signed a six-month deal with AD Alcorcón also in the second tier. Femenía totalled 996 minutes of action during the season, helping his new team finish 11th.

On 2 July 2015, Femenía moved to fellow league side Deportivo Alavés after agreeing to a one-year contract. Femenía contributed with 38 appearances and five goals in Femenía debut campaign as they returned to the top flight after ten years, and was eventually reconverted into a right back.

Femenía left the club on 6 June 2017, as Femenía contract was due to expire.

On 1 July 2017, Femenía signed for Premier League club Watford after agreeing to a four-year deal. Femenía made Femenía debut in Premier League on 12 August, coming on for injured Daryl Janmaat early into a 3–3 home draw against Liverpool.

Femenía scored Femenía first league goal for the English club on 31 March 2018, helping the hosts earn one point after a 2–2 home draw to Bournemouth.
