Nine minutes into the match against Blackburn Rovers, Iain Turner was sent off for handling outside the area.

[I] ... went to watch Paul Lambert for Crewe at MK Dons ... but Paul Lambert had an absolute stinker. We also saw Paul Lambert when Paul Lambert was at Stockport and ... I decided against Paul Lambert at that time, but when Michael Fraser went and it was clear We wouldn't be able to get Paul Lambert back again I knew John had had a really good season at Scottish Premier League club Motherwell. There was that clamour to sign Michael Fraser, but with the finances We just couldn't do that. I wanted somebody with the same stature, a big goalkeeper, and John had that."
