Alex McCarthy

Alex Simon McCarthy (born 3 December 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Southampton and the England national team.

A product of Reading's Academy, McCarthy spent time out on loan in the Conference Premier before signing professional terms with the club in 2008. He made his Football League debut in 2009 whilst on loan to Aldershot Town and spent the following season at Yeovil Town before making his Reading debut in 2011. He has since spent time on loan at Leeds United and Ipswich Town. McCarthy left for Queens Park Rangers in 2014.

At international level McCarthy has represented England and made his debut for the under-21 team in 2010, appearing three times in total. In November 2018, he made his debut for the senior team.

Born in Guildford, Surrey, McCarthy began his career as a schoolboy at Wimbledon and Wycombe Wanderers before joining Reading on a scholarship at 16. He was a regular in the Academy team for two years and was part of a group that included several future first-team players including Jem Karacan, Alex Pearce and Gylfi Sigurðsson. His first experience of senior football came in August 2007 on loan at Woking where he made one appearance cover for the injured Nick Gindre. On 26 March 2008, he joined fellow Conference Premier team Cambridge United on work experience, making his debut two days later in a 3–0 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers. He made no further appearances and returned to Reading before signing his first professional contract in July 2008. McCarthy moved on loan again on 24 October 2008, joining Conference South team Team Bath as injury cover. He made his debut the next day in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round against Salisbury City and also played in the first round defeat to Forest Green Rovers, making four appearances in total. Another short loan spell followed with McCarthy joining League Two club Aldershot Town for one month on 2 February 2009. He made his Football League debut 12 days later in a 3–2 defeat to Exeter City and played three further matches before returning to Reading at the beginning of March.

At the start of the 2009–10 season McCarthy joined League One club Yeovil on an initial six-month loan and made his debut on 8 August in a 2–0 home win over Tranmere Rovers. A month later he received the first sending-off of his career after fouling Stockport County's Nicholas Bignall, who was also on loan from Reading. McCarthy's loan spell was renewed in January 2010 and again in February, before being extended for the rest of the season on 24 March. Over the course of his spell he played 44 league matches and kept all 12 of Yeovil's clean sheets. Following his successful loan, McCarthy was given a new three-year contract at Reading, keeping him with the club until 2013. He again departed on loan in August 2010, joining Brentford, though he remained there for just one month before being replaced by fellow Reading loanee Ben Hamer.

After returning from loan at Brentford in September 2010, McCarthy spent the next five months on the bench as cover for Adam Federici. He eventually made his Reading debut on 19 February 2011, coming on as a substitute for the injured Federici in the 84th minute against Watford and helping to secure a 1–1 draw. With Federici out for six weeks with knee ligament damage, McCarthy had a run in the team and made his full debut three days later in a 2–1 win over Millwall. In his next outing he saved a penalty against Crystal Palace as Reading twice came from behind to draw the match 3–3. He also played an important role in the 1–0 FA Cup fifth round win over Everton, producing a late save to deny Leon Osman in a performance described as "tremendous" by former England manager Kevin Keegan. Despite another strong display in the next round against Manchester City at Eastlands, Reading lost the match 1–0 to a Micah Richards header. He continued in goal until 30 April when he was displaced by a fit again Federici for the 0–0 draw at Coventry City and remained an unused substitute during Reading's play-off campaign.

With Federici remaining the first choice Reading goalkeeper for the 2011–12 season, McCarthy was loaned to Leeds United for a month on 4 November to gain Championship experience. An injury to Andy Lonergan and the indifferent form of Paul Rachubka saw him go straight into the team for the match against Leicester City. He kept a clean sheet on debut as the match ended in a 1–0 win. Further clean sheets against Nottingham Forest and Millwall followed and were enough to keep him in the team ahead of the returning Lonergan. In the last match of his initial spell he saved an injury time penalty against Watford, allowing Leeds to rescue a point with a last minute equaliser. Following the match, he revealed that he was keen on extending his loan at Leeds, with Reading agreeing to renew it for a second month two days later. Ineligible to face his parent club on 17 December, he was replaced by Lonergan and made no further appearances, returning to Reading on 3 January 2012. He signed a new three-year contract with Reading on 9 January before joining Ipswich Town on loan until the end of the season. On his return to Elland Road with Ipswich he was sent off for handling the ball outside the penalty area with 20 minutes remaining. Ipswich, one goal up at the time, went on to lose the match 3–1. After 10 appearances, all coming in the league, he returned to Reading at the end of the season.

Again starting the season as second choice goalkeeper, several mistakes and an injury meant McCarthy replaced Adam Federici for the 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 16 September 2012. After debuting in the Premier League, he achieved the feat of playing in the six top levels of English football at the age of 22. He retained his place in the team for the next few matches and put in an impressive performance against Swansea City on 6 October leading to suggestions of a senior England call up in the future. His good form continued with a man of the match performance in Reading's next match against Queens Park Rangers, firstly tipping Esteban Granero's free-kick onto the crossbar before saving from Adel Taarabt at close range. The match ended badly though as he injured himself colliding with the goal post after diving to stop a Taarabt shot. Despite initial hopes the injury was not too serious, he was forced to undergo shoulder surgery in early December potentially ruling him out for remainder of the season. He recovered quicker than expected though and returned to the team on 13 April 2013, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with Liverpool. After making ten saves during the match, he was widely praised with his performance described as "fantastic" by Nigel Adkins and "absolutely staggering" by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He remained in goal for the rest of the season, making 14 appearances in total.

On 29 August 2014, McCarthy joined newly promoted Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League for an undisclosed fee. McCarthy made his Rangers debut at home against Liverpool in a blockbuster narrow 3–2 defeat.

On 23 July 2015, McCarthy joined Premier League club Crystal Palace for an undisclosed fee, reported to be £3.5 million, on a four-year contract. McCarthy made his Palace debut on 8 August 2015 in a 3–1 win away to Norwich City.

On 1 August 2016, he joined Southampton on a three-year contract, for an undisclosed fee.

McCarthy was initially used as back-up to regular keeper, Fraser Forster, but on 30 December 2017 he took over from the latter, following the regular goalkeeper's drop in form.

On 27 June 2018, McCarthy signed a new four-year contract with the club, keeping him on their books until 2020, and making him one of their highest earning players, reflecting his status as first-choice keeper.

McCarthy trained with the England under-19s before joining the under-21 set-up for the first time in September 2009. He received several further call-ups to the under-21s in 2009–10 and eventually made his debut as a second-half substitute against Uzbekistan in August 2010. In March 2011 he was named in a 31-man squad to face Denmark and Iceland as preparation for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played a full 90 minutes in the first match and 45 in the second as England won 4–0 and lost 2–1 respectively. He travelled with the squad to championships in Denmark but did not play any matches, finishing with three caps at under-21 level.

In April 2012, McCarthy was named in the 80-man longlist of potential players for the Great Britain football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and in June, he made it down to the shortlist of 35 players provisionally selected for the tournament, although he did not make the final 18.

In May 2013 he was called up to the England senior team for the friendlies against Republic of Ireland and Brazil, becoming the first Reading youth team graduate to gain a full England call-up since the Academy era began in 1998, although he did not make an appearance. On 1 September 2016, he was called up to the senior squad again by Sam Allardyce to replace the injured Fraser Forster for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovakia.

In August 2018, McCarthy was called up for England's first squad since the 2018 World Cup, for matches against Spain and Switzerland. He made his debut on 15 November as a half-time substitute in England's 3–0 win over the United States at Wembley Stadium in a friendly, nearly five and a half years to the day after his first call-up.

Shane Long

Shane Patrick Long (born 22 January 1987) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Southampton and the Republic of Ireland national team. He also played hurling for Tipperary in his early life.

Long began his football career at Cork City. He later moved to Reading where, among other achievements, he scored three goals in ten substitute appearances during his team's Championship-winning 2005–06 campaign, guided his team into the Fourth round of the FA Cup by defeating Liverpool in a third round replay match in 2010, and later won a player of the season award. He signed for Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in 2011 for a fee of £6 million, and joined Hull City in January 2014, then Southampton in August 2014.

Long made his senior debut for the Republic of Ireland in 2007, and has since earned 80 international caps.

Long was born in Gortnahoe, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was a talented hurler and appeared in two All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship (Under-18) semi-finals with Tipperary at Croke Park, and was regarded as a pacey and promising forward. Long was also playing Gaelic football at this time, and started his career in the game with Two-Mile Borris club St Kevin's FC in 1994, joining St. Michael's in Tipperary Town in 2002.

Long was discovered and brought to Cork City with a scholarship on 1 July 2004 by Pat Dolan. He was called to the first team squad for the 2005 season when manager Dolan was replaced by Damien Richardson, and the new manager awarded him his senior League of Ireland debut on 25 March 2005 as a substitute for Joe Gamble. His only other appearance was again as a substitute in the Setanta Sports Cup on 2 May. However, following Dolan's consultation with his brother, Reading coach Eamonn Dolan, Reading made bids for both Long and Kevin Doyle. Cork were forced to sell Doyle due to a contract clause, but the circumstances surrounding Long's transfer were not disclosed. Long signed as a Reading player on 7 June 2005.

In Reading's Championship-winning 2005–06 campaign, Long scored three goals in ten substitute appearances, making his first league start on 17 April 2006 in the 3–1 home victory against Stoke City. For the first season, he was mostly second choice in the pecking order behind fellow Irishman Kevin Doyle, Dave Kitson and Leroy Lita. He started all of the games in Reading's FA Cup campaign and scored one goal.

On 4 July 2007, Long signed an improved four-year contract to keep him at Reading until the end of the 2010–11 season.

On 16 March 2008, in a 2–1 defeat at Anfield against Liverpool, Long was involved in an incident as to where he flung his shirt to the ground, citing frustration at his performance and frustration with the match official Andre Marriner, after being subbed by manager Steve Coppell. In the post-match interview, Steve Coppell made a stern point in that "it will not happen again". Long made a full apology on the official club website.

His 2008–09 season ended happily after scoring an equaliser in a 1–1 draw at Southampton, before ending the season with a brace in a 2–0 victory at Norwich City.

In the 2010 FA Cup third round replay match against Liverpool, Long was fouled by Yossi Benayoun to win a 93rd-minute penalty as Liverpool led 1–0 at Anfield to bring the match into extra time. Long then scored a glancing header in the 100th minute in front of the Anfield Kop from a cross supplied by Brynjar Gunnarsson, which sent Reading into the Fourth round of the FA Cup to play at home against Burnley.

On 30 January 2010, Long scored a crucial goal at home to strugglers Barnsley that gifted Reading all three points in a 1–0 win for the Royals.
The following Saturday, his good run of form continued with an opening goal which contributed to a 2–1 win away to Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium.
His goalscoring continued, as on 9 February 2010, he scored a brace in a 2–1 win at home to Plymouth Argyle, giving Reading their third consecutive league victory and Long's fourth goal in three games.

On 13 February 2010, however, in an FA Cup fifth round match at home to West Bromwich Albion, Long was sent off for a careless lunge at West Brom Ivorian defender Abdoulaye Méïté. It was his second-straight dismissible offence of the season, the first procured away to Derby County in a Championship match in November. On 7 March 2010, in Reading's FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, Long scored a brace in the first half, which saw Reading leading 2–0 at half-time. However, a hat-trick from Norwegian striker John Carew and a strike from Ashley Young in the second-half saw Long's brace go to waste as Aston Villa booked themselves a place in the semi-finals.
On 2 May 2010, Long played his 150th game for Reading in the 4–1 Championship win over Preston North End at the Madejski Stadium.

On 11 September 2010, Long won two penalties and converted the first in Reading's 3–0 win over Crystal Palace. On 4 November, Shane Long signed a one-year contract extension, valid until 2012. On 18 December, he scored twice against Derby, which led to his best goal-scoring form of his life. He followed up with a brace against Bristol City on Boxing Day. On 3 January 2011, Long scored another brace to give Reading the three points against Burnley in a 2–1 victory. On 8 January 2011, Long then hit the only goal in the FA Cup's third round encounter with West Brom. After an impressive season for Reading, Long won the Player of the Season award, beating Jimmy Kébé and Jem Karacan.

Long scored two goals for Reading on 17 May 2011 in a 3–0 away win against Cardiff City in the second leg of the Championship Play-off semi-finals; one goal came from the penalty spot and the other a lob after a blocked clearance from Cardiff goalkeeper Stephen Bywater. Long received the Man of the Match award for his efforts. He finished the season with 28 goals in 58 matches for club and country, the best season in his career to date. After the play-off final defeat against Swansea City, Reading chairman John Madejski declared Long to be world-class: "What is the value I would place on him? £20m."

On 9 August 2011, Long signed for Premier League side West Bromwich Albion on a three-year deal, with a further year's option. Although the fee was undisclosed, it is believed to be £4.5 million, with add-ons that could eventually rise to £6.5 million, which would be a record fee for West Bromwich, surpassing the £4.7 million paid for Spanish international midfielder Borja Valero from Mallorca in 2008. On 12 August, Long was handed the number 9 shirt, and two days later made his debut in the league opener against Manchester United at The Hawthorns. He marked his debut by scoring an equalising goal that went past Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, albeit in a losing effort, 2–1. Long scored again in the fourth minute of his second match, against Chelsea on 20 August 2011, in what proved to be yet another 2–1 defeat. Long scored his third goal in the fifth minute against Sunderland on 1 October, his seventh game of the season. The match ended 2–2 with James Morrison also scoring on the fourth minute. On 16 October 2011, Long was named man of the match in the Black Country derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers, despite not scoring. The match ended 2–0 to West Brom, with Chris Brunt scoring in the eighth minute and Peter Odemwingie scoring in the 76th minute. Long suffered a chipped bone in his knee after a match against Aston Villa after a robust challenge by Alan Hutton, ruling him out for approximately six weeks. On 19 November, weeks before he was predicted injury-free, he played 90 minutes against Bolton Wanderers, a game which Albion won 2–1, with Long scoring what proved to be the winner with a header against a much more physical opponent in David Wheater. On 3 December, Long scored a goal off a deflected shot in the last minutes a match against Queens Park Rangers earning Albion a draw by leveling the game at 1–1. Long once again found the net on 25 March against Newcastle United, with a consolation goal in a 1–3 defeat. On the final day of the season, he scored in a 2–3 defeat against Arsenal to finish his debut season for West Brom with eight Premier League goals.

In 2012–13 season, he started off the season very brightly after winning two penalties against Liverpool. Although he missed the first penalty, he won the second, which Peter Odemwingie converted. He continued his good form with Premier League goals against Everton, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Chelsea and Sunderland, as well as a brace against Yeovil Town in the second round of the Football League Cup, to put him on seven goals for the season by the end of November. He finished the season with 11 goals in all competitions, supplemented with two goals for Republic of Ireland.

On the final day of the summer transfer window for the 2013–14 season, a move to Hull City valued at £5 million fell through at the last moment, after West Brom manager Steve Clarke pulled out from the transfer. Clarke stated that Long was needed, as he did not have enough attacking options, despite signing Stéphane Sessègnon and Victor Anichebe just minutes earlier both for £6 million fees from Sunderland and Everton respectively. After limited starts at the beginning of the season, Long started and scored his first of the season against Chelsea away at Stamford Bridge. The game finished 2–2. Long continued his good run of form against Aston Villa with two superb goals in the first 11 minutes, later being named Man of the Match.

On 17 January 2014, Long signed for Hull City for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal. Long made his debut on 28 January 2014 away at Crystal Palace in a 1–0 defeat. In his next match, at home to Tottenham Hotspur on 1 February 2014, Long opened the scoring in a 1–1 draw. On 22 March 2014, he played in his first match against previous club West Brom at the KC Stadium. Despite a warm reception before the game from the travelling West Brom fans, he won a penalty for Hull after 30 minutes, which has been interpreted as a dive by the West Brom supporters. From then, West Brom fans booed his every touch, and he scored his third Hull goal before half time, cementing a 2–0 win for Hull.

Long played in both legs of Hull's Europa League qualifying tie against AS Trencín before the start of the 2014–15 Premier League season. They were his last official matches for Hull, as on 14 August 2014, Long signed a four-year contract with Southampton for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £12 million.

Three days later, he made his first appearance for the club, replacing fellow debutant Dušan Tadić for the final 16 minutes of a 2–1 defeat at Liverpool in Southampton's opening game of the league season. He almost scored a late equaliser when he nodded a header just wide of the post. Long scored his first Southampton goal against Stoke City in the League Cup on 29 October, putting his team 2–0 up in a 3–2 victory.

He scored his first league goals for the club with a brace in a 2–0 win over Leicester City, having come on as a substitute for Sadio Mané with 22 minutes remaining.

On 16 May 2015, Long assisted teammate Sadio Mané twice inside three minutes as the latter scored the fastest ever hat-trick in the history of the Premier League during the first half of a 6–1 demolition of Aston Villa. Later on in the first half, Long himself scored twice to give the Saints a 5–0 lead five minutes from half-time. The second of these efforts was a 35-yard lob which was named as Southampton's Goal of the Season.

In his first appearance the following season, Long scored Southampton's final goal in a 3–0 victory over Dutch opponents Vitesse Arnhem at St Mary's Stadium in the first leg of the Europa League third qualifying round. He scored his first Premier League goal of the season on the opening weekend, coming off the bench against Newcastle to head the score level, bringing the game to 2–2. On 26 December 2015, Long scored two goals against Arsenal in a game that ended 4–0 to Southampton. He scored his 100th career goal in English football in the 4–2 home win over Manchester City on 1 May 2016.

On 21 July 2016, Long signed a new contract with Southampton, extending his stay with the club until 2020.

He ended a barren run of 23 games without a goal for Southampton on 31 December 2016, when he headed in against West Bromwich Albion at St. Mary's to give the home side a 1–0 lead. The match finished 2–1 to the visitors.

Long's form for Reading in the 2005–06 season earned him four Republic of Ireland U19 caps. Due to injuries to his Reading teammate Kevin Doyle and Sunderland's Stephen Elliott, he earned his first senior cap for the Republic of Ireland in their 2–1 win away to San Marino on 7 February 2007.

When Long earned his second cap as a substitute against Slovakia on 28 March 2007 he became the first person to play both hurling and international football at Croke Park, having been part of the Tipperary team for the All-Ireland Minor semi-finals in 2003 and 2004. Long scored his first international goal in a friendly 1–1 draw against Bolivia on 26 May 2007, and followed this with a brace in Ireland's 4–0 win over Denmark on 22 August 2007. He was nominated as the Football Association of Ireland Young Player of the Year for 2007.

In March 2011, Long was brought on early to replace the injured Kevin Doyle in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Macedonia in Dublin. His performance was rewarded with a start in Ireland's next game against Uruguay in which Long scored the first of Ireland's goals with a header in a 2–3 loss. On 26 May 2012, Long scored when he headed the winner in a 1–0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He played in UEFA Euro 2012, coming off the bench against Croatia and Italy.

On 29 May 2013, Long scored his ninth goal for Ireland, a header against England at Wembley Stadium, a match which finished 1–1. He then captained Ireland for the first time on 2 June 2013 against Georgia, a match which Ireland won 4–0. On 5 March 2014, Long scored his 11th goal for his country in a 2–1 loss to Serbia.
On 29 March 2015, Long came off the bench to score a last-minute equaliser against Poland in 2016 Euro qualifier. On 8 October 2015, Long again came off the bench to score the winning goal against reigning world champions Germany in another 2016 Euro qualifier in the Aviva Stadium.

Danny Ings

Daniel William John Ings (born 23 July 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Southampton, on loan from fellow club Liverpool, and the England national team.

Ings started his career in the youth team of Southampton but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined AFC Bournemouth, progressing through their youth system, while also spending time at Dorchester Town on loan. In 2011 Ings joined Burnley with whom he won the 2013–14 Championship Player of the Year, and helped them achieve promotion to the Premier League. Following Burnley's relegation, and the expiry of his contract with the club, Ings moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2015, but his first season at Anfield was ended after two months due to injury. His second season with Liverpool was also mired by injury, with Ings only making two League Cup appearances throughout the 2016–17 season. Ings joined Southampton on loan in August 2018, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.

Formerly an under-21 international, Ings made his senior debut for England in October 2015.

Ings was born in Winchester, Hampshire and grew up in Netley, Hampshire. As a child he attended Netley Abbey Primary School and Hamble Community Sports College. Ings dreamed of playing for local club Southampton, but was rejected for being too small. He signed for Southampton from Netley Central Sports, before being released as a school boy. After his release, Ings played for Itchen Tyro. He subsequently signed a two-year apprentice contract with AFC Bournemouth in May 2008, having progressed through the club's Centre of Excellence while he was still at secondary school at Hamble Community Sports College. He had also previously had experience playing for the reserve team. He made his professional debut for Bournemouth on 6 October 2009, in a 2–1 away defeat to Northampton Town in the Football League Trophy, replacing Jason Tindall in the second half as a substitute. His second season in the youth team was blighted by a long-term abdominal injury, which restricted his playing time. He remained with the youth team until the summer of 2010, when he signed a short-term three-month contract. He extended his contract in September 2010, until the end of the 2010–11 campaign.

In September 2010, he was sent on an initial one-month loan to Conference South club Dorchester Town. His debut for the Magpies came on 11 September 2010, scoring the equaliser in a 2–1 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United. His second goal for Dorchester came on 24 September, scoring a penalty in a 4–1 win over Mangotsfield United in the FA Cup. On 6 October, his loan was extended for a further month. His next goal came in a 4–1 defeat to Havant & Waterlooville as the Magpies were knocked out of the FA Cup. On 16 October, he scored the second in a 2–0 league win over Lewes, after coming on as a late substitute for Giuseppe Sole. He got his fifth goal in a 2–1 away win over Staines Town, scoring the opener. His first goal in November came in a 2–1 home defeat to Maidenhead United, which ended an unbeaten run of six matches. On 12 November 2010, his loan was extended for a third time for an additional month. He scored the second in a 3–1 win over Weston-super-Mare in the FA Trophy to help them progress to the next round. On 23 November, his spell at Dorchester was cut short as he was recalled from his loan by Bournemouth due to an injury crisis at the club.

On 30 November, he signed a new contract extension which lasted until 2012. He made his league debut and first start for Bournemouth on 28 December 2010, in a 2–0 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons in League One, where he was substituted off in the first half for Steve Fletcher. He started to become a first-team regular and scored his first professional goal against Swindon Town on 1 February 2011, in a 3–2 win at Dean Court. His form saw him rewarded with a new contract extension, lasting until 2013. On 26 February 2011, he scored a header to equalise in 2–1 win away at Dagenham & Redbridge in the league. On 1 April he added to his tally with a goal against Peterborough United in a 3–3 draw. He went through a rich vein of goalscoring from in April, scoring four goals in three matches. He scored an overhead kick to equalise in the last minute against Tranmere Rovers, however, the Cherries went on to lose the match 2–1. He also scored in a 2–0 away victory over Notts County. He scored his first brace in a 2–2 draw with Yeovil Town, including one penalty. His final goal for Bournemouth came in the last match of the season, in the play-off semi-final defeat to Huddersfield Town, as Bournemouth were knocked out on penalties.

In the summer of 2011, he was linked with reported moves away from Bournemouth with Celtic, Liverpool and Newcastle United. Premier League club Fulham also had a £400,000 bid rejected by the club. In July 2011, he was rewarded with his fifth contract in twelve months, improving his deal to be one of the top earners at the club. He remained at the club through pre-season and started in the first match of the season in a 3–0 away defeat to Charlton Athletic. It proved to be his final appearance for the club.

On 15 August 2011, Ings signed for Championship club Burnley for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1 million, on a four-year contract. He rejoined former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe who had made the same move eight months earlier.

He made his debut on 14 February 2012, in a 2–0 win over Barnsley at Turf Moor, where he came on as a late substitute for Charlie Austin. His first start came a month later on 10 March 2012, in a 1–1 home draw with Crystal Palace in the league. His first goal for Burnley came on 31 March, in a 5–1 win against Portsmouth at Fratton Park. His second goal came in the following match, where he scored the equaliser in a 3–1 defeat to Birmingham City. He scored his third goal of the season in the final match of the season, a 30-yard strike in a 1–1 home draw with Bristol City.

He started the 2012–13 season as a first choice regular in pre-season following the sale of striker Jay Rodriguez to Southampton. He scored in friendly wins over Altrincham and Bury. He suffered another serious knee injury in the final pre-season match, a 3–1 defeat to Rochdale. He tore the knee cartilage in the opposite knee to the previous season which resulted in surgery, keeping him out of action for up to six months.

Following the departure of top-scorer Charlie Austin to Queens Park Rangers, Ings became the main striker ahead of the 2013–14 season. He put together a string of impressive performances in the Clarets' pre-season campaign and scored two goals in the opening three league matches as well as a goal in the League Cup against York City. For his continued good start to the season Ings was named the Championship Player of the Month for October.

In March 2014, Ings won Championship Player of the Year at the Football League Awards, ahead of the two other nominees: Leeds United striker Ross McCormack and Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater. He ended the 2013–14 Championship season with 22 goals as Burnley finished second and gained promotion to the Premier League.

On 19 August 2014, Ings made his Premier League debut in a 3–1 loss to Chelsea at Turf Moor. His first Premier League goal came in a 1–3 defeat to Everton on 26 October.

On 22 November 2014, Ings scored both of Burnley's goals in a 2–1 win at Stoke City for their first away win of the Premier League season, his two goals coming in the space of two minutes. He made his 100th league appearance for Burnley in a 1–0 win against Southampton on 13 December.

During January and February 2015, Ings scored five goals in six Premier League matches, helping the team to achieve draws with Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion, and defeat Queens Park Rangers. In May, he scored the winning goal in 1–0 victories over Hull City and Aston Villa respectively to end the season with 11 goals from 35 league appearances.

On 8 June 2015, Liverpool announced that they had agreed on personal terms with Ings, subject to a medical, as well as a developmental fee due to Burnley for players under 24, to be negotiated between two clubs or determined by a tribunal. Under tribunal the fee would be decided by the Professional Football Compensation Committee. On 28 April 2016, the saga was finally settled. Liverpool would pay Burnley a record fee for a tribunal hearing: £6.5 million up front, with an extra £1.5 million in player performance-related bonuses. Burnley will also receive 20% of any future fee should Liverpool sell the striker.

Ings made his competitive debut on 29 August 2015 in a 3–0 defeat against West Ham at Anfield. He made his European debut for the club on 17 September in the UEFA Europa League group stage match against Bordeaux, as a substitute for Divock Origi in a 1–1 draw. Three days later, he replaced Christian Benteke at half time and within three minutes scored his first Liverpool goal in a 1–1 draw against Norwich City. On 4 October 2015, he opened a draw of the same score against Everton in the Merseyside derby.

On 15 October 2015, in his first training session under new manager Jürgen Klopp, Ings suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. However, Ings returned sooner than anticipated, making a substitute appearance in the final match of the season, a 1–1 draw away to West Bromwich Albion. Ings began the 2016–17 season playing in the reserves to help regain fitness. On 25 October 2016, Ings sustained damage to his right knee in a League Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur that would require another spell on the sidelines of up to 9 months. He successfully underwent surgery to repair the damage to his knee and began rehabilitation at Melwood on 9 November.

On 19 September 2017, Ings made his first appearance in 11 months since the injury when he came on as a second-half substitute in the 2–0 defeat to Leicester City in the EFL Cup. On 21 April 2018, he scored his first goal after his return from injury in a 2–2 draw with West Brom. This was his first goal since 2015 and also his first goal under Jürgen Klopp.

After struggling playing time in the 2017–18 season due to the form of attackers Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah, and Sadio Mané, Ings requested a move away from Liverpool in the summer of 2018. Ings was a popular figure in the dressing room and Jurgen Klopp was reluctant to let him leave in spite of his limited appearances in the previous season. Ings joined Premier League club Southampton on 9 August 2018 on an initial loan until the end of the season, which would become permanent on 1 July 2019, for a reported fee of £18 million, plus a possible further £2 million based on appearances. On 12 August, he made his debut as a second-half substitute in a goalless draw with former club Burnley. He then scored on his first start five days later in a 2–1 defeat to Everton before netting the opening goal in Southampton's 2–0 win over Crystal Palace at the start of the following month, helping the club to their first win of the campaign.

On 3 October 2013, Ings received his first international call-up to the England national under-21 team by manager Gareth Southgate. He made his debut a week later as a substitute in a 4–0 win away to San Marino. He won his second cap in the reverse fixture on 19 November, and scored twice as England won 9–0 against San Marino at the New Meadow. He earned 13 caps and scored four goals for the under-21s from 2013 to 2015.

On 1 October 2015, Ings received his first international call-up to the full England national team from manager Roy Hodgson, for the final UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Estonia and Lithuania. He made his debut in the latter match on 12 October, replacing Harry Kane after 59 minutes of an eventual 3–0 win in Vilnius.

Off the field, Ings has gained a reputation for charitable acts. In November 2014, he launched and funded the Danny Ings Disability Sport Project to provide football coaching to children with disabilities and learning difficulties after being inspired to do so by a young disabled Burnley fan. His father Shayne Ings initially played as a winger and then as a full back for Hampshire-based Netley Central Sports. He still works as a self-employed bricklayer and the family still live in the same house in Netley.

Charlie Austin

Charles Austin (born 5 July 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Southampton.

Released from his contract by Reading as a youth, Austin played non-league football up to May 2009, when he was signed by Swindon Town after a prolific season for Poole Town. After scoring 58 goals in 113 matches in the Football League Championship for Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, Austin made his debut in the Premier League during the 2014–15 season, scoring 18 goals for relegated QPR and receiving a call-up for the England national team. He returned to the Premier League in January 2016 when he signed for Southampton, scoring on his debut.

Born in Hungerford, Berkshire, Austin trained with Reading's youth teams as a youngster but was released for being too small when he was 15. He subsequently played for local team Kintbury Rangers and his hometown side Hungerford Town. Austin departed Hungerford in 2008 and was briefly on the books of Thatcham Town but ultimately left without making any appearances for the club.

Moving with his family to Bournemouth, he then switched to nearby semi-professional Wessex League Premier Division team Poole Town while also working as a bricklayer. In the season of 2008–09, Austin scored 46 goals in 46 appearances for Poole in all competitions.

Austin spent the pre-season of the 2009–10 season on trial with League Two club Bournemouth. Although Bournemouth's manager, Eddie Howe, was keen to sign the striker on a permanent deal, Bournemouth were unable to make a move for the striker due to a transfer embargo imposed on the club by the Football League. Austin continued to play for Poole Town, scoring 18 goals in 11 games at the beginning of the season.

Austin was offered a trial at Swindon Town in September 2009 after Swindon Town's then chief scout Ken Ryder "stumbled across Charlie playing for Poole Town ... and he scored four goals ... and then the following week he scored three or four". After being watched for three games by the Swindon Town scouting team, Austin was asked to go on a week-long trial at Swindon Town. Austin impressed in his first reserve game against Swansea and scored a hat trick. Immediately afterwards, he was signed by Danny Wilson for an undisclosed fee and given a contract until the end of the season. He made his debut appearance for Swindon Town on 6 October in a 1–1 draw with Exeter in the 2009–10 Football League Trophy, replacing Ben Hutchinson as a substitute in the 88th minute. Austin made his Football League debut coming on in the 70th minute in the league match away at Norwich City on 24 October 2009 and on 21 November 2009, he scored his first professional goal in only the third minute of his full debut away at Carlisle United. He scored again on his full home debut three days later against Huddersfield Town, hitting the match-winner in the 59th minute for a 2–1 victory.

After forming a successful strike partnership with Billy Paynter and scoring 10 goals in 11 starts, Austin was rewarded with an extended two-and-a-half-year contract with the club in February 2010. On 14 May 2010, Austin scored the first goal as Swindon took a narrow 2–1 advantage in the first leg of the League One play-off semi-final against Charlton Athletic. In the second leg at Charlton, Swindon progressed to the final at Wembley after a penalty shoot-out in which Austin scored. Swindon lost the final 1–0 against Millwall; Austin found himself through on goal with an opportunity to equalise in the 72nd minute but shot wide after the ball bobbled on the Wembley turf as he struck the ball. At the end of his first season as a professional, Austin had scored 20 goals in 32 starts.

Despite suffering a dislocated shoulder in September, Austin scored another 17 goals in 27 games at the start of the 2010–11 season. His form prompted several Championship clubs to make offers for him during the January transfer window – all of which were rejected by Swindon. Disappointed at Swindon's reluctance to sell, Austin subsequently stated he was eager to play at a higher level and handed in a transfer request. Swindon accepted a bid from Ipswich Town just over a week later but they failed to agree personal terms with Austin and Burnley subsequently stepped in with an undisclosed fee which was also accepted.

On 28 January 2011, Austin signed for Burnley on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He made his Burnley debut on 1 February in a 1–0 loss away to Doncaster Rovers. In his first full season with Burnley, Austin scored 16 goals in the Championship and finished the campaign as the club's top goalscorer in the league.

On 23 October 2012, Austin scored two goals in a 3–4 win over Bristol City, and subsequently equalled Ray Pointer's club record of scoring in eight consecutive appearances, which was achieved back during the 1958–59 season.

Two weeks later, on 6 November 2012, Austin broke another Burnley record as he became the quickest-ever player to reach 20 goals in a season after scoring in a 1–0 win over Leeds United — his 17th appearance of the season. The record was previously held by Bert Freeman, who scored 20 goals in his first 19 matches for the club during the 1911–12 season. He also became only the second-ever Burnley player to score 20 goals before the end of November after Andy Lochhead, who reached 20 goals in 25 games on 26 November 1966.
Austin managed to get his goal tally up to 23 goals by the end of the calendar year.

On 8 July 2013, a fee was agreed between Burnley and Premier League club Hull City for Austin. However, on 9 July 2013, Austin failed his medical and Hull pulled out of the deal.

Austin moved to Queens Park Rangers, on a three-year deal on 1 August 2013, for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for QPR in a League Cup tie against Exeter City on 6 August 2013. On 14 September 2013, Austin scored his first league goal for QPR in a 1–0 win over Birmingham City at Loftus Road. On 28 September 2013, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 win at home to Middlesbrough. On 5 October 2013, he scored two goals including a penalty in a 2–0 win at home to Barnsley which increased his goal tally in the home and away season to 6. He scored his 100th professional goal and his 18th of the season in a 3–2 win over Barnsley. His 20th goal of the 2013–14 season sent QPR to Wembley as his team beat Wigan Athletic 2–1 on 12 May 2014.

On 6 December 2014, Austin scored against former club Burnley in a 2–0 win, but was later sent off for a second booking. Two weeks later, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick in a 3–2 win over West Bromwich Albion, bringing his league tally for the season up to 11. With five goals in five games in December 2014, he was awarded the Premier League Player of the Month award, becoming only the second QPR player to do so. By scoring a league hat-trick for QPR, Austin became the first Rangers player in more than ten years to achieve the feat, last performed by Jamie Cureton on 28 September 2004. On 24 May, Austin scored QPR's goal in a 5–1 final day defeat to Leicester City to finish the season as the fourth top goal scorer in the Premier League, with 18 goals.

On 16 January 2016, Austin returned to the Premier League, joining Southampton on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a reported fee of £4 million. He made his debut for the club a week later against Manchester United, coming on as a second-half substitute for Sadio Mané, and scored a late winner, turning in a free-kick from James Ward-Prowse.

He scored his first two goals of the 2016–17 season on 15 September in a 3–0 Europa League win over Sparta Prague and went on to score four goals in a week, with goals against Swansea City in the Premier League and Crystal Palace in the EFL Cup. In Southampton's next Premier League fixture, at West Ham United, manager Claude Puel inserted Austin in the starting lineup over Shane Long, and Austin provided the first goal as well as an assist in the 3–0 victory.

On 23 December, Austin scored the opening goal in the 24th minute of a 1–1 draw with Huddersfield Town. Shortly afterwards, he caught Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lössl in the face with his boot. Late in the match, Austin went off with a hamstring injury which resulted in him being sidelined for several weeks. The following day, the Football Association gave Austin a 3-match suspension for violent conduct.

On 21 May 2015, Austin was called up for the first time to the England national football team for a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia. He and Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy were called up due to several other forwards being involved in the European Under-21 Championship, but Austin did not feature in either match.

Austin and his long-term partner Bianca Parker have a daughter, born in August 2012.

Austin was found guilty of assault in 2013 after he punched a man who had accused him of taking drugs in a Swindon nightclub toilet cubicle. He was fined £1,800 and ordered to pay £1,320 in costs.

Oriol Romeu

Oriol Romeu Vidal (; born 24 September 1991) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for English club Southampton.

He began his career at Barcelona, playing mainly in its reserves. In 2011, he joined Chelsea for €5 million, spending time on loan at Valencia and VfB Stuttgart before moving to Southampton four years later.

Romeu represented Spain up to under-21 level, and was part of their under-17 team which won the 2008 European Championship. He also played for the country at the 2012 Olympics.

Born in Ulldecona, Tarragona, Catalonia, Romeu started his career at local CF Ulldecona. He arrived in FC Barcelona's youth academy in 2004, from neighbours RCD Espanyol, and progressed through the club's youth academy until breaking into the reserve team. Manager Pep Guardiola handed him his first appearance for the senior side in a friendly against Kuwaiti team Kazma Sporting Club, and subsequently included him in the squad for the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup which took place in Abu Dhabi.

Romeu was included in the nineteen-man Barcelona squad on 13 August 2010, due to the need to rest some of Barça's Spanish internationals. He was to face Sevilla in the first leg of the season's Spanish Supercup. He made his official competitive debut in that game, playing the full ninety minutes in the 1–3 away loss.

Romeu made his first La Liga appearance on 15 May 2011, playing the last ten minutes of a 0–0 home draw against Deportivo de La Coruña in the place of another club youth graduate, Jonathan dos Santos.

Reports began to link Romeu with a move to Chelsea on 22 July 2011. The following day he agreed terms for his transfer, pending a medical or personal terms as he was away on international duty at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. On 4 August the English club announced the completion of the transfer, with the player signing a four-year contract in a deal worth €5 million – the deal also gave Barcelona first refusal via a buy back option should Chelsea deem him surplus to requirements, seeing Barcelona pay €10 million in 2012 or €15 million in 2013 to bring him back to the Camp Nou; he was given the number 6 shirt for the new campaign.

Romeu made his official debut for Chelsea on 10 September 2011, being brought on as a substitute in the 79th minute of the 2–1 away win against Sunderland. He received his first start on the 21st, in a 0–0 draw (penalty shootout win) against Fulham for the season's Football League Cup.

Romeu's first UEFA Champions League appearance came on 19 October 2011, playing the full 90 minutes in a 5–0 group stage home win against K.R.C. Genk. His first start in the Premier League was against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 26 November, putting in a solid performance in a 3–0 home win.

In December 2011, Chelsea issued a statement regarding the deal surrounding Romeu's buy back clause with Barcelona. The statement highlighted that the "Blaugrana" did not have an automatic buy back clause as first suggested, only having first refusal on any deal if the Blues wanted to sell him in the future.

On 25 September 2012 Romeu scored his first goal for Chelsea, taking a penalty in a 6–0 win against Wolves at Stamford Bridge for the season's League Cup. Manager Roberto Di Matteo stated that the departures of Yossi Benayoun, Michael Essien and Raul Meireles would mean more playing opportunities for the Spaniard; however, on 11 December, he suffered a knee injury in a game against Sunderland, being sidelined for the rest of the season.

On 12 July 2013, Romeu returned to Spain and joined Valencia in a season-long loan deal. He made his debut for the club on 15 September, in a 3–1 defeat at Real Betis. In February, during training Romeu suffered another knee injury that kept him out of action for a month. During his time with Valencia, Romeu played a total of 18 games.

On 17 July 2014, Romeu signed a new contract with Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2017. On 4 August, however, he was loaned to VfB Stuttgart from Germany. On 24 August 2014, Romeu made his debut for Stuttgart against Borussia Mönchengladbach which ended in a 1–1 draw.

On 13 August 2015, Romeu joined Southampton for £5 million on a three-year deal. He made his debut two days later, as a half-time substitute for Dušan Tadić in a 3–0 home defeat to Everton, earning a booking after three minutes for a foul on James McCarthy. He scored his first goal for the Saints – and first in a professional league – on 5 December, equalising for a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa at St Mary's Stadium.

After missing only one league game all season for Claude Puel's Saints, Romeu signed a new four-and-a-half-year deal on 24 January 2017.

He participated in the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship with Spain, playing four matches and helping his country to eventual victory in the tournament.

After making his professional début for Barça in 2009, Romeu became a mainstay in the under-19 and under-20 national teams, featuring heavily in the 2010 UEFA Under-19 Championship elite qualification round.

He was part of the Spanish squad which was eliminated from its group at the 2012 Olympics, coming on as a substitute in their first match and starting the last.

In March 2019, Romeu was called up by Catalonia for a friendly against Venezuela.

He was voted as the SFWA Young Player of the Year in 2013 and has been named in the PFA Scotland Team of the Year for the Scottish Premiership three times. He was also nominated twice for the PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year.

Born in Inverness, Armstrong attended Hazlehead Academy in Aberdeen, alongside fellow footballer Fraser Fyvie. Armstrong grew up idolizing Gianfranco Zola.

Armstrong played for Dyce Boys Club and the Inverness Caledonian Thistle youth team, before signing professionally with Dundee United in July 2009.

Armstrong made his first team debut for Dundee United in November 2010, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Hamilton Academical. Two months later, on 12 January 2011, he provided his first assist, crossing for David Goodwillie to score as his side won 2–0 against Motherwell. Throughout the rest of the season, Armstrong was in and out of the team, making twelve appearance. Manager Peter Houston praised Armstrong on his substitute role.

The next season, Armstrong swapped between starting and coming off the bench as an impact sub. In a match against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, on 10 December 2011, he provided a double assist, in the second-half, to make a comeback win, which his side won 3–2. Armstrong then scored his first goal for United in a 2–2 draw against St Mirren in December 2011. After the match, Armstrong says scoring his first goal was his first proper strike, having scored but it was deflected against Inverness.

The next season, Armstrong made his European debut in the Europa League third qualifying round, second leg, which ended in a 5–0 loss against Russian side Dynamo Moscow. After making six appearance this season, Armstrong agreed a three-year contract with Dundee United in September 2012. Armstrong signed a new contract with United in October 2012. Armstrong scored his first goal of the season on 24 November, in a 2–1 win over Ross County. In mid-December, Armstong provided two assists in consecutive matches against Dundee and Inverness. Having made six appearances in February, Armstrong was awarded Clydesdale Bank Premier League Young Player of the Month. Armstrong was nominated for SPFA young player of the year, but it was awarded to Hibernian's Leigh Griffiths. He did, however, go on to win the SFWA Young Player of the Year award.

In the 2013–14 season, Armstrong started his season well, scoring goals against Hibernian and St Johnstone. Armstrong and Dundee United began negotiations over a new contract and on 12 December, he signed a one-year contract extension. Armstrong expressed an ambition to play in England in the future, but said he was happy to wait until he had established himself in the first team. In the January 2014 transfer window, the "Daily Mail" reported that Celtic were considering making a move for Armstrong, and that they were also interested in some of the club's other youngsters. This was later dismissed as "speculation" by Celtic manager Neil Lennon. In April 2014, he was nominated for the 2013–14 PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year award. He was also selected to the 2013–14 Premiership PFA Scotland Team of the Year.

Armstrong scored once and claimed two assists in November 2014 in wins over Kilmarnock and Motherwell. Armstrong scored twice more in league victories in December 2014 against Ross County and Celtic. He also registered assists in back-to-back matches in December 2014, in the defeat of Celtic and then the league defeat to St Johnstone In January 2015, Armstrong claimed a further two league goals and three assists in victories against Dundee and Hamilton Accies and another league goal in a draw with St Mirren. His last match for Dundee United came in a New Firm derby defeat of Aberdeen in a 2014–15 Scottish League Cup semi-final on 31 January 2015. Armstrong made 150 appearances, starting 109 matches, and scored 22 goals in all competitions for Dundee United before joining Celtic.

In January 2015, Dundee United turned down two transfer offers from Celtic for Armstrong, however the transfer was completed on 2 February 2015, alongside fellow Dundee United player Gary Mackay-Steven. Armstrong denied requesting the transfer. Both players would be ineligible for the remaining Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup ties as Celtic chased a domestic treble. Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were later given the nickname Zig and Zag by the staff at Celtic.

Armstrong scored on his Celtic debut in a 3–0 league victory at Partick Thistle on 11 February 2015. He gave Celtic a 2–0 lead after fellow debutante Gary Mackay-Steven opened the scoring. Armstrong made his Celtic Park and European debut in a 3–3 draw with Inter Milan in the UEFA Europa League on 19 February 2015.

Armstrong made his first appearance of the 2015–16 season, in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round first leg tie against Stjarnan, assisting the second goal in a 2–0 home win. He scored his first goals of the season with a second-half brace, in a 4–2 league win against Inverness CT on 15 August. He claimed assists in back-to-back matches in January, in wins against Dundee United and Hamilton, the latter result was an 8–1 home victory, the biggest recorded league win since the formation of the Scottish Premiership in 2013. His next goal came in a 3–1 league defeat of St Johnstone four days later.

Armstrong enjoyed a productive 2016–17 season, scoring 17 goals in all competitions as Celtic won a domestic treble.

Celtic won a second successive domestic treble in 2017–18, but Armstrong's season was interrupted by injuries. In June 2018, Celtic agreed a £7 million transfer fee for Armstrong with Premier League club Southampton.

Armstrong signed a four-year contract with Southampton in June 2018. He said he wanted to "hit the ground running" at the club. In November 2018 he stated that he did not miss Scottish football.

Armstrong represented Scotland at under-19 and under-21 levels. On 21 May 2013, Armstrong was called up for the senior team, along with his Dundee United teammate Gary Mackay-Steven. He was called up again by the national team in August 2015, and again in March 2017. Armstrong made his full international debut on 26 March 2017, in a 1–0 win against Slovenia. National team manager Gordon Strachan called it "the best Scotland debut I have ever seen." In September 2017 he was ruled out of two 2018 World Cup qualifying games through injury.

In 2014, Armstrong was studying for a law degree through the Open University in his spare time.

Mario Lemina

Mario René Junior Lemina (; born 1 September 1993) is a Gabonese professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for English club Southampton and the Gabon national team. He played for French sides Lorient and Marseille, before joining Italian side Juventus in 2015, where he won the domestic double in both of his seasons with the club.

Lemina began his career in France with the Lorient youth academy at the age of 11; he was later promoted to the first team during the 2012–13 season, his only season with the club.

The following season, Marseille acquired Lemina for €4 million, although he initially struggled to gain playing time in his first year with the club, making only eight league starts during the 2013–14 season. He began to be used more frequently by manager Marcelo Bielsa during the 2014–15 season, making his breakthrough with the club, as he helped the team to a fourth-place finish, earning 23 appearances in the league. In February 2015, Lemina was sent off for a punch to the groin of Ola Toivonen in a 1–1 Ligue 1 away draw against Rennes.

During the summer of 2015, Lemina began to attract the attention of several clubs, including Premier League clubs Liverpool, Southampton and West Ham United. On 31 August, however, the last day of the transfer window, Juventus announced the signing of Lemina on a season-long loan for €500,000 with an option to buy for €9.5 million at the end of the 2015–16 season. On 26 September 2015, he scored his first goal for Juventus in his third appearance, coming in the 63rd minute of a 2–1 away loss to Napoli.

On 29 April 2016, Lemina's loan was made permanent; he signed a four-year deal from Marseille for a fee of €9.5 million plus an extra €1 million if performance related targets are met. The deal was scheduled to keep him at Juventus until 2020. On 21 May, Lemina started in the Coppa Italia Final, playing the full match as Juventus defeated A.C. Milan 1–0 after extra time to capture the domestic double for the second consecutive season.

On 8 August 2017, Lemina joined Southampton on a five-year deal for a club record fee of £15.4m. He made his debut on 20 August, in a 3–2 victory over West Ham United. His first goal for Southampton came in a 3–2 victory over fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion on 3 February.

Lemina had been called by the Gabon national team to participate in the 2015 African Cup of Nations, but he refused his call-up. Although he had initially represented France's under-20 and under-21 sides, also winning the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup at youth level, he formally switched to the Gabonese Federation on 2 June, and is now a formal member of the Gabon national team. He scored on his international debut, in a 3–3 friendly draw against Tunisia on 9 October 2015.

A strong, hard-working, and dynamic right-footed midfielder, with good technique and solid distribution, Lemina is a box-to-box player who is usually deployed in the centre, due to his ability to start attacking plays after winning back possession. Due to his tactical versatility, he is capable of playing in several positions, and has been deployed as a winger, as a full-back, or as a wing-back, on the right flank; during his time with Marseille, he also played as centre-back in a three-man defence on occasion, during the 2014–15 season, under manager Marcelo Bielsa. Despite his talent, he has also earned a reputation for having a temper and for lacking concentration at times.

Ryan Bertrand

Ryan Dominic Bertrand (born 5 August 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back for club Southampton and the English national team.

Born in Southwark, London, Bertrand began his youth career at Gillingham, before signing for Chelsea in July 2005. He graduated from Chelsea's youth system and was sent on loan to various clubs between 2006 and 2010. He made his full debut for Chelsea on 20 April 2011, six years after joining them, in a fixture against Birmingham City. In the 2011–12 season, Bertrand signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea and was made understudy to Ashley Cole, whom he described a "fantastic role model." On 19 May 2012, Bertrand became the first player to make his Champions League debut in the final, starting in an unfamiliar left wing role in front of Cole; Chelsea beat Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties. He has honours with Chelsea, including an FA Cup and UEFA Champions League titles.

Bertrand is an England international, having also represented 'the Young Lions' at under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20, under-21 levels, as well as Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics. On 15 August 2012, he made his debut for the England senior team, in a friendly against Italy, in a 2–1 win.

Bertrand was born in Southwark, London. He joined Gillingham aged nine, progressing through their youth system. Bertrand attended the Robert Napier School in Gillingham, Kent.

Bertrand is a founder of the Fin-tech brokerage Silicon Markets which provides machine learning and algorithmic trading tools for retail traders in the Foreign Exchange and CFD markets.

Bertrand was signed by Chelsea in July 2005 from Gillingham for an initial £125,000, which was set by a tribunal and is subject to increase depending on progress.

During the 2006–07 season, he was twice sent on loan to AFC Bournemouth, at the same time as Chelsea teammate Jack Cork. He suffered a ruptured spleen in a youth team match against Arsenal that ruled him out of the later part of that season.

In August 2007, Bertrand joined Oldham Athletic on loan until January 2008.

On 4 January 2008, a matter of days after his spell at Oldham came to an end, Bertrand joined Norwich City on loan for the rest of the 2007–08 season. He put in a number of impressive displays playing at both left full back and on the left wing, and admitted he would welcome a longer stay with the club. Bertrand became popular with the Carrow Road crowd earning him the nickname 'Plastic' in reference to the Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand. On 4 July 2008, he rejoined the club on loan until January 2009, with an option to extend to the end of the season. 

On 17 July 2009, Bertrand joined Reading on a season-long loan. He scored his first professional goal against Derby County on 10 March 2010. He came third in the voting for Reading's player of the season, behind Gylfi Sigurðsson and Jimmy Kébé.

On 5 August 2010, Bertrand signed on loan with Championship club Nottingham Forest in an initial six-month deal. He made his debut for "Forest" as a substitute in a 1–0 away defeat against Burnley. He was a regular for "Forest" for whom he made a total of 19 appearances. "Forest" were interested in either extending Bertrand's loan spell for the rest of the season or to sign him permanently but when his loan period expired on 3 January 2011 he returned to his parent club Chelsea.

Bertrand made his Premier League debut on 20 April 2011, when he came on as substitute to replace Ashley Cole in a 3–1 win against Birmingham City. Bertrand also made a goal, providing a cross which Florent Malouda headed past Birmingham goalkeeper Ben Foster.

On 15 July 2011, Bertrand signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea.

He was used as a back-up to Cole by then Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, as he remained with Chelsea and left back Patrick van Aanholt went out on loan. Six years after signing for Chelsea as a school-boy, Bertrand made his first starting appearance against Fulham in the League Cup. The match finished in favour of Chelsea, who won on penalties 4–3, as the match ended goalless.

During the 2011–12 season, Bertrand played 90 minutes in Chelsea's 2–0 defeat against Liverpool in the League Cup. He made his first league appearance of the season coming on as a late substitute for Ashley Cole against Everton, the match ended in a 2–0 defeat for Chelsea. Bertrand was handed his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic on 7 April, in which he produced an outstanding performance, as Chelsea won 2–1 and he was named fan's man of the match. He was again named man of the match in his third start, a 0–0 draw with Arsenal on 21 April. On 5 May, Bertrand won the FA Cup with Chelsea, but he did not appear on the pitch in the win against Liverpool.

Bertrand made his European debut in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich on 19 May 2012, playing on the left of midfield, becoming the first player in the Champions League era to make his debut in the final. He was substituted with a knock after 70 minutes and replaced by Florent Malouda as Chelsea edged out Bayern 4–3 on penalties.

Bertrand scored his first professional goal for Chelsea in the Community Shield match against Manchester City on 12 August 2012, which they went on to lose 3–2. He started in the first league match of the season against Wigan Athletic playing as a winger. On 5 September 2012, Bertrand signed a new improved five-year contract with Chelsea. On 25 September, he scored his second professional goal in a League Cup match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge, which Chelsea won 6–0.

On 1 April 2013, he came on as a replacement for Ashley Cole in the FA Cup quarter-final replay against Manchester United, which Chelsea went on to win 1–0. It was revealed after the match that Cole would be sidelined for at least two weeks, leaving Bertrand as the clubs only recognised left back. He started the next match, the Europa League quarter-final first leg against Rubin Kazan at Stamford Bridge, putting in a strong performance as Chelsea ran out 3–1 winners. On 7 April, Bertrand made his 50th Chelsea appearance in a 2–1 win against Sunderland.

He started at left back in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium on 14 April, which ended in a 2–1 defeat for Chelsea. In the continued absence of Ashley Cole, Bertrand started and performed well in the next league match in the West London derby against Fulham at Craven Cottage on 17 April, which Chelsea comfortably won 3–0 thanks to a 30-yard strike from David Luiz and a brace from John Terry.

On 17 January 2014, Bertrand joined Aston Villa on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut the next day in a 2–2 draw with Liverpool.

On 30 July 2014, Bertrand joined Southampton on loan for the 2014–15 season. He made his competitive debut for the club on 17 August in their first match of the league season, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–1 defeat away to Liverpool. Bertrand scored for Southampton the first time on 27 September, opening a 2–1 home win against Queens Park Rangers. His second goal for the club came on 26 December, in a 3–1 victory over Crystal Palace. On 1 February 2015, he was given a straight red card at the end of a 0–1 home loss against Swansea City for a foul on Modou Barrow.

On 2 February 2015, Bertrand completed a permanent move to Southampton, signing a 4½-year deal for an undisclosed fee, estimated to be £10 million. On 26 April, he was the only Southampton player named in the PFA Team of the Year.

Bertrand scored his only goal of the 2015–16 season in the final match, a penalty in a 4–1 win over Crystal Palace. On 12 July 2016, Bertrand signed a new five-year contract.

Bertrand has represented England youth teams at under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels. 

He was part of the U19 squad at the 2008 European Championship. 

He was promoted to the U21s and called up for several 2009 European Championship qualifiers, but missed out of the squad for the final tournament. On 14 November, Stuart Pearce selected him at left back for an under-21 match against Portugal at Wembley in Group 9 of the qualification process, and helped the team keep first clean sheet since 29 June 2009. He was named in the England under-21 squad for the 2011 European Championship and played all matches.

On 2 July 2012, Bertrand was named in Stuart Pearce's 18-man squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He played his first match for Great Britain on 20 July 2012 in a friendly match against Brazil. He played three matches during the Olympic tournament.

On 10 August 2012, Bertrand was called up to the senior England team for the first time, for a friendly match against Italy. He made his international debut coming on for Leighton Baines in the 78th minute and cleared a shot off the line minutes later from Manolo Gabbiadini which eventually led to England's winning goal as England won the match 2–1. 

On 11 September 2012, Bertrand came on after 73 minutes in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Ukraine and crossed the ball that led to the penalty that Frank Lampard converted. On 8 October 2012, Bertrand was called up to the England squad for two more qualifying matches, against San Marino and Poland. However he missed both matches because of a virus.

Bertrand came on as a substitute for England away to Italy on 3 March 2015 and he won his fourth full cap, starting for England against Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 7 June 2015. 

Bertrand was part of the squad for UEFA Euro 2016. On 1 September 2017, Bertrand scored his first goal for England in a 4–0 World Cup qualifier win over Malta.

Bertrand has been described as a modern-day full-back who gives assistance in attacking down the flanks, keeping and retaining possession as well as defending and reclaiming possession, making quick runs into the box and often does one-two's with his teammates. Bertrand was described by Glenn Roeder, his manager at Norwich, as a defender who "likes to bomb forward and is tenacious in the tackle when defending." In a 2018 "ESPN FC" article about the state of left-backs in England, Michael Cox said that the "only real star is Ryan Bertrand, a truly excellent full-back defensively and offensively".

Nathan Redmond

Nathan Daniel Jerome Redmond (born 6 March 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays for club Southampton and the English national team.

Redmond began his career as a youngster with Birmingham City, his hometown club. He made his first-team debut in the League Cup second-round tie against Rochdale in August 2010, becoming the club's second-youngest player ever at the age of 16 years and 173 days. After representing England at levels up to under-19, Redmond made his first under-21 debut in the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals. He joined Premier League club Norwich City in the 2013 close season, before making the switch to Southampton from Norwich in the 2016 close season.

He typically plays as a wide midfielder. He is right-footed, but has regularly played on both right and left wings, often cutting inside. He has also occasionally played in the centre behind a lone striker.

Redmond was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, of Irish and Jamaican descent. He grew up in the Kitts Green district, attending the Oval Primary School in Yardley and then Sheldon Heath Community Arts College. According to the player's "Facebook" page, he was first noticed by Birmingham City's Academy scouts as an eight-year-old while playing alongside older boys, and scored a hat-trick in his first match for the club's under-10 team.

He scored three goals as Birmingham's under-15 team reached the semi-final of the Nike Premier Cup for the first time in April 2009, and in the same season played in the club's under-18 academy team.

In the 2009–10 season, while still a schoolboy, Redmond made 15 appearances, scoring 3 times, for the academy under-18s. He also made a few substitute appearances for the reserve team, including a "lively late performance" against Aston Villa in early March 2010. Redmond was given a first-team squad number and named on standby for the Premier League match at home to Everton a couple of days later, but did not make the 18-man squad. He was an unused substitute for Birmingham's final home match of the 2009–10 season, aged 16 years and 56 days. Had he taken the field, he would have become the club's youngest first-team player and also the youngest ever Premier League player, at nine days younger than the record set by Fulham's Matthew Briggs in 2007.

Academy manager Terry Westley described him in June 2010 as "one of those wingers like an Aaron Lennon or Ashley Young. He has got pace and can run the ball past defenders and has the creativity to go with it", and confirmed that other clubs had shown an interest in him. He signed a scholarship contract with Birmingham City in July 2010.

Redmond made his first-team debut for Birmingham in the League Cup second-round tie against Rochdale on 26 August 2010, replacing Spanish midfielder Enric Vallès in the 78th minute. At 16 years and 173 days34 days older than Trevor Francis was on his debuthe became the club's second-youngest player ever. Manager Alex McLeish was highly complimentary about his brief appearance:

To gain first-team experience, Redmond joined League Two club Burton Albion in January 2011 on a month's Football League youth loan, an arrangement which allows the player to appear in junior matches for Birmingham when not required by the loaning club. However the move was cancelled a few days later when the Football League, who had initially ratified the deal, realised that the rules forbade a first-year scholar from signing on loan for a League club. He made two more substitute appearances for Birmingham that season, one in the League Cup and one in the FA Cup, and signed a three-year professional contract as soon as he turned 17, in March 2011.

On his return from the U-17 World Cup, Redmond started Birmingham's first pre-season friendly match, a 1–0 defeat of Cork City. New manager Chris Hughton suggested he had done well, given his youth: "In particular I thought Nathan Redmond did very well. We have to remember he's only 17 years of age. He showed some good touches although the final bit let him down a little." In the absence of fellow midfielders Keith Fahey, Morgaro Gomis and Jordon Mutch, Redmond played the whole of the Europa League play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional, the first time he had completed 90 minutes in a senior match and the first time his club had participated in major European competition for nearly 50 years. His driven shot from outside the penalty area was pushed aside by goalkeeper Elisson and led to Chris Wood heading against the crossbar. He made his League debut three days later, again playing the whole match, in a 3–1 defeat at Middlesbrough. In the second leg against Nacional, Redmond opened the scoring with a low drive from , which was in contention for the club's goal of the season, and later hit the post with a curled shot in a man-of-the-match performance as Birmingham won 3–0 to progress to the group stage.

Redmond's first league goal came in a 3–0 win at home to Blackpool on 31 December 2011 as he "smashed an unstoppable shot from just outside the penalty area that beat Howard at his near post". His second, "thumped in ... from 12 yards in stoppage time" completed a 6–0 win away against a nine-man Millwall team. Redmond opened the scoring with a shot from the edge of the penalty area as Birmingham went on to beat Sheffield United 4–0 to progress to the fifth round of the 2011–12 FA Cup, and came off the bench to score a "stunning" 86th-minute swivelled volley to give Birmingham a 1–0 win against Portsmouth that took them to third place in the table. He finished the season with seven goals from 37 appearances in all competitions, and won the club's Young Player of the Year award.

Ahead of the new season, the club's acting chairman insisted that, despite financial problems, neither Redmond nor goalkeeper Jack Butland were for sale "unless we are subject to an eye-popping offer". Redmond aimed to establish himself as a first-team regular. He made his 50th senior appearance in the 1–0 win at Brighton & Hove Albion in October, but soon afterwards, Birmingham signed West Ham United winger Robert Hall on loan, and Redmond was sometimes left out of the squad. According to new manager Lee Clark, Redmond "needed to be taken out of the firing line and would be better for it"; he made comparisons with loanee Ravel Morrison, who had been encouraged to understand the importance of "the whole package, getting it right – the training, the preparation, the matches, getting that all put in place". After talking to his manager, Redmond accepted the need to improve his performance in training.

Against Burnley in December, in what was reportedly the youngest starting eleven ever fielded by the club, Redmond played as a second striker off Nikola Žigić, a position that exploited his pace and preference for receiving the ball to his feet. As the season went on, Redmond's form improved: he created a goal for Chris Burke against Nottingham Forest, and when his first goal of the season finally arrived, against Derby County in March, Clark suggested it boded well for his future as a goalscorer. The player spoke of himself as a "confidence player", who needed to accept the need for patience and not to let frustration get the better of him. According to the "Birmingham Mail"'s end-of-season assessment, "Redmond's form over the last three months was as good as it ever has been." That form earned him selection for the England under-20 squad for the Under-20 World Cup, then as a late addition to the squad for the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals.

The sale of Butland to Stoke City in January meant that no other players needed to leave in that transfer window, and Clark made it clear towards the end of the season that it would be a foolish move to cash in on Redmond in the close season. However, at the start of the 2013 summer transfer window, Birmingham accepted bids from Premier League clubs Swansea City and Norwich City, reportedly an initial £2 million plus up to £1.2 million in additional payments. Redmond chose to rejoin Chris Hughton at Norwich, where he signed a four-year contract.

He made his debut for Norwich in a 2–2 draw with Everton on 17 August 2013, and scored his first goal two weeks later against Southampton; playing on the left wing – not his natural side – he "cut inside and lashed home low from the edge of the box" to secure Norwich's first league win of the season.

On 25 June 2016, Redmond completed a move to Premier League club Southampton for an undisclosed fee, believed by BBC Sport to be £10 million. He signed a five-year contract. Redmond scored on his competitive debut, with the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Watford on 13 August.

Redmond first played for the England under-16 team on 15 October 2009. He was involved in the build-up for the only goal of the match, as England under-16 beat their Wales counterparts in their opening match of the 2009 Victory Shield, a tournament which they went on to win. In 2010, he played in all four matches, and scored his first international goal, as the under-16s reached the final of the Montaigu Tournament.

He made his debut for England under-17s on 3 August 2010 in the Nordic Tournament in a 5–0 win against Finland under-17s, and scored the opening goal against Denmark under-17s, as England went on to defeat Sweden under-17s in the final. Redmond was part of the England under-17 squad that qualified for the 2011 European under-17 championships. Needing to beat Spain to finish top of their elite round group, Redmond opened the scoring from a Raheem Sterling cross as England went on to win 2–1. In the final stages, he started the first two group matches, a draw with France and a defeat against Denmark, and was a substitute in the remaining group match, a 3–0 victory against Serbia which took England through to the semi-final and confirmed their qualification for the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Redmond was a second-half substitute in the semi-final match, which England lost to the Netherlands.

Together with many of his under-17 teammates, Redmond moved up to the England under-18s, a non-competitive age group at international level, in 2011. He made a positive debut in a 1–1 draw away to Slovakia in November. Brought into the under-19s squad to replace the injured Larnell Cole, Redmond made his first appearance at that level in February 2012, as a 57th-minute substitute for Saido Berahino in a 2–1 defeat of the Czech Republic. He was part of the squad for the 2012 European under-19 championships, and scored the winning goal against Serbia in the group stage that confirmed England's progression to the semi-final and qualification for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Under-20 manager Peter Taylor confirmed in a radio interview that Redmond, whom he described as "a clever winger [who] can play as a number 10, as they call it, also" and who had "had an outstanding season", would be in his squad for the Under-20 World Cup. A few days later, he was called into the under-21 squad for the 2013 European Under-21 Championship finals, as a late replacement for Andros Townsend. With Tom Ince suspended and Wilfried Zaha injured, Redmond started England's opening match of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat to Italy. Captain Jordan Henderson, manager Stuart Pearce, pundits and press picked out Redmond for praise in a generally poor team performance. He kept his place for the second group match, against Norway, as part of a three-man attack alongside the returning Ince and Zaha. The "Independent"'s Steve Tongue described him as "one of the few who offered any promise, until he was replaced" by Jonjo Shelvey, but a 3–1 defeat confirmed England's elimination.

Redmond scored the first goal and was named the sponsors' man of the match as England under-21s, under senior team manager Roy Hodgson, beat Scotland 6–0 in August 2013. His hat-trick against Wales U21 in May 2014 gave England a 3–1 win that opened up a nine-point lead in their qualifying group for the 2015 European Championships.

Redmond was chosen England Under-21 Player of the Year for 2016, with 32% of the vote, ahead of Southampton teammate James Ward-Prowse with 25%.

On 16 March 2017, he was named in the senior England squad that was to play a friendly against Germany and a World Cup qualifying match against Lithuania. He went on to make his full England debut in the Germany match, coming on as a 66th-minute substitute for Adam Lallana.

Angus Gunn

Angus Fraser James Gunn (born 22 January 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Southampton. He has represented England at under-21 level. He began his career at his hometown club Norwich City, before joining Manchester City in 2011, eventually signing his first professional contract in 2013.

After spending the 2017–18 season on loan at boyhood club Norwich, enjoying a good run of performances throughout the entire Championship campaign, Gunn signed for Southampton in the summer of 2018, for a transfer fee of £13.5 million.

Gunn was born in Norwich, Norfolk, to Norwich City's former goalkeeper and manager Bryan and 
artist Susan Gunn. His father is originally from Caithness in the far north of Scotland.

Gunn began his career at his hometown club Norwich City, before moving to Manchester City in 2011, for which a tribunal decided Manchester City had to pay £250,000. He signed a three-year professional contract in June 2013. He was named on the substitutes bench on a number of occasions throughout the 2016–17 season, but did not play for Manchester City that season.

For the 2017–18 season, Gunn was loaned back to Norwich City. He made his first-team debut in Norwich's first match of the season, away to Fulham. He got his first professional football clean sheet on 16 August 2017, in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road. He would ultimately be the only player to be ever present for Norwich in the league during the season, also being ever present in the FA Cup and making three appearances in the Carabao Cup. At the end of the season, Norwich fans voted him third in the Player of the Season vote behind James Maddison and Grant Hanley.

Gunn joined Southampton in July 2018, signing a five-year deal with the club, for a fee estimated at £13.5 million. He made his debut appearance for the club on 28 August 2018 in a Carabao Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion. He made his Premier League debut on 2 January 2019, making several vital saves and keeping a clean sheet and earning the man of the match award in a 0–0 draw against Chelsea.

Despite his father Bryan representing Scotland at international level, Angus has represented the country of his birth England at various youth levels. 

Gunn received his first call up to the England national team in November 2017 for a friendly match against Brazil, after Jack Butland withdrew from the squad with an injury. In March 2018, Gunn was offered the opportunity by Scotland manager Alex McLeish to switch allegiances to Scotland, but decided to stay with England national team, and was called up to England’s pre 2018 World Cup training camp in May 2018 by Gareth Southgate.

Josh Sims

Joshua S. Sims (born July 29, 1978) is an American former professional lacrosse player. He played in Major League Lacrosse through 2013 and last played box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League with the Philadelphia Wings in 2010.

Sims was a member of the Under-19 Team USA that won the World Championship in Tokyo in 1996.

After graduating from Severn, Sims attended Princeton University. He was the first Princeton Student-Athlete to be presented with the NCAA Top VIII Award (the first lacrosse player to be presented with the award since 1983). He was only the fourth Ivy League athlete honored in the award's 27-year history. He was awarded the 1998 & 2000 McLaughlin Award as the best NCAA lacrosse midfielder. He was a first team USILA All-American Team selection in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He was also first team All-Ivy League in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Sims earned the 2000 Men's Ivy League Player of the Year.

Two of these undefeated league champions won the 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships, becoming the first team to threepeat since Syracuse from 1988–90 and the first to be recognized to have done so without an NCAA scandal since Johns Hopkins from 1978–80. The 1999 and 2000 teams also earned NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship invitations, bringing the schools streak to eleven consecutive seasons.

In Sims' first game as a Tiger, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1997 overtime 7–6 victory over Johns Hopkins. Ten years later, ESPN described the goal as a "leaping, behind-the-back" shot, while the "Baltimore Sun" described the shot by saying that ". . .Sims flicked in a rebound shot blindly behind his back." He was recognized twice in 1997 as Ivy League Rookie of the Week. During the 1998 season, Sims became a scoring threat from midfield as most defenses focused on the All-American trio of Princeton attackmen (Jesse Hubbard, Chris Massey and Jon Hess). In the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, Sims scored a game-high four goals in the quarterfinal 11–9 victory over Duke and a team-high three goals, including the game-winning goal in the semifinal 11–10 victory against Syracuse. For his efforts, he was named to the All-tournament team. In 1999, he scored a quadruple overtime game-winning goal helping Princeton secure it invitation to the 1999 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament with its seventh consecutive victory. In the 2000 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament, he posted two goals and two assists in the 10–7 quarterfinal victory over Maryland. He also scored in the 12–11 semifinal victory against Virginia. Sims' two goals made him the only person to score multiple goals for Princeton in the championship game 13–7 loss to Syracuse.

Fraser Forster

Fraser Gerard Forster (born 17 March 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Southampton and the English national team.

Forster started his career with Newcastle United and had brief loan spells with Stockport County and Bristol Rovers. He then spent a successful season on loan at Norwich City, helping the club win the League One title and promotion to the Championship. Forster then joined Celtic on loan for the 2010–11 season, and helped them win the Scottish Cup. He spent a further season on loan there, winning the Scottish Premier League before becoming a permanent squad member in 2012 for a transfer fee of £2.2 million. Forster won many plaudits for his performances at Celtic and holds the Scottish top division record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal. In August 2014, he joined Southampton for a reported £10 million. Forster had a generally impressive debut season in the Premier League, but sustained a serious knee injury in March 2015 which ruled him out for the rest of the year. On his return in January 2016, he quickly found form again and went on to set a club record of 708 minutes without conceding a goal. Forster's return aided Southampton's rise from thirteenth in the league to a sixth-place finish, earning them qualification for the following season's UEFA Europa League.

Forster was selected for several England squads during 2012 and 2013 before finally making his first international appearance in November 2013. He was named in England's squads for the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016.

Forster was born in Hexham, Northumberland, the son of Brian Clive Forster QC (who later became a circuit judge), and attended the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, but did not begin playing as a goalkeeper until he was 13 years old. Before then he had mainly played either rugby union or cricket. Coaches initially thought Forster might be too small to play as a goalkeeper, although he played for local junior team Stocksfield before joining the renowned Wallsend Boys Club. However, he entered a significant growth spurt at 15 years of age and later signed with Newcastle United.

Forster earned his first professional contract with Newcastle United, signing for their Academy in 2005. Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played regularly in the reserves. However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly due to the fact that he spent most of his time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.

With Krul back for the 2008–09 season and Given back to full fitness, it was the turn of Forster to go on loan. He was loaned out to Stockport County on 2 October 2008, to deputise for regular goalkeeper Owain Fôn Williams while he was away on international duty with Wales. Forster started his first match for Stockport on 7 October in the Football League Trophy second round, where they lost 1–0 away to Bury. He started his first league match for Stockport on 11 October, where his team drew 1–1 away to Southend United. He returned to Newcastle on 1 November, after completing his loan stint at Stockport playing six league matches and keeping three clean sheets.

Forster, having been on the bench for Newcastle on over 20 occasions in the Premier League, needed regular playing experience and subsequently signed a month-loan deal with Bristol Rovers on 31 July 2009. He kept two clean sheets in the four league matches he played for them. Bristol Rovers asked to extend the loan but Norwich City made a counter offer which was accepted by Newcastle. Manager Paul Trollope was disappointed and commented that the team wanted Forster between the sticks. He stated "Fraser has a great career ahead of him".

Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was keen to sign Forster who he had seen play for both Stockport and Bristol Rovers. Forster then signed for Norwich City in a one-month loan deal. It was then extended to the end of January 2010 after making an impressive debut against Hartlepool in the 2–0 victory at Victoria Park. Forster received a red card on 26 September 2009 against Gillingham for bringing Curtis Weston down in the penalty area, however this was considered to be a controversial decision. He made a blunder in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United on 19 October, with a 90th-minute goal kick going straight to Jermaine Beckford who scored.

On 20 November 2009, Norwich announced that they had agreed a deal with Newcastle to extend Forster's loan until the end of the 2009–10 season, after impressing the Norwich faithful with his displays, helping the team shoot up the League One table. He was also allowed to play in Norwich City's cup matches. Norwich manager Paul Lambert praised "world class" saves and a terrific contribution to the team.

In November 2009, Forster was awarded Norwich City Player of the Month. On 17 April 2010, Norwich secured promotion to the Championship with a hard-fought 1–0 win over Charlton Athletic, with Forster pulling off excellent saves to deny Nicky Bailey and Deon Burton. One week later, Norwich's 2–0 win over Gillingham saw them win the League One title. In recognition of his contribution to Norwich's success, Forster was named the club's Players' Player of the Year 2010 and second in the Supporters' Player of the Year award. An excellent season at Norwich was completed by his award of the Macron Golden Gloves Award for the best record of clean sheets in the league, keeping 18 clean sheets in 38 league appearances and 20 clean sheets in 42 appearances in all competitions.

On 24 August 2010, Forster joined Celtic, originally on a season-long loan from Newcastle. Celtic manager Neil Lennon described Forster by saying, "He's a big boy, he's come highly recommended, his age is the only thing going against him because otherwise he's all the qualities you look for." He made his Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as Celtic won 1–0. He then went on to play in every match of Celtic's season with the exception of two cup matches.

Forster had a successful season with Celtic, winning a runner-up medal in the League Cup and Scottish Premier League. Between them, Forster and fellow goalkeeper Łukasz Załuska kept 23 clean sheets in the league, breaking Celtic's previous clean sheet record from the 2001–02 season. Forster kept 21 of the clean sheets. He capped off his season with a 3–0 victory over Motherwell to help Celtic win the Scottish Cup. In total, he kept 24 clean sheets in 44 matches for Celtic.

After appearing for Newcastle in pre-season against Darlington, Orlando City, Leeds United and Fiorentina, as well as being named among the substitutes for the opening match of the Premier League season against Arsenal, Forster rejoined Celtic, on loan for the remainder of the season, on 17 August 2011. He helped Celtic draw 0–0 against FC Sion at home, but then lost 3–1 in the away leg, only for UEFA to reinstate Celtic into the Europa League with 3–0 wins in both legs after Sion were found to be fielding ineligible players, thus allowing Forster to keep his only clean sheets in Europe for the season, as he conceded in all the five group matches he played in.

Forster had a successful 2011–12 season with Celtic, winning the Scottish Premier League and helping his team beat the previous season's record of 23 clean sheets. He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster racking up 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty in the final minute of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three important points for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.

On 29 June 2012, it was announced that Forster had signed for Celtic on a permanent deal for a fee in the region of £2 million. On signing the four-year deal, Forster stated, "I'm very happy that I'm going to be at Celtic for the next four years at least", and added that "The manager's faith in me means a lot, I've loved my two seasons at Celtic and he's done so much for my confidence." Manager Neil Lennon described Forster as being a "top class keeper" and that he considered him to be an important addition to the squad.

On 7 November 2012, Forster produced a resolute performance against Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League group stages, helping Celtic record a historic 2–1 win during the week of the club's 125th anniversary. Due to the calibre of his performance, the Spanish media nicknamed Forster "La Gran Muralla" ("The Great Wall"). Forster continued to impress in domestic matches as well. In January 2013, Motherwell were awarded a soft penalty against Celtic. Bizarrely, referee Steven McLean allowed Tom Hateley to take the penalty kick from "in front" of the penalty spot. Forster was yellow carded for his protests to McLean, but the goalkeeper went on to produce an excellent one-handed save high to his right. The following month in a league match against Dundee, Forster tipped over a powerful Gary Harkins dipping shot at full-stretch. This save was voted the SPL Save of the Season in May 2013. Forster went to win a second league title with Celtic that season, and completed a league and cup double on 26 May 2013 with a 3–0 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final.

Celtic again qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save near the end of the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when he seemed to be clean through on goal.

Forster's impressive performances for Celtic in the Champions League and involvement with the England international squad led to media reports in October and November 2013 that several clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, were considering to make a bid for the goalkeeper. In response to the press speculation, Celtic manager Neil Lennon commented, "It's going to be impossible to keep Fraser, the way he's playing," adding, "Inevitably, I think a huge club will come in and make a huge bid for him."

On 2 February 2014, Forster set a new a club-record of 11 league clean sheets in a row, surpassing a record of ten clean sheets set by Charlie Shaw in the 1921–22 season. Forster's achievement was noted abroad, with the Spanish daily sports newspaper "Marca" awarding him their weekly "El Óscar" accolade to someone in football who has made an outstanding contribution in some way to their team. On 22 February 2014, Forster broke Bobby Clark's Scottish League record of 1,155 minutes without conceding a goal in a league match. Celtic won 2–0 away at Hearts, and Forster racked up his 13th consecutive clean sheet in the league.
Forster's clean sheet run finally ended on 1,256 minutes against Aberdeen on 25 February 2014, with Jonny Hayes beating him from 30 yards to open the scoring in a 2–1 win for "The Dons". Forster finished the season with another league winner's medal as Celtic clinched their third consecutive Scottish League title, and his form over the year saw him voted into the PFA Scotland Team of the Year alongside teammates Virgil van Dijk and Kris Commons.

Amidst speculation linking him with a transfer to Southampton, Forster played in Celtic's first four matches in the qualifying rounds for the Champions League. Celtic lost 4–1 away at Legia Warsaw, with Forster saving a penalty kick from Ivica Vrdoljak. Celtic eventually won the tie on away goals, after being awarded a 3–0 win for the second leg at home due to Legia fielding an ineligible player in that match.

On 8 August 2014, Celtic and Southampton agreed a reported fee of around £10 million for the transfer of Forster to the Premier League club. Southampton officially announced the transfer the next day, after Forster signed a four-year contract with the club.

He made his Premier League debut on 17 August in Southampton's first match of the season, a 2–1 defeat away at Liverpool. One week later, Forster kept his first clean sheet for the club in a goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion at home. By mid-October, and after eight Premier League matches, Forster had kept four clean sheets and conceded only five goals, at that time the best defensive record in the Premier League.

Forster was at fault for Aston Villa's goal in a 1–1 draw in November; coming out of his penalty box in an attempt to intercept a long clearance but missing the ball and gifting Gabriel Agbonlahor a goal. However, he was defended by manager Ronald Koeman, who stated, "He [Forster] is a great goalkeeper and that doesn't change after this mistake." Another error by Forster a month later in the League Cup led to the only goal in a surprise 1–0 win for Sheffield United. Those two mistakes, however, proved to be exceptions, as Forster's form generally continued to be very impressive. By 7 February 2015, another clean sheet in a 1–0 win away at Queens Park Rangers saw Southampton move up to third place in the League. Fraser again gained plaudits, this time for pulling off a reflex save to tip a Charlie Austin downward header over the crossbar. The match was his 11th clean sheet in the Premier League, the best record among top-flight goalkeepers over the course of the season at that point.

On 21 March 2015, in a match against Burnley, Forster suffered a severe knee injury after clearing a back pass and was escorted off the pitch by medics, and replaced by Kelvin Davis. Koeman said Forster's injury was "looking bad" and that the doctors were "not positive". Up to this point, he had been ever-present for Southampton throughout the season and kept the most clean sheets in the League. Four days later, Southampton confirmed Forster's injury to be a broken kneecap and that he would be out for the remainder of the season.

Although initially expected to be out for up to a year, Forster resumed light training in November 2015. Manager Ronald Koeman commented, "Everybody [at Southampton] is happy with how he is and that he's recovering well." On 6 January 2016, Forster played the full 90 minutes of an Under-21 Premier League Cup match against Chelsea, keeping a clean-sheet. He made his Premier League return on 13 January 2016, playing the full 90 minutes and keeping a clean sheet in Southampton's 2–0 win over Watford. Forster went on to keep clean sheets in his next two appearances, although he had little to do in any of his three matches since returning from injury.

Forster's performance at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 in his fourth match was highly impressive and drew plaudits from many. "The Gunners" dominated the match, and had 11 shots on target as opposed to Southampton's three. Forster pulled off a string of saves in what "The Daily Telegraph" described as a "genuinely inspired goalkeeping performance". He saved twice from Mesut Özil in the first half, saving his first effort at goal with an outstretched leg then parrying his second shot, a volley from close range, away to safety. In the second half a shot from Alexis Sánchez was saved so spectacularly that Arsenal's Olivier Giroud was seen to turn towards Forster and applaud the save. A double save near the end of the match from Theo Walcott helped Southampton secure a hard-fought 0–0 draw. After the match, Koeman praised his goalkeeper, hailing his performance as "magic" and describing him as "one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League and maybe in Europe". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger also acknowledged Forster's showing, saying, "He had a brilliant game." Former Arsenal goalkeeper, Bob Wilson, added further praise: "It was an exceptional goalkeeping display," adding, "Where I am admiring Fraser most is he has come back so well from a real long lay-off from a career-threatening injury... As regards who won Southampton the point it was Fraser without any doubt."

On 13 February, Forster recorded his sixth consecutive clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Swansea City, a run which helped Southampton rise from 13th to 6th place in the Premier League since his return from injury. His clean sheet run lasted a club record 708 minutes until he was beaten by Cesc Fàbregas in a 1–2 home loss to Chelsea on 27 February. Forster's form since his return from injury, and run of clean sheets, saw him win the Premier League Player of the Month award for February. On 13 May, he signed a new contract until 2021. Southampton's 4–1 win over Crystal Palace on 15 May in their final league match of the season saw them finish in sixth place on 63 points, securing entry into the following season's Europa League and their highest ever points tally in the Premier League.

Although first choice goalkeeper since his arrival at Southampton, it was only after the retirement of Kelvin Davis in the summer of 2016 that Forster was finally handed the traditional goalkeeper's "number 1" shirt at the club. Southampton made a poor start to the season under new manager Claude Puel, taking only one point in their first three league matches, but from mid-September onwards Forster went on a run of five successive clean sheets in all competitions. This run of clean sheets helped Southampton rise up to eighth in the league. However, both Forster and his team endured a slump in form thereafter. A mis-kick by the goalkeeper against Crystal Palace on 3 December gifted Christian Benteke an easy opportunity to open the scoring in a 3–0 win over Southampton. Southampton suffered an equally heavy defeat on 29 December against Tottenham Hotspur, losing 4–1 in match where ESPN described Forster's distribution as "nothing short of appalling" and held him culpable for at least two of the goals conceded. Forster's poor form continued into January 2017, where it was noted his save/shot ratio was the worst amongst Premier League goalkeepers for the season to date.

Despite indifferent form on the part of both Forster and Southampton as a whole, Southampton became the first team in history to reach the League Cup final without conceding a single goal. However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had a good match in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th-minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.

Although he had an inconsistent year, Forster did end the season with a total of 14 clean sheets, although his side only finished eighth in the league and failed to qualify for European football in the following season.

On 19 July 2017, Forster signed a new five-year contract, and described Southampton as being "a fantastic club to be at". His indifferent form, however, continued into the new season, with mistakes against Manchester United, Newcastle and Brighton all resulting in Southampton dropping points during the early months in the league. Despite these errors, manager Mauricio Pellegrino defended Forster, insisting he is a "really good goalkeeper" and that "the position of the goalkeeper is always exposed in this type of situation but nobody remembers the good situations." Forster was eventually dropped from the team in December 2017, replaced in goal by Alex McCarthy. He has not played for Southampton since.

By July 2018, Forster was pushed further down the pecking order at Southampton with the arrival at the club of Angus Gunn from Manchester City as back-up for Alex McCarthy.

On 4 October 2012, Roy Hodgson included Forster in his England squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland. On 8 November 2012, Forster was then named in Hodgson's England squad for their upcoming friendly against Sweden. On 14 March 2013, Hodgson again included Forster in his England squad, this time for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro. On 27 August 2013, Forster earned his fourth inclusion to the England squad ahead of the World Cup qualifiers with Moldova and Ukraine, joining Joe Hart and John Ruddy in competition for the goalkeeper's position.

Forster won his first cap for England on 15 November 2013 in a friendly match against Chile at Wembley Stadium. England lost 2–0 but Forster was "blameless" for both goals, making a "fine diving save" to deny Chile a third. This appearance against Chile saw Forster become only the second person ever to play for England while a Celtic player, after Alan Thompson in 2004.

On 12 May 2014, Hodgson named Forster in England's 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In England's last warm-up match before the tournament, on 7 June, he replaced Joe Hart for the last 15 minutes of a 0–0 draw with Honduras. Forster travelled to Brazil with the rest of the England squad but did not feature in any of the three matches England played.

A knee injury saw Forster miss most of 2015, but his form on returning to playing football in early 2016 earned him a recall to the England squad in March. He played the second half of England's 3–2 friendly win over Germany in Berlin, making an impressive save from a Marco Reus free kick, although later conceded a goal from a Mario Gómez header. Forster played the full 90 minutes three days later on 29 March 2016 in a 2–1 loss against the Netherlands. Both goals conceded were controversial; Danny Rose protesting that the handball that led to the penalty for the Netherlands first goal was not deliberate, while Phil Jagielka appeared to be fouled in the build-up to Luciano Narsingh's winning goal. Despite the defeat, Forster turned in a composed performance and made several excellent saves. On 31 May 2016, Forster was named in England's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, albeit he was once again understudy to Joe Hart and did not play in any of England's four matches at the tournament.

Following Euro 2016, Forster remained an unused substitute in subsequent England matches, and was dropped from the squad altogether in August 2017.

Despite his large build, Forster has a high level of agility; Ian Brown who coached him as a youth at Wallsend said that "he was and is an amazing shot stopper. I've seen him for Southampton save shots he shouldn't, his body bends." In one-on-situations, he appears to make his already large stature even bigger to an onrushing opponent.

Forster was, however, criticised in the early part of his time at Celtic for lacking confidence and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.

Steven Davis

Steven Davis (born 1 January 1985) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Scottish Premiership club Rangers on loan from Premier League club Southampton and the captain of the Northern Ireland national team. Davis made his full international debut in 2005 and has since been capped 100 times at senior level, scoring ten goals. He captained his nation at UEFA Euro 2016.

Davis began his career with Premier League club Aston Villa in 2004. He was named "Young Player of the Year", "The Fans Player of the Year" and "Player of the Year" for the 2005–06 season after making 42 appearances during the season. Davis was sold to Fulham for £4 million in the summer of 2007, but moved on loan to Scottish club Rangers in January 2008 for an initial six months. He was part of the team that reached the 2008 UEFA Cup Final and that won the 2007–08 Scottish League Cup and 2007–08 Scottish Cup. At the end of the season, he moved permanently to Rangers for £3 million. He made 211 appearances for the Glasgow club, winning three consecutive league titles in 2009, 2010 and 2011, two Scottish Cups and three League Cups. 

Following the club's insolvency in 2012, Davis exercised his rights under TUPE regulations to rescind his contract and become a free agent, returning to the Premier League with Southampton.

Davis, who was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, started his career at St Andrews Boys Club before transferring to Aston Villa in 2002. He was a member of the 2002 FA Youth Cup winning team that beat Everton 4–2 in the final. His first professional appearance was on 18 September 2004, he was a 57th-minute replacement for Nolberto Solano in a goalless Premier League match against Norwich City at Carrow Road. Davis made 28 league appearances across the season, scoring the winner in a 3–2 comeback victory at Southampton on 16 April 2005.

On 13 August 2005, in Villa's first game of the new campaign, Davis volleyed past Jussi Jääskeläinen to secure a 2–2 home draw against Bolton Wanderers, albeit after nine minutes. He scored twice on 20 September in the third round of the Football League Cup, as Villa won 8–3 at Wycombe Wanderers. By October 2005, he was a regular for the club and missed only one game for Villa in the 2005–06 season. Davis was named Villa's "Young Player of the Year", "The Fans Player of the Year" "and" "Player of the Year" for the 2005–06 season. His form prompted the Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez, to state that Davis could be "another Frank Lampard". Davis made 102 appearances for Villa and scored nine times. On 2 January 2006, he headed the first goal of a 2–1 win at rivals West Bromwich Albion.

In the summer of 2007, Davis followed teammate Aaron Hughes to Fulham on 5 July 2007 to team up with international manager Sanchez, for a fee of around £4 million. He made his Fulham debut against Arsenal on 12 August 2007 and made 22 appearances for Fulham before moving to Rangers.

On 31 January 2008, Davis was signed on a six-month loan by Rangers, the club he supported as a boy. Davis made his Rangers debut against Panathinaikos in the UEFA Cup on 13 February. He scored his first goal, again in European competition, against German team Werder Bremen. Davis scored for Rangers in the penalty shootout against Dundee United that won Rangers the League Cup. He also helped the team reach the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, and won the Scottish Cup in May.

Davis made his move from Fulham permanent on 21 August 2008, in a transfer worth £3 million, signing a four-year contract. He made his first appearance of the season for Rangers against Aberdeen, during a 1–1 draw the day after he permanently signed. Davis scored his first goal for Rangers, since his move became permanent, against Motherwell. He scored the only goal in the final Old Firm derby of the season on 9 May 2009, to take Rangers to the top of the SPL by two points. Davis won the SPL title and Scottish Cup with Rangers in the 2008–09 season.

Davis began his goalscoring in the 2009–10 season against St. Mirren on 27 January. He continued his goalscoring form against Falkirk in the next game, curling a free kick into Bobby Olejnik's top right hand corner. Davis's performances in January 2010, earned him the SPL Player of the Month award. He was also named PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year on 2 May 2010. and won the SPL and Scottish League Cup each for the second time.

Davis scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season against Motherwell at Ibrox in October 2010, when he collected the ball 30 yards from goal before striking it into the top corner. The goal drew comparisons to former Rangers favourite Ian Durrant. Davis followed this up by scoring the winning goal in the match against Inverness at Ibrox in January 2011. In the 2011 Scottish League Cup Final against Celtic, Davis opened the scoring in a match, which Rangers won 2–1 after extra time. This was the third time he had won the Scottish League Cup. Davis scored in back-to-back games in the 2011 title run in against Motherwell, and then Hearts, before playing his 54th, and final game of the season in a 5–1 win over Kilmarnock, as Rangers won their 3rd consecutive SPL championship.

On 19 July 2011, Davis signed a new five-year contract with Rangers. He was made Rangers temporary captain, with the absence of formal club captain David Weir for the first part of the 2011–12 season. Davis scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 2–0 win over Aberdeen at Ibrox in August. In the first Old Firm match of the 2011–12 season, Davis provided two assists in the game, as Rangers beat Celtic 4–2. After Rangers beat Dunfermline 4–0 at East End Park, Rangers manager Ally McCoist praised Davis's performance by saying "It was a captain's performance from the best player on the park." For his performances during September 2011, he received the SPL Player of the Month award. Following the insolvency of Rangers in 2012, Davis exercised his rights under TUPE regulations to rescind his contract and become a free agent. PFA Scotland had previously commented that players were entitled to become free agents if they objected to the transfer to the new company formed by Charles Green.

Davis rejected the chance to stay with Rangers and instead signed a three-year contract with Premier League club Southampton on 6 July 2012. The deal was subsequently extended to 2016 as part of the agreement with Rangers to complete the transfer without the need for the international transfer clearance to be agreed by FIFA, with the two clubs agreeing a fee. After joining Southampton, Davis pleaded the Rangers fans to agree with his decision to leave but accepted that a minority of fans would take a different view and made his explanation he left Rangers in order to revive his football career.

He made his debut on 19 August 2012, and scored to put the team ahead at holders Manchester City only three minutes after coming on as a substitute, but Southampton eventually lost 3–2. His only other goal of the season came against the same opposition, in a 3–1 home win on 13 February 2013.

His first two goals of the 2013–14 season came in a 5–1 victory at Barnsley in the League Cup second round on 27 August, the latter being a penalty.

On 17 October 2014, Davis signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until 2018.

On 8 May 2016, Davis scored his first ever league brace for Southampton in a 2–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. He followed this up with a goal in a 4–1 victory over Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.

On 18 June 2016, he signed a new three-year contract, extending his stay with the club until 2019.

He made his 200th Southampton appearance on 16 September 2017 against Crystal Palace, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 victory.

On 6 January 2019, Davis returned to Rangers on a six-month loan.

Davis' first goal came against Wales in a 3–2 home defeat in another qualifier on 8 October. He was also part of the team who beat Spain 3–2 at Windsor Park in September 2006.

On 21 May 2006, he became Northern Ireland's youngest modern day captain against Uruguay in the United States, a 1–0 loss.

On 8 October 2015, Davis scored twice in a 3–1 victory over Greece to help Northern Ireland qualify for the final tournament of Euro 2016, their first European Championship.

A native of the city of Southampton, McQueen joined the Southampton Academy at the age of eight and has remained with the club ever since. Handed his senior debut for the club in 2014, he plays primarily as a left-sided full back or winger.

McQueen was born in Southampton and attended The Mountbatten School in Romsey, Hampshire.

Boufal came through the Angers youth system, making his debut for the club at the age of 18, replacing Rayan Frikeche in the closing stages of a 1–0 home loss to FC Istres in August 2012. He made his first ever professional start the next Ligue 2 season, in a 4–2 win away at FC Istres, becoming a regular that season, making 31 appearances in all competitions. In the 2014–15 season, he helped Angers win promotion to Ligue 1. He racked up a total of 4 goals in 16 appearances in the first half of the season, before attracting interest from Ligue 1 clubs.

On 9 January 2015, Boufal transferred to Lille in Ligue 1, instantly making an impression, scoring 3 goals in 14 league games. The next season, he continued to impress, scoring 12 goals in 35 appearances in all competitions and attracted interest from some of the biggest clubs around the world.

On 29 August 2016, Southampton announced they had signed Boufal on a five-year contract for a club-record undisclosed fee. The fee was reported as £16 million, slightly more than the £15 million paid to Roma for Dani Osvaldo in October 2013.

In the 2016–17 season, Boufal scored only one League Cup goal and one Premier League goal; his strike in Saints' 26 October 2016 1–0 win over Sunderland in the fourth round of the League Cup won Southampton's Goal of the Season award.

On 21 October 2017, Boufal scored a virtuoso 85th-minute goal in a home tie against West Bromwich Albion to lead his team to a 1–0 victory and send them into the top half of the Premier League. Having come on as a substitute in the 80th minute, he gained possession deep within his own half and took the ball past six opposing players before sending it past keeper Ben Foster from just inside the box. This goal was voted the 2017–18 Premier League Goal of the Season.

In July 2018, Boufal joined La Liga side Celta Vigo on loan for the 2018–19 campaign.

Boufal made his debut for the Moroccan first team on 26 March 2016 starting in a 1–0 African Cup of Nations qualification victory against Cape Verde.

Jordy Clasie

Jordy Clasie (; born 27 June 1991) is a Dutch footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for Feyenoord, on loan from Southampton, and for the Dutch national team.

Clasie arrived at the youth Feyenoord Academy (Varkenoord) as a 9-year-old in the summer of 2000 and progressed through the ranks to the Feyenoord / Excelsior U19s. In the summer of 2010 the Haarlem-born youngster went out on loan to Excelsior. Clasie made his professional debut for Excelsior on 15 August 2010, when he was part of the starting line-up in the Rotterdam derby victory against Feyenoord (3–2).

Clasie was brought into the first-team squad at Feyenoord at the start of the 2011/2012 season and incoming coach Ronald Koeman immediately handed the youngster a place in the starting line-up. On 31 July 2011 he made his debut for Feyenoord in a friendly game against Málaga. Because of his good play and his tenacity he soon became one of the most popular players among the supporters.

On 29 August 2014, a day after Clasie helped Feyenoord qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, Clasie agreed to extend his contract until 2018. Clasie explained the decision that he was keen on developing himself as a player within the team as well as developing together with the team as a whole.

However, on 15 July 2015, Clasie signed for Southampton on a five-year deal for a fee in the region of £8 million. This meant he would once again link up with Ronald Koeman who brought him into the Feyenoord first-team.

In the summer of 2016, Frenchman Claude Puel took over at the helm of Southampton. Clasie then scored his first goal for the club on 30 November 2016, in a 2–0 win over Arsenal in the EFL Cup.
Clasie's creativity was instrumental in Southampton getting to the League Cup final of 2017 where the Saints eventually emerged as runners up.

He scored his first Premier League goal on 8 April 2017 in a 1–0 victory at West Bromwich Albion.

On 30 August 2017, Clasie joined Club Brugge on loan for the duration of the 2017–18 season.

On 25 July 2018, the midfielder rejoined Feyenoord on loan for the duration of the 2018–19 season.

In November 2010, two months after his debut for Excelsior, he was selected for the Netherlands U21 squad. In February 2012, Bert van Marwijk, the coach of the first team of the Netherlands, pronounced his interest in Clasie. He was made aware that his name was on the stand-by list for Euro 2012.

Clasie was part of Louis van Gaal's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil where the Dutch finished third beating the likes of defending champions Spain and hosts Brazil.
He made two appearances in the tournament, coming on as a substitute for Nigel de Jong in the semi-finals against Argentina and started the third place game against the hosts which the Dutch won 3–0 comfortably.

As a combative midfielder with an eye for goal, Clasie's style of play has earned him the label of the "Dutch Xavi".
