'''Kasper Peter Schmeichel''' ({{IPA-da|kasbɐ ˈsmɑjˀɡl̩}}; born 5 November 1986) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|LeicestC}} club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]]. He is the son of former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and Danish international goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]].

Schmeichel began his career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but he had loan spells with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] before he made his Manchester City debut. Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 jersey his own at the start of the 2007–08 season, the emergence of [[Joe Hart]] resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. The signing of Republic of Ireland international [[Shay Given]] in January 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and in August 2009, he was allowed to link up with former manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in May 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to Leicester City, where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel has gone on to play over 300 competitive games for Leicester, winning the Championship in the 2013–14 season and the Premier League in 2015–16.

He played 17 games for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark national under-21 team]]. Schmeichel was called up to the Denmark national team for the first time against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 13 May 2011,&lt;ref name="translate.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.dk/fodbold/olsen-overrasker-udtager-schmeichel |title=Olsen overrasker: Udtager Schmeichel |newspaper=BT |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of their squad at [[UEFA Euro 2012]], but did not make his senior debut until 2013.

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
Born in [[Copenhagen]],&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Schmeichel joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in September 2002 on a long-term contract, which covered schoolboy, scholar and professional terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel's son joins Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/2241867.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2002 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] on a loan deal in January 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel joins Quakers on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/darlington/4610178.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made his professional first team debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the [[96.6 TFM Arena]] on 14 January 2006. Darlington won the game 2–1, with Schmeichel conceding a goal to Peterborough striker [[James Quinn (footballer)|James Quinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darlington 2–1 Peterborough |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4590336.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained his first [[clean sheet]] three days later against [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. He made two further appearances before returning to Manchester City.

One month after returning to Manchester City he was loaned out again, this time to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bury sign Man City's Schmeichel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bury/4736578.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made 15 appearances in a three-month loan spell. He returned to Bury for a further three months the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel returns to Gigg Lane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bury/5279498.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmeichel joined [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] on loan from January 2007 until the end of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel gets Falkirk loan move |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/6251405.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[man of the match]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 18 February 2007. He also saved a [[Craig Beattie]] penalty in a 1–0 win over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on 18 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/6456637.stm |title=Falkirk 1–0 Celtic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revealed in May he would have liked his loan at Falkirk extended, and the club expressed an interest in signing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel keen on Falkirk stay |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/6574929.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Falkirk target Schmeichel switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/6224204.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kasper Schmeichel 2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Schmeichel playing for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2007]]

Schmeichel made his Manchester City debut against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=West Ham 0–2 Man City |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6931065.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played against City's rivals and his boyhood team [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 19 August 2007 and kept a clean sheet in City's 1–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Man City 1–0 Man Utd |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6941879.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeichel saved a penalty from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] [[Robin van Persie]] on 25 August 2007 at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Despite City losing 1–0 to Arsenal he was named man of the match. He played the first seven of Manchester City's games in the [[2007–08 Premier League]], keeping clean sheets against Manchester United, West Ham, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], conceding only five goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Soccerbase season|37210|2007|name=Kasper Schmeichel|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kasper Schmeichel 2006.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Schmeichel making a save during training while on loan at [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on 23 September 2006]]
He signed a new four-year deal with City in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel pens new Man City deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7009246.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was then followed up with an agreement to go on a one-month loan with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 25 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff seal Schmeichel loan deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7062022.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Cardiff on 27 October 2007 in a 1–1 draw with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff 1–1 Scunthorpe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7054123.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named 2007 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish Under-21 Talent of the Year]].&lt;ref name="arla"&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel årets Arla-talent |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=242463 |publisher=Danish Football Association |language=Danish |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the loan spell, Schmeichel requested that he would be allowed to stay on at Cardiff for a longer period and on 22 November, the loan spell was extended until the new year, with manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City do not suffer an injury crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kasper can stay at Ninian into the new year |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kasper-can-stay-ninian-new-2219786 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Eriksson named [[Joe Hart]] as the number one goalkeeper at Manchester City, however, [[Andreas Isaksson]] requested a transfer. This meant that Eriksson would not allow Cardiff to keep Schmeichel after his initial loan period ended on 2 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kasper ready to ghost away from Ninian following Sven's summons |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kasper-ready-ghost-away-ninian-2213019 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December, Eriksson threw Cardiff a lifeline by opening talks for Schmeichel to stay at [[Ninian Park]]. Schmeichel would be allowed to stay for two more matches should Isaksson not move until late in the January transfer window. Schmeichel had stated he would like to play for Cardiff again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Phillips |title=Sven's new year gift to Cardiff City |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/svens-new-year-gift-cardiff-2214180 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Tucker |title=Schmeichel content to extend Cardiff stay |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/schmeichel-content-extend-cardiff-stay-2199716 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeichel, however, returned to [[City of Manchester Stadium|Eastlands]] the day after his initial loan expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~1205866,00.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526210350/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~1205866%2C00.html |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Kasper returns to Manchester City |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on loan until the end of the season on 13 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10269~1264260,00.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526210351/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10269~1264260%2C00.html |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Sky Blues agree Schmeichel deal |publisher=Coventry City F.C. |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the season, his father, [[Peter Schmeichel]], commented during a TV interview that his son was not happy at Manchester City and was set to leave following the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel set for Man City exit |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7351151.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite wanting to leave, Schmeichel returned to the City of Manchester Stadium at the end of the season and changed to the number 16 shirt. He repeatedly stated that he wanted to leave City and regretted signing a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schmeichel wants City exit |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_3974080,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kasper Schmeichel (1240546579).jpg|thumb|left|230px|Schmeichel during a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2007]]

On 16 November, Schmeichel entered a game as a substitute after Joe Hart injured his ankle in the 14th minute. City went on to a 2–2 result with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |title=Hull 2–2 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7715659.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 November 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Schmeichel played his last game for Manchester City in a [[UEFA Cup]] match against [[Racing de Santander]].&lt;ref name="thisisnottingham.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Brave-Schmeichel-deserves-World-Cup-place-says-Backe/story-12207172-detail/story.html |title=Notts County manager Hans Backe believes Kasper Schmeichel has a bright future ahead of him |newspaper=Nottingham Post |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208002928/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Brave-Schmeichel-deserves-World-Cup-place-says-Backe/story-12207172-detail/story.html |archivedate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2009, he stated in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that he was ready to quit the club after falling down the pecking order at Eastlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monday's gossip column |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/7811007.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notts County===
On 14 August 2009, Schmeichel signed for League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in a deal that is believed to have broken the club's previous transfer record.

The reasoning behind this was financial: Schmeichel earned a reported £15,000 per week, having been signed during the brief ownership period of high-spending [[Qadbak Investments|Munto Finance]] in the summer 2009. Schmeichel agreed to forgo all his future wages, something which chairman [[Ray Trew]] described as "a huge concession by such a young man".&lt;ref name="Notts County to tear up Kasper Schmeichel deal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Notts County to tear up Kasper Schmeichel deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/8647725.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2010, having been linked with both [[Premier League]] and [[Bundesliga]] clubs, Schmeichel signed a two-year contract with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], joining the club on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref name="Kasper becomes first summer recruit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kasper becomes first summer recruit |url=http://origin-www.leedsunited.com/news/20100527/kasper-becomes-first-summer-recruit_2247585_2060450 |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C. |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207222741/http://origin-www.leedsunited.com/news/20100527/kasper-becomes-first-summer-recruit_2247585_2060450 |archivedate=7 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010–11 season squad number announcement, Schmeichel was given the number 1 shirt at Leeds. After much speculation during the pre-season over who would be Leeds' first choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season, it was Schmeichel who was given the nod ahead of [[Shane Higgs]]. He made his debut for the club on Saturday 7 August 2010 in Leeds' opening Football League Championship match against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. Despite Leeds losing 2–1, Schmeichel put in an impressive performance, making several crucial saves during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leeds-united/7931894/Leeds-United-1-Derby-County-2-match-report.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=Leeds United 1 Derby County 2: match report |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |location=London |first=Duncan |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a string of impressive games for Leeds, Schmeichel was nominated for the August Championship Player of the Month award, but lost out to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] winger [[Adel Taarabt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8984819.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Warnock and Taarabt scoop awards |date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeichel, however, did win [[Sky Sports]] Championship Player of the Month award for August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11715_6354496,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Best of the month |date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After picking up a tendon injury in his foot, Schmeichel missed the game against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and was ruled out of Leeds' next few games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/1fsb8k9l1yn5d1ovz8b46d95t6/title/kasper-out-as-brown-joins-on-loan |title=News &amp;#124; Leeds |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C. |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While out injured, Schmeichel appeared on ''[[Soccer AM]]'' as one of the guests on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.leedsunited.com/news/20100921/kaspers-interview-soccer-am_2247585_2160628 |title=News &amp;#124; Leeds |publisher=Leeds United A.F.C. |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207222747/http://origin-www.leedsunited.com/news/20100921/kaspers-interview-soccer-am_2247585_2160628 |archivedate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After just under two months out, Schmeichel returned to the Leeds starting line-up against Cardiff City.

===Leicester City===
====2011–12 season====
[[File:Schmeichel vs Chelsea.jpg|thumb|200px|Schmeichel playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2012]]
On 27 June 2011, Schmeichel was officially confirmed as a Leicester player, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee that reunited him for a second time with his former Manchester City and Notts County manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson.

In the first month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a seemingly needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's [[Lewis McGugan]] was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not know he had received the first of the yellow cards. "I didn't know I had been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would never have done that," he said on his personal [[Twitter]] page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/14514759.stm Nottingham Forest v Leicester City match report.] BBC Sport.

Retrieved 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning him plaudits, with his then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing him with [[England national football team|England]] number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart,&lt;ref name="Kasper Schmeichel as good as Hart - Sven-Goran Eriksson"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kasper Schmeichel as good as Hart – Sven-Goran Eriksson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/15006682.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teammate and former England international [[Paul Konchesky]] describing him as "one of the best [goalkeepers] he has ever played with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Konchesky hails in-form Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Konchesky-hails-form-Leicester-City-goalkeeper/story-14019188-detail/story.html |newspaper=Leicester Mercury |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214914/https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Konchesky-hails-form-Leicester-City-goalkeeper/story-14019188-detail/story.html |archivedate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short-distant reaction save against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager [[Michael Appleton]] as "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portsmouth 1–1 Leicester: Sunday Mirror match report |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Portsmouth-1-1-Leicester-City-David-Nugent-haunts-old-club-as-he-grabs-the-equaliser-article835365.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Leicester manager [[Nigel Pearson]] as "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We must do better, says Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/better-says-Leicester-City-boss-Nigel-Pearson/story-13978179-detail/story.html |newspaper=Leicester Mercury |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210215733/https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/better-says-Leicester-City-boss-Nigel-Pearson/story-13978179-detail/story.html |archivedate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmeichel played a total of 52 games overall, making 17 clean sheets and saving four penalties. His performances in the [[2011–12 Leicester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]] earned him the club's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards on 30 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2755427,00.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805050551/https://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2755427%2C00.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 |title=Schmeichel Crowned Player of the Year |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Schmeichel's form in the first half of the [[2012–13 Leicester City F.C. season|2012–13 season]] surpassed that of the previous season, keeping 12 clean sheets in 28 games, the most in the league as the Foxes sat second in the table, such performances earning him links with [[La Liga]] giants [[Real Madrid C.F|Real Madrid]] and also leading to his first senior [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] cap. A particular highlight was a spectacular save against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in February. On 16 April 2013, he made his 100th Leicester appearance in a 3–2 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Schmeichel's performances earned him a place in the 2012–13 Championship PFA Team of the Year, alongside club captain [[Wes Morgan]].

====2013–14 season====
During the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 season]], Schmeichel kept nine clean sheets during a 19-game unbeaten run spanning from December to April to help guarantee Leicester promotion from the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] with six games to spare. Schmeichel's high quality performances once again lead to him being courted by some of world football's giants, with both Manchester United and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] being linked with moves for the Danish international during the January transfer window.

In March, TV footage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/leicester-keeper-kasper-schmeichel-should-have-been-awarded-injury-time-goal-v-yeovil-header-crossed-the-line-vine/ |date=25 March 2014 |title=Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel scores injury time header Yeovil! [Vine]}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to support Schmeichel's claim that he had scored what would have been the first goal of his career, when Leicester equalised, in injury time, against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]]. However, the match officials ruled that his header had not crossed the line and the goal was officially credited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/294725.html |date=26 March 2014 |title=Spoilsports! League deny Schmeichel goal}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Chris Wood (footballer, born 1991)|Chris Wood]], who followed up to put the ball in the net.

At the end of the [[2013–14 Leicester City F.C. season|2013–14 season]], it was announced that Schmeichel had signed a four-year contract extension until the summer of 2018 with Leicester.&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;{{cite web |title=Schmeichel Signs New Leicester City Deal |url=https://www.lcfc.com/news/article/040614-schmeichel-signs-new-leicester-city-deal-1602227.aspx |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Leicester's [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|first Champions League campaign]], Schmeichel saved a penalty in each leg of the last 16 tie with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] – from [[Joaquín Correa]] and [[Steven Nzonzi]] respectively – as the Foxes advanced 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ronay |first1=Barney |title=Kasper Schmeichel's Champions League brilliance confirms his rise to the elite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/mar/15/kasper-schmeichel-champions-league-leicester-steven-nzonzi |accessdate=15 March 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
On 26 August 2017, Schmeichel saved a [[Romelu Lukaku]] penalty away at Manchester United in the 53rd minute, with the score at 0–0.

====2018–19 season====
Schmeichel witnessed the [[2018 Leicester City F.C. helicopter crash|helicopter crash]] on 27 October 2018 that killed five people including Leicester owner [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mannion |first1=Damian |title=Kasper Schmeichel ‘saw some terrible things’ Leicester manager Claude Puel says in emotional press conference |url=https://talksport.com/football/440877/leicester-helicopter-crash-schmeichel-police/ |publisher=Talksport |date=2 November 2018 |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth===
While at Manchester City, Schmeichel was called up for the [[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark national under-19 team]] in August 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=24311 |title=Schmeichel på U/19-landsholdet |publisher=Danish Football Association |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his international debut in a 0–0 draw with [[Northern Ireland national under-19 football team|Northern Ireland]] on 2 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=24780 |title=God debut til Schmeichel |publisher=Danish Football Association |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play eight under-19 internationals until March 2005, competing with [[Kenneth Stenild]] and [[Michael Tørnes]] for the goalkeeping spot. He was called up for the [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] team in October 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=38719 |title=Schmeichel på U/20 –landsholdet |publisher=Danish Football Association |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not play for the team until October 2006, during his time at Bury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=234918 |title=Unødvendigt nederlag mod Norge |publisher=Danish Football Association |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after his under-20 debut, Schmeichel was asked to train with the senior [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] team and was called up as a replacement for injured [[Theis Rasmussen]] in the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=234938 |title=Rommedahl ude, Krohn-Dehli inde |publisher=Danish Football Association |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmeichel was one of the leading players in the team, and was named [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish under-21 Talent of the Year]] in November 2007, following three clean sheets in the previous four under-21 games.&lt;ref name="arla"/&gt; He played a total 17 under-21 internationals in a row from March 2007 to October 2008, racking up seven clean sheets.

===Senior===
Following his strong showings for Manchester City in the early [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]], it was reported on 23 August 2007 that [[The Football Association]] (FA) were investigating Schmeichel's international status, to see if there was any chance of him foregoing his Danish international status in order to play for [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FA woo Kasper |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/fa-woo-kasper-714795 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeichel, however, stated that he would only ever play for Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikolaj |last=Worm |title=England kan glemme alt om Schmeichel |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/sport/fodbold/article1055767.ece |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmeichel was called up to the Danish senior team on 13 May 2011 for the first time for the match against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], but remained an unused substitute.&lt;ref name="translate.google.co.uk"/&gt; On 29 May 2012, he was called up for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] as a third goalkeeper after it became clear that [[Thomas Sørensen]] would miss the tournament due to an injury sustained against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Thomas-Soerensen-ude-af-EM |title=Thomas Sørensen ude af EM |website=bold.dk |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeichel made his senior debut in a 3–0 friendly match defeat to [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] at the [[Philip II Arena]] on 6 February 2013.&lt;ref name="Macedonia 3 - 0 Denmark"&gt;{{citation |title=Macedonia 3 – 0 Denmark |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/international-friendlies/2013/macedonia-denmark-587659.html |publisher=Yahoo Eurosport UK |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2013, Schmeichel had his first ever senior level game in his native Denmark, when he held an easy clean sheet in Denmark's 6–0 win against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in the last [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group B|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. Denmark were eventually runners-up in the group, finishing six points behind [[Italy national football team|Italy]], but they did not progress to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|play-offs]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|finals]] as they were the lowest-ranked team of the nine runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Young Denmark put six past Malta |url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/matches/round=2000294/match=2008563/index.html |publisher=UEFA |date=15 October 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2014, Schmeichel received his third cap for Denmark in their 1–0 friendly defeat against England at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Despite defeat, Schmeichel pulled off a string of impressive saves earning plaudits from the media as well as England manager [[Roy Hodgson]].

Schmeichel was selected for the Danish squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], where he started in three group stage matches. His clean sheet in the opening match contributed to a [[Player of the match|Man of the Match]] award and helped Schmeichel set a new record for minutes without conceding a goal for Denmark, surpassing his father's record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelner |first=Martha |date=20 June 2018 |title=Kasper Schmeichel breaks dad’s Denmark record but puts wins first |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/kasper-schmeichel-denmark-australia |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martel |first=Brett |date=16 June 2018 |title=Schmeichel, Poulsen lift Denmark past Peru 1–0 |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/worldcup/2018/06/16/schmeichel-poulsen-lift-denmark-past-peru-1-0.html |newspaper=The Star |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Denmark vs Croatia|Round of 16]] match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], Schmeichel was named Man of the Match after saving a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty-kick]] taken by [[Luka Modrić]] in [[Overtime (sports)|extra-time]] and two penalties during the subsequent [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|shootout]], although his opposing counterpart [[Danijel Subašić]] saved three penalties in that shootout to eliminate Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2018 |title=Croatia 1–1 Denmark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jul/01/croatia-v-denmark-world-cup-2018-live?page=with:block-5b393c94e4b0c089ab2b8901#block-5b393c94e4b0c089ab2b8901 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/schmeichel-s-hat-trick-not-enough |title=Schmeichel's hat-trick not enough |publisher=FIFA |access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Peter Simpson''' (born 4 January 1987) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[right back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

A product of the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] academy, during his development Simpson played on loan for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in England, and [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in Belgium. He was on loan at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for six months before signing for them on a permanent basis in January 2010, and after four years joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a free transfer in June 2013 for a year, before joining Leicester City the following season.

==Career==
===Manchester United===
Simpson was born in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], [[Greater Manchester]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; to a Jamaican father and English mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/sport/JFF-nets-eight---Beckford--McAnuff-among-recruits-from-UK-trip_13066699 |title=JFF nets eight – Beckford, McAnuff among recruits from UK trip |first=Jamaica Observer |last=Limited |website=Jamaica Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson played for Parkwyddn JFC in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] as a youth before being picked up by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He is a product of the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United youth system]], having come up through the ranks into the reserve squad in 2005.

Simpson made his debut against South African team [[Kaizer Chiefs FC|Kaizer Chiefs]] on 18 July 2006, which the Reds won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kaizer Chiefs 0–1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/5193126.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Alex Ferguson claimed that Simpson looked "anything but a player making his first start for Manchester United".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

====Royal Antwerp (loan)====
In early January 2006, he was sent on loan, along with three other United youths, to the [[Belgian Second Division]] club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] for the remainder of the season, to gain match experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Another United loanee |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_2362508,00.html |work=Sky Sports |publisher=BSkyB |date=7 January 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson also spent the first half of the 2006–07 season at Antwerp before returning to United in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Youngsters join Antwerp |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=355888 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=18 August 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918045750/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=355888 |archive-date=18 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunderland (loan)====
On 25 January 2007, he joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on loan for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunderland sign Simpson on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6300117.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 January 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan move saw him link up with fellow Manchester United player [[Jonny Evans]]. He won the Championship title with Sunderland that season.

====Return to Manchester United====
Simpson returned to United at the start of the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season|2007–08 season]] and signed a new contract in September 2007 that would keep him at the club until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd hand new deal to Simpson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6979964.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 September 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first competitive appearance for United on 26 September 2007 in the 2–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] loss to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 0–2 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008020.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after made his [[Premier League]] debut on 6 October 2007 against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at [[Old Trafford]], coming on as a 30th-minute [[substitute (football)|substitute]] for the injured [[John O'Shea]]. He set up the fourth goal with a well flighted cross for [[Wayne Rooney]]. The match ended with a 4–0 win to United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Sinnott |title=Man Utd 4–0 Wigan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7019619.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His European debut came on 23 October 2007, when he came on as an 80th-minute substitute for [[Ryan Giggs]] against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |title=Dynamo Kiev 2–4 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7054215.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first European start was in the reverse fixture against Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007; United won the game 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 4–0 Dynamo Kiev |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7076590.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 November 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ipswich Town (loan)====
On 21 March 2008, Simpson signed a loan deal with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. With [[Gary Neville]] on the verge of returning to the Manchester United first team, United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] decided it was best for Simpson to get as much first team football as possible, something that would be quite hard to come by at Old Trafford with both Gary Neville and [[Wes Brown]] ahead of Simpson in the pecking order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bostock |title=Simpson out as Nev nears return |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=543149 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324124052/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=543149 |archive-date=24 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blackburn Rovers (loan)====
On 4 August 2008, Simpson signed for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on a season-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Simmo joins Rovers on loan |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6615332 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014201455/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=6615332 |archive-date=14 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn sign Man Utd's Simpson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7541677.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson made his Blackburn debut on 27 August 2008, playing in Rovers' 4–1 win over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Second Round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn 4–1 Grimsby |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7576508.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2008 |accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Premier League debut for Blackburn Rovers came almost three weeks later, on 13 September 2008, in a 4–0 defeat at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Lyon |title=Blackburn 0–4 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7601879.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the exception of Blackburn's League Cup Fifth Round defeat by Manchester United, which he was forced to miss because of a clause in his loan agreement, Simpson was ever-present for Blackburn during their League Cup and FA Cup campaigns. He also played in 11 out of the 14 league matches for which he was eligible prior to Christmas 2008, although he was named on the bench for the other three. After Christmas, Simpson only played in one further league match, another 4–0 defeat to Arsenal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Arsenal 4–0 Blackburn |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7944245.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 March 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early May 2009, with his first team opportunities limited at Blackburn, the loan agreement was terminated early and he returned to train with Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Burton |title=Home form gives Sam hope |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_5299066,00.html |work=Sky Sports |publisher=BSkyB |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
[[File:Danny Simpson - 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2009]]

On 14 August 2009, Simpson joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on loan until January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson makes Magpies loan switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8201408.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making his debut in a 1–0 victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at St. James' Park. He scored his first goal for Newcastle against Peterborough United on 7 November 2009.

Following the completion of the loan deal, Newcastle made a bid to keep Simpson on a permanent basis. An undisclosed fee, reported as being in the region of £750,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everton keen on loan move for Arsenal's Philippe Senderos |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article6995850.ece |work=The Times |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010 |location=London |first1=Gary |last1=Jacob |first2=Tony |last2=Barrett |first3=George |last3=Caulkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; was agreed between Newcastle and Manchester United and Simpson signed a three-and-a-half-year contract on 20 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newcastle sign Manchester United defender Danny Simpson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8469941.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a solid part in Newcastle's promotion to the Premier League, winning his second Championship title in the process, while forming a right flank partnership with January signing [[Wayne Routledge]]. Towards the end of the season, he "played through the pain" with what he considered a small ankle injury. He only realised the full extent of the ankle injury at the end of the season, and he had an operation to correct it. He was out for three months, including the first month or so of Newcastle's season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Douglas |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-simpson-reveals-full-injury-1416407 |title=Danny Simpson reveals his full injury blow |publisher=Chronicle Live |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson returned to action from his injury lay off, playing two reserve games in October. He made his first start of the new season in Newcastle's 2–1 victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], replacing [[James Perch]] at right back. Simpson kept his right-back spot with consistently strong performances, forming a strong partnership with [[Joey Barton]] on the right flank.

On 20 September 2011, Simpson scored a curler in Newcastle's 4–3 win over [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].

On 10 December 2011, Simpson started alongside [[James Perch]] at center back in place of the injured [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]] and [[Fabricio Coloccini]] for Newcastle's 4–2 defeat at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. He had played at right back for the beginning of the season.

On 4 January 2012, Simpson started for Newcastle during their 3–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and produced a fantastic saving clearance off the line against his old club on his 25th birthday.

After his contract with Newcastle expired at the end of the 2012–13 season, Simpson signed a three-year deal with Championship club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 27 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Simpson Signs |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/news/article/270613-exclusive-simpson-signs-882907.aspx |publisher=Queens Park Rangers F.C. |accessdate=28 June 2013 |date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for QPR in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 6 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exeter 0–2 QPR |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23499499 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 36 Championship appearances for QPR as they earned promotion via [[2015 Football League play-offs|the play-offs]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Leicester City===
[[File:Danny Simpson LCFC.jpg|thumb|Simpson and his daughter celebrating Leicester's title win on 7 May 2016]]
On 30 August 2014 signed a three-year contract for fellow promoted team [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="simpson_leicester"&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Simpson joins Leicester City from QPR on three-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28998920 |accessdate=21 May 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson made his Leicester debut in a 2–0 defeat against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] off the bench on 27 September 2014. However, he didn't make his second appearance for the club until 7 December against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], as he often struggled to get into the side ahead of regular right back [[Ritchie De Laet]]. Simpson made 14 appearances overall for Leicester in the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Danny Simpson |url=http://www.foxestalk.co.uk/forums/history/players?pid=1541 |website=FoxesTalk – History |accessdate=12 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024090438/http://www.foxestalk.co.uk/forums/history/players?pid=1541 |archivedate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015–16 season, under the new management of [[Claudio Ranieri]], De Laet was again preferred ahead of Simpson to begin with. However, following a 5–2 defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Ranieri changed his full backs bringing Simpson in for De Laet helping to shore up Leicester's defence, as Simpson was considered a much more defensive full-back than De Laet and "rarely ventured forward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Claudio Ranieri's tactics put his rivals to shame at Leicester City |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/04/30/how-claudio-ranieris-tactics-put-his-rivals-to-shame-at-leiceste/ |last=Gill |first=JJ |date=30 April 2016 |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson became a regular for the rest of the season, though was sent-off in the return fixture against Arsenal as Leicester went down to a late 2–1 defeat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35515144 |title=Arsenal 2–1 Leicester |date=14 February 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Foxes held on to win their first ever Premier League title.

==Personal life==
Simpson has a daughter, who was born six weeks prematurely in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-simpson-reaching-skye-after-1402352 |location=Newcastle |work=Evening Chronicle |first=Lee |last=Ryder |title=Danny Simpson reaching for Skye after birth |date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2015, Simpson was found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend and mother of his child Stephanie Ward on 28 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Simpson convicted of assaulting ex-girlfriend |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32820683 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33154782 |title=Danny Simpson to face Leicester hearing after assault sentence |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2016, his sentence was reviewed in light of press-intrusion into his community service, and replaced with a 22:00 to 06:00 curfew for 21 days.&lt;ref name=BBC36276824&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36276824 |title=Leicester City's Danny Simpson spared community service due to press intrusion |date=12 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Westley Nathan Morgan''' (born 21 January 1984) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for and is captain of [[Premier League]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and formerly the [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica national team]].

Morgan spent the majority of his career with his boyhood club, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], playing 402 matches and scoring 14 goals. He was their longest-serving player when he transferred to Leicester City in January 2012. Morgan became Leicester's captain later that year, and has gone on to play over 200 matches in all competitions for them, captaining them to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] title in 2014 and their first Premier League title two years later. He was the first Jamaican player to score in a [[UEFA Champions League]] game.

Born and raised in England, Morgan chose to represent his ancestral Jamaica at international level, making his debut for them in 2013. He was part of their teams that competed in two [[Copa América]] tournaments and finished runners-up at [[2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup|the 2015]] [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

==Career==
===Nottingham Forest===
====Early years====
[[File:Wes Morgan.jpg|thumb|upright|Morgan playing for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in 2002]]

Morgan was born in [[Nottingham]], [[Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010/11"/&gt; Having been rejected by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]'s near neighbours [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] at the age of 15, he went to study business at [[South Notts College]] while playing semi-professionally in central midfield for [[Dunkirk F.C.|Dunkirk]] in the [[Midland Football Alliance]]. His performances were tracked by non-League teams and Forest, who took him as an apprentice while he continued studying. There was no transfer fee, but Dunkirk received two Forest kits. Their clubhouse has his Forest and Leicester shirts on the wall.&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt;

In February 2003, with manager [[Paul Hart]] considering him close to a first-team breakthrough after his reserve performances, Morgan was loaned to [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livie |first1=Alex |title=Harriers set to land Morgan |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11727/2258897/harriers-set-to-land-morgan |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on 1 March, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–3 loss to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] at [[Aggborough]], deflecting a 25-yard [[Peter Beagrie]] shot for the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidderminster 1–3 Scunthorpe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2789937.stm |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan totalled five appearances for the [[Worcestershire]] side, scoring his first goal two weeks after his debut, heading to confirm a 2–0 victory at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cambridge 0–2 Kidderminster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2830303.stm |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart wanted Morgan to lose weight before joining the first team, which became a priority as the team had lost several players after losing in the last season's play-offs.&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt; He made his debut at left-back on 12 August 2003 away to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] at the age of 19; after a goalless draw, Forest won a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] to advance to the second round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Port Vale 0–0 Nottm Forest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3141401.stm |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later he made his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut in a 3–0 loss to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]; Hart considered him the [[man of the match]].&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt; On 18 October, he scored his first goal for Forest, heading [[Eoin Jess]]' cross to finish a 6–0 win over bottom team [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] at the [[City Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottm Forest 6–0 Wimbledon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3187030.stm |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He totalled 32 games across the season, also scoring an equaliser on 3 December in the home game against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], and was sent off twice over the campaign.

====First-team regular====
In the [[2007–08 Football League One|2007–08 campaign]], Morgan missed only four games all season, as he helped Forest finish second in the league and gain promotion from [[EFL League One|League One]] to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref name=forrest-promotion&gt;{{cite news |title=Nott'm Forest 3–2 Yeovil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/7368704.stm |accessdate=19 December 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only goal of the season came in a 2–0 victory at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], while Forest kept a season-record 24 clean sheets.

Morgan found it hard adapting to life back in the Championship during the first half of the 2008–09 season, with Forest languishing in the relegation zone by Christmas. Following the dismissal of [[Colin Calderwood]] on Boxing Day 2008, and the arrival of Billy Davies soon after, Morgan and the Forest defence looked far more solid as the season progressed which eventually led to the Reds retaining their Championship status. At the end of the 2008–09 season he had made a total of 274 appearances in all competitions, including 255 starts.

October 2011 saw Wes Morgan make his 400th appearance for Nottingham Forest against Hull City in a match in which he was also handed the captaincy.

On 20 January 2012, Nottingham Forest announced they rejected a bid for Morgan from local rivals Leicester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2583311,00.html |title=News &amp;#124; Foxes Bid Rejected |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |accessdate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064745/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2583311,00.html |archivedate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leicester City===
[[File:Leicester 0 Chelsea 3 (31479771124).jpg|thumb|upright|Morgan (left) playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2017]]

On 30 January 2012, Morgan joined East Midland rivals [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1&amp;nbsp;million. As a result of his performances towards the end of the [[2011–12 Leicester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]], he was awarded with the Leicester City captaincy ahead of the [[2012–13 Leicester City F.C. season|2012–13 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16755706 |title=Leicester sign Wes Morgan from Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His impressive performances early on earned him a nomination for [[EFL Championship Player of the Month|Championship Player of the Month]] for September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Award Nominations For Nigel And Wes |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/111012-award-nominations-for-nigel-and-wes-420011.aspx |publisher=LCFC.com |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester won the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 Championship]], in which he missed only one game.&lt;ref name=contract/&gt; Afterwards, the club used a clause in his would-be expired contract to keep him for another season;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news |title=Wes Morgan set to sign new deal with Leicester City |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/WES-SET-SIGN-NEW-CITY-DEAL/story-21230708-detail/story.html |accessdate=19 December 2015 |work=Leicester Mercury |date=13 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824225103/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/WES-SET-SIGN-NEW-CITY-DEAL/story-21230708-detail/story.html |archivedate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually signed a new three-year deal.&lt;ref name=contract&gt;{{cite news |title=Wes Morgan Signs New Leicester City Contract |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/040714-wes-morgan-signs-new-leicester-city-contract-1717920.aspx |accessdate=4 May 2016 |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Premier League]] for the [[2014–15 Leicester City F.C. season|2014–15 season]], Morgan scored his first goal of the season in a 4–3 defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 21 March 2015, and another in 3–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] on the 5 May. On 19 April 2015, Morgan was selected in the "[[Football League Awards#2015 Awards|Football Manager Team of the Decade]]" at the [[Football League Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winners announced for The Football League Awards 2015 |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/news/article/2015/winners-announced-for-the-football-league-awards-2015-2412148.aspx |publisher=The Football League |accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan kept his place for the [[2015–16 Leicester City F.C. season|2015–16 season]], playing in every minute of all 38 Premier League matches,&lt;ref name="soccerbase"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wes Morgan |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34659 |website=Soccerbase |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of only 4 players to achieve that accolade (including teammate Kasper Schmeichel) in that season. On 3 April 2016, he scored the only goal against Southampton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gheerbrant |first1=James |title=Leicester City 1–0 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35906375 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |publisher=BBC |date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite feeling ill.&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt; On 1 May, he equalised with a header in a 1–1 draw with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], and the next day Leicester won the title, with Morgan becoming the first Jamaican to win a Premier League medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City: The ridiculous statistics |url=http://www.football365.com/news/leicester-city-the-ridiculous-statistics |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=Football 365 |date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After captaining Leicester City to the title, Morgan was included in the Premier League [[PFA Team of the Year]], alongside teammates [[Jamie Vardy]], [[N'Golo Kanté]] and [[Riyad Mahrez]].&lt;ref name=pfa/&gt; He also became the third outfield player in Premier League history to play every minute of a title-winning season after [[Gary Pallister]] in 1992–93 and [[John Terry]] in 2014–15.&lt;ref name="Chelsea 1-1 Leicester City"&gt;{{cite|title = Chelsea 1–1 Leicester City|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36240331#tab-0|publisher = BBC Sport|author = Shamoon Hafez|date = 15 May 2016|accessdate = 12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] said "Wes Morgan is [[Baloo]] off ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. He is a big gentle bear who looks after all the lads. He does not speak so much but when he does speak, everybody listens. He is the perfect captain. I never knew anything about him before I came here. But I watched all the matches, I watched how solid, strong and intelligent he was".&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite news |last1=Percy |first1=John |title=Wes Morgan: The making of the Leicester City captain |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/04/16/wes-morgan-the-making-of-the-leicester-city-captain/ |accessdate=3 May 2016 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2017, he scored the first goal in Leicester's 2–0 win against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], contributing to a 3–2 aggregate score which allowed the club to qualify for the quarter-finals of the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. This also made him the first Jamaican player to score in a Champions League game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Leicester City 2–0 Sevilla (3–2 agg) |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39248930 |accessdate=17 March 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 1 September 2013, Morgan was called up to the [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaican squad]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City's Wes Morgan gets chance to fulfil World Cup dream |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-s-Wes-Morgan-gets-chance-fulfil/story-19743916-detail/story.html |accessdate=11 March 2016 |work=Leicester Mercury |date=3 September 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wes answers Jamaica call"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wes answers Jamaica call |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/020913-morgan-answers-jamaica-call-1030015.aspx |work=LCFC.com |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 0–0 draw against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] at the [[Estadio Rommel Fernández]] in [[Panama City]] on 7 September 2013.&lt;ref name="Morgan Makes International Bow"&gt;{{cite news |title=Morgan Makes International Bow |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/070913-morgan-makes-international-bow-1040575.aspx |date=7 September 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan captained the ''Reggae Boyz'' for the first time in the 3–1 defeat to [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] on 9 September 2014.&lt;ref name="Wes Morgan to captain Boyz against Canada today"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wes Morgan to captain Boyz against Canada today |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Wes-Morgan-to-captain-Boyz-against-Canada-today |date=9 September 2014 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan was part of the Jamaican squad invited to the [[2015 Copa América]] in Chile. He played every minute of their campaign, in which they were eliminated in last place in [[2015 Copa América Group B|their group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentina 1–0 Jamaica |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33085643 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, he was again an undisputed part of their team at the [[2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] in the United States and Canada, helping them to a first [[2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final|final]], which was lost 3–1 to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamaica 1–3 Mexico |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33670944 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Grant Evans''' (born 3 January 1988) is a Northern Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for {{English football updater|LeicestC}} club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]].

Evans was born in [[Belfast]] and started his career at Greenisland FC, where he was spotted by Manchester United scouts. He progressed through [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United's football Academy]] to play in several foreign tours in the summer of 2006. He then went on loan to [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] and had two spells with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He made his Manchester United first team debut in the [[2007–08 Football League Cup|2007–08 League Cup]], becoming a regular first-team squad member the following season. Evans is the second most decorated player in Northern Irish football history with 10 major trophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/footbal-miscellany/decorated-footballers.htm |title=Most Decorated Irish Footballers |publisher=Soccer Ireland |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-news-evans-ferguson-12830488 |title=Former Manchester United defender lifts lid on Old Trafford exit |first=Ciaran |last=Kelly |date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Evans was scouted while playing for Greenisland FC, the same club that his brother [[Corry Evans|Corry]] and [[Craig Cathcart]] played for before moving to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article3075991.ece |title=Rising star, Jonny Evans, who signed up with dream club, Manchester United, as a 9-year-old |work=The Times |first=James |last=Ducker |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenislandboysfc.com/Roll%20of%20Honour.htm |title=Roll of Honour |publisher=Greenisland Boys F.C. |accessdate=6 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013160722/http://www.greenislandboysfc.com/Roll%20of%20Honour.htm |archivedate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nine, he was invited to attend the Manchester United Centre of Excellence in [[Belfast]], before being invited for a trial in Manchester a year later. Rule changes within [[The Football Association]] at the time meant that clubs were limited to players who lived within an hour and a half of the club, so Evans' opportunities were limited. However, the Evans family soon relocated to Manchester, allowing Jonny to train with Manchester United full-time. Evans progressed through Manchester United's Academy, featuring in two of the club's three games during the 2006 summer tour of South Africa, as well as domestic friendlies against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. Evans also made a surprise appearance in the [[Amsterdam Tournament]] against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. Evans spent the first half of the [[2006–07 in Belgian football|2006–07 season]] on loan at Manchester United's Belgian feeder club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], alongside fellow youngsters [[Darron Gibson]], [[Danny Simpson]] and [[Fraizer Campbell]].

===Sunderland loans===
In December 2006, Evans agreed to join [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on loan until the end of the 2006–07 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6217433.stm |title=Sunderland clinch Evans loan deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 December 2006 |accessdate=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Manchester United and Antwerp team-mate [[Danny Simpson]] joining on a similar deal in the January [[transfer window]]. The pair helped Sunderland clinch the [[Football League Championship]] title, with Evans winning the club's "Youth Player of the Year" award at the end of the season. Although manager [[Roy Keane]] was hopeful of re-signing Evans on loan following promotion to the [[Premier League]], it was confirmed in June 2007 that Evans would be staying at Manchester United to push for a place in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6726865.stm |title=Evans delivers Sunderland blow |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2008, Evans rejoined Sunderland on loan for the second time, and was immediately drafted into the first team squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7171301.stm |title=Evans heads to Sunderland on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans played the full 90 minutes in his first game, losing 3–0 to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[FA Cup]]. Evans was criticised for granting Wigan the second goal of the game, for which he lost the ball on the edge of his own box, resulting in a deflected own goal by [[Paul McShane (footballer)|Paul McShane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7163974.stm |title=Sunderland 0–3 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 January 2008 |accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His half-season with Sunderland was generally successful, however, and the team avoided relegation.

===Return to Manchester United===
[[File:Jonny Evans.JPG|thumb|upright|Evans in 2009]]

Evans made his Manchester United debut on 26 September 2007 against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the [[Football League Cup]]. Unfortunately, his debut ended in a 2–0 defeat. He then appeared as a late substitute for [[Gerard Piqué]] in a [[UEFA Champions League]] match at home to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] on 7 November 2007 to secure Manchester United's qualification to the knockout stage of the competition. He subsequently made his first Champions League start on 12 December 2007 against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]].

Evans made his league debut for United against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 21 September 2008, filling in for [[Nemanja Vidić]] who was unavailable due to suspension. The game ended 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7613923.stm |title=Chelsea 1–1 Man Utd |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Evans made two substitute appearances for Manchester United at the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup|FIFA Club World Cup]], including one in the final after Nemanja Vidić was sent off shortly after half time. Evans continued to deputise throughout the rest of the season, appearing in a number of league games and in the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]].

At the beginning of the 2010–11 football season, Evans became a regular fixture in the United team, partnering Nemanja Vidić in the centre of defence in the absence of the injured [[Rio Ferdinand]]. On 19 March 2011, Evans injured [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and United States international [[Stuart Holden]] with a tackle which left Holden out for six months which eventually got worse and caused him to be slidelined for 22 months. Despite Evans being given a straight red card for the tackle, Manchester United went on to win the game 1–0 with a [[Dimitar Berbatov]] goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/21/bolton-stuart-holden-out-six-months |title=Bolton's Stuart Holden out for six months after Jonny Evans tackle |location=London |work=The Guardian |date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the [[2011–12 Manchester United F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Evans was handed the number 6 shirt after [[Wes Brown]] was transferred to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Aug/evans-on-northern-ireland.aspx |title=Evans feeling positive |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August, he wore his new shirt number for the first time in United's opening day 2–1 win at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], he came on for the injured [[Nemanja Vidić]] in the 52nd minute at [[The Hawthorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14435075 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=West Brom 1–2 Man Utd |date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October, he was sent off in United's 6–1 defeat against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] after bringing down [[Mario Balotelli]] in a last-man challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15325536 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Man Utd 1–6 Man City |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans made his 100th appearance for the ''Red Devils'' on 30 November, playing the full 120 minutes as United lost 2–1 to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] [[2011–12 Football League Cup#Fifth round|quarter-final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15850177 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Man Utd 1–2 Crystal Palace (AET) |date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2012, he scored his first goal for United after opening the scoring in the 5–0 league win at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17330272 |title=Wolves 0–5 Man United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans missed the final three games of the season with a foot injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4501994/Jonny-Evans-is-set-to-come-to-the-rescue-of-Manchester-Uniteds-ailing-back-four-tomorrow.html |title=Evans help us |newspaper=The Sun |first=Neil |last=Custis |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Having undergone surgery to repair an ankle injury at the end of last season, Evans was unable to start pre-season training until early August, but there was speculation that he might be playing [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s second game against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ogden |first=Mark |title=Papers: Evans back for Fulham? |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/What-The-Papers-Say/2012/Aug/papers-jonny-evans-to-return-for-fulham-game.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans scored his second goal for the club in a 3–0 away win at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 7 October 2012, thumping home a header from a [[Robin van Persie]] corner kick. On 23 October, Evans scored his first goal in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and first at [[Old Trafford]] in a 3–2 victory over [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. He scored the equalising goal at 2–2, scrambling home from a corner kick. Evans netted his third goal of the season on 24 November 2012 in a 3–1 win, heading in the equaliser against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at Old Trafford from a corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jurejko |first=Jonathan |title=Man Utd 3–1 QPR |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20374677 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2012, Evans signed a new contract with United which will keep him at the club until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Dec/Jonny-Evans-signs-new-Manchester-United-deal-until-June-2016.aspx |title=New deal for Evans |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans scored his third league goal of the season and fourth overall on [[Boxing Day]] in a 4–3 win against [[Newcastle United]], tapping home after [[Javier Hernández|Javier Hernandez]]'s shot had been saved by [[Tim Krul]].

====2014–15 season====
On 4 March 2015, Evans was involved in a suspicious spitting altercation with [[Papiss Cissé]] in a 1–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He denied the ensuing charge from the FA and said: "I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. Having woken up this morning, I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match." However he was still banned for 6 games on 7 March, Papiss Cissé for seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31773054 |title=Jonny Evans banned for six games, Papiss Cisse for seven |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2015 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Bromwich Albion=== 
====2015–16 season====

Evans signed for Premier League club West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee on 29 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jonny Evans: West Brom seal deal for Man Utd for defender |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34090952 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;He made his debut for the club on 12 September 2015 in a 0–0 draw against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34160768 |title=West Bromwich Albion 0–0 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2015 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2016, Evans scored his first West Brom goal in a 2–1 victory over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35180343 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–1 Stoke City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 2016, before the final game of the season, Evans received Players'Player of the Season award of West Bromwich Albion on his primary campaign for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2016/may/albion-announce-end-of-season-awards-winners/ |title=Albion announce end-of-season awards winners |publisher=West Brom Official Site |date=15 May 2016 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

====2016–17 season====

He had to wait a long time for his next goal, which came in a 3–1 win over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 3 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38113785 |title=West Bromwich Albion 3–1 Watford |date=3 December 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next goal came in a 2–1 loss against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea]] on the final game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39912021 |title=Swansea City 2–1 West Bromwich Albion |date=21 May 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====

In July 2017, following the departure of club skipper [[Darren Fletcher]] to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Skipper leaves Albion |url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2017/june/skipper-leaves-albion/ |date=1 June 2017|access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans was confirmed permanent captaincy by head coach [[Tony Pulis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pulis confirms Evans captaincy – and insists he is going nowhere |url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2017/july/pulis-confirms-evans-captaincy/ |date=18 July 2017|access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal of the season on 30 September 2017 in a 2–2 draw against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], an alike header of the one he scored ten months earlier against the same opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41370359 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–2 Watford |date=30 September 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal of the season was against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] at home on 13 January 2018, which brought his side's first league win across 5 months and 20 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42587982 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion |date=13 January 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leicester City===

In June 2018, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] activated his relegation release clause in his contract with West Bromwich Albion with £3.5m. He signed a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Jonny Evans: Leicester sign West Brom &amp; Northern Ireland defender |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 June 2018 |accessdate=8 June 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44411174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his Leicester debut in a 2–0 victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 18 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Leicester 2–0 Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45153216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Despite having not yet made his senior debut for Manchester United, Evans was called up to the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] squad for the first time in September 2006, making his debut in the memorable 3–2 victory over [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/5321964.stm |title=Northern Ireland 3–2 Spain |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans has since retained his place in the squad and has made over 60 appearances. On 28 March 2009, Evans scored his first international goal in a 3–2 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)]], volleyed home from close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7970206.stm |title=Northern Ireland 3–2 Poland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2009 |accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

On 28 May 2016, Evans was included in Northern Ireland's final 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] by national team manager [[Michael O'Neill (footballer)|Michael O'Neill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euro 2016: NI boss O'Neill names final 23-man squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36405294 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 May 2016 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time Northern Ireland had ever been involved in the finals of the competition, and their first major tournament since the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. Northern Ireland eventually reached the last 16, being knocked out by [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in a 1–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36566171 |title=Wales 1–0 Northern Ireland |date=25 June 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans participated in all four games Northern Ireland played in this tournament.&lt;br /&gt;

His second international goal came 8 years after the first one on 4 September 2017, scoring a backward header against [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. The game finished a 2–0 victory to his side and consolidated their good form in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)]]. Northern Ireland reached the playoff stage of the qualification,seeing the best chance of returning to the competition for the first time in 32-year. However in the first leg they suffered from a controversial penalty decision made by Romanian referee [[Ovidiu Hategan]], he deems Evans' young brother [[Corry Evans|Corry]] handled the ball and booked him for that so he would miss the second leg, where the ball clearly struck Corry's shoulder. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill claimed it was the worst decision he had ever seen in a game he had been involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41840566 |title=Northern Ireland 0–1 Switzerland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2017 |accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ended as a 1–0 defeat to them and a goalless draw in the second leg three days later means they were officially knocked out of the competition. Evans nearly equalized the aggregate score in the injury time where his header already beat Switzerland goalkeeper [[Yann Sommer]], but was cleared off the line by defender [[Ricardo Rodríguez (footballer)|Ricardo Rodriguez]], who converted that controversial penalty in the first leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41874404 |title=Switzerland 0–0 Northern Ireland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2017 |accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans scored his third goal at senior international level when he opened the scoring against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in Northern Ireland's second game of the [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group C|qualification]] phase for [[UEFA Euro 2020]].

On 19 December 2007, Evans was arrested in connection to an alleged rape that occurred at the hotel where Manchester United's Christmas party was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7151624.stm |title=Man Utd star bailed in rape probe |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 2008, it was reported that Evans would not be prosecuted for any offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL141856920080314 |title=Man United defender Evans won't face rape charges |agency=Reuters |date=14 March 2008 |first=Peter |last=Griffiths |accessdate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demarai Remelle Gray''' (born 28 June 1996) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|LeicestC}} club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

Gray came through the youth system of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], for whom he made his [[English Football League|Football League]] debut as a 17-year-old in October 2013. In two-and-a-half seasons, he made 78 appearances across all competitions, including 51 starts in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and scored 8 goals.

He has represented England from [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] to [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level.

==Club career==
===Birmingham City===
====Early life and career====
Gray was born in [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref name=Hugman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hugmansfootballers.com/player/26151 |title=Demarai Gray |website=Barry Hugman's Footballers |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Frankley Community High School|Frankley High School]] and played for [[Cadbury Athletic]]'s junior teams. He joined [[Birmingham City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Birmingham City's Academy]] as an under-11,&lt;ref name=BlueKid/&gt; and took up a two-year scholarship in July 2012.&lt;ref name=FAscholar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/2FC380172F88401482C3994AF130D59B.ashx |format=PDF |title=List of Players Registered as Scholars in Accordance with Rule C.3 Between 01/07/2012 and 31/07/2012 |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, Gray assessed his strengths as "pace, dribbling and technique", felt he needed to "score more goals", described himself in three words as "bubbly, calm and happy", and named [[Nathan Redmond]] as the biggest influence on him since joining the club.&lt;ref name=BlueKid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20131002-blue-kid-on-the-block-demarai-gray-1091374.aspx |title=Blue kid on the block&amp;nbsp;– Demarai Gray |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213643/http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20131002-blue-kid-on-the-block-demarai-gray-1091374.aspx |archivedate=4 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After impressing Birmingham manager [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]] in training, he was named in the squad for the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 1 October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lee Clark: Demarai Gray is in the squad. He was superb in training on Monday |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-lee-clark-tells-6118328 |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his senior debut as a 91st-minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Jesse Lingard]] in a 4–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Birmingham 4–0 Millwall |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24246482 |first=Ged |last=Scott |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start on 2 November, in a 1–0 league defeat at home to [[Charlton Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/birmingham-city-0-charlton-athletic-6267952 |title=Birmingham City 0 Charlton Athletic 1 |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=4 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray signed his first professional contract, of two-and-a-half years, on 9 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25306246 |title=Birmingham City: Demarai Gray signs two-and-a-half-year pro deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days after his inclusion together with academy teammate [[Reece Brown (footballer, born 1996)|Reece Brown]] in a "Top 10 Football League stars of tomorrow" feature on the ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/top-10-football-league-stars-tomorrow |title=The Top 10 Football League stars of tomorrow |first=Joel |last=Goldman |website=FourFourTwo |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray scored his first senior goal. Entering the League match at home to [[Blackburn Rovers]] on 19 April 2014 as a second-half substitute with Birmingham 4–1 down, he received a pass from [[Federico Macheda]] and shot low into the corner to score the final goal of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/birmingham-city-2-blackburn-4-7003317 |title=Birmingham City 2 Blackburn 4 |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=19 April 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance over the season earned him the Academy Player of the Season award for 2013–14.&lt;ref name=AcademyPotY&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20140504-robbos-double-delight-at-pa14-1528018.aspx |title=Robbo's double delight at #PA14 |first=Andy |last=Walker |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506150908/http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20140504-robbos-double-delight-at-pa14-1528018.aspx |archivedate=6 May 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regular first-team football====
Gray performed well in 2014–15 pre-season, and the management suggested he was showing increased maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-demarai-gray-keen-7562121 |title=Teen star Demarai Gray keen to keep up pre-season form |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=5 August 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the first two matches of the season, but for the remainder of Clark's tenure as manager, Gray was used more as substitute than starter.&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt; Against [[Leeds United]] in September, he was denied a penalty and booked for [[diving (association football)|diving]] when apparently fouled by [[Giuseppe Bellusci]]; both managers thought it the wrong decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-demarai-gray-not-7767162 |title=Birmingham City: Demarai Gray is not a diver says Lee Clark as Blues boss hits out at the penalty that wasn't given |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 September 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, his first goal of the season gave Birmingham a 2–0 lead at top-of-the-table [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but he became unwell in the second half. Norwich scored while Birmingham were attempting to substitute him, and the match ended 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29186835 |title=Norwich 2–2 Birmingham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demarai Gray August 2014.png|thumb|upright|Gray playing for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2014]]

He made his first start under new manager [[Gary Rowett]] in the 1–0 win away to [[Rotherham United]] on 22 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/rotherham-united-0-birmingham-city-8156217 |title=Rotherham United 0 Birmingham City 1 |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=22 November 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon established himself as the left-sided wide midfielder in a [[4-2-3-1|4–2–3–1]] formation as Rowett regularly named an unchanged starting eleven.&lt;ref name=FLPotM/&gt; On his tenth league start, Gray scored three times in the first half of the match at home to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 14 December, which ended 6–1. It was his first [[hat-trick (association football)|hat-trick]] since his under-14 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30356696 |title=Birmingham 6–1 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClubsLinked&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-demarai-gray-ignores-8288030 |title=Birmingham City's Demarai Gray ignores speculation linking him with Newcastle, Liverpool and Spurs |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rowett praised not only his clinical finishing but also his work off the ball and tracking back to cover in defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/clinical-demarai-gray-delights-birmingham-8284723 |title=Clinical Demarai Gray delights Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances during December earned him the [[Football League Young Player of the Month]] award.&lt;ref name=FLPotM&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30902270 |title=Demarai Gray: Birmingham City teenager unaffected by speculation |first=Ged |last=Scott |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark had expressed concern that the club's financial difficulties would force the sale of players such as Gray,&lt;ref name=PalaceBid&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-lee-clark-worried-7968942 |title=Lee Clark worried over Blues losing Koby Arthur and Demarai Gray |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=20 October 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the player was offered a two-year contract extension.&lt;ref name=DealDec14&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11694/9609527/sky-bet-championship-birmingham-offer-demarai-gray-a-two-year-contract-extension |title=Birmingham offer Demarai Gray a two-year contract extension |publisher=Sky Sports |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A £500,000 bid from [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] was rejected in September,&lt;ref name=PalaceBid/&gt; [[scout (sport)|scouts]] regularly watched the player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-demarai-gray-not-8464166 |title=Demarai Gray not affected by rumours, says Gary Rowett |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=8 January 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and media reports linked him with clubs including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Newcastle United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref name=ClubsLinked/&gt; The club turned down a series of offers, the highest reported as £5&amp;nbsp;million, from Championship club [[AFC Bournemouth]] in the January 2015 transfer window. In a statement issued when the window closed, they said that "none of [those offers] reflected the ability and potential of the player", and expressed their pleasure at having retained his services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-beaming-delight-after-8567727 |title=Birmingham City beaming with delight after holding on to prized asset Demarai Gray |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With loanee [[Lloyd Dyer]] available as an alternative, Rowett used Gray more sparingly, suggesting that his reduced effectiveness was a normal part of a young player's learning curve: the player needed to learn how to impose himself on a match despite increased attention from the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gary-rowett-birmingham-city-prospect-8820720 |title=Gary Rowett: Birmingham City prospect Demarai Gray has a first-team challenge |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Birmingham Mail'' suggested that Gray's potential as a matchwinner should not be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/demarai-gray-knack-impacting-game-8626668 |title=Demarai Gray has a knack of impacting the game from the bench and four other things we learned as Birmingham City went down at home to Millwall |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His solo goal on 11 April, in which he ran the length of the pitch to score the winner against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]], was his first since the Reading match and earned him the club's Goal of the Season award.&lt;ref name=Awards2015/&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "It was not so much the 18-year-old's pace that impressed as his persistence in running at and then pressurising Wolves full-back [[Scott Golbourne]] into error, and the certainty with which he then slid the ball past the Wolves goalkeeper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/11/birmingham-wolverhampton-wanderers-championship-match-report |title=Birmingham's Demarai Gray's stunning winner dents Wolves playoff hopes |first=Richard |last=Rae |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 April 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 43 appearances in all competitions, of which two-thirds were as a starter, and won the club's Young Player of the Season award.&lt;ref name=Awards2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/players-awards-2015-2438100.aspx |title=Donaldson completes hat-trick at the Players Awards 2015 |first=Jack |last=Burrell |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=3 May 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Departure becomes inevitable====
After many months of negotiation,&lt;ref name=DealDec14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-blues-ready-reward-8590674 |title=Blues are ready to reward Demarai Gray's exciting emergence with a bumper new deal |first=Mat |last=Kendrick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=6 February 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray signed a new three-year contract with the club in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Birmingham City: Demarai Gray agrees new deal |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33525877 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 July 2015 |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the player's insistence, a release clause was included in the terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/birmingham-city-transfer-news-gary-10678131 |title=Birmingham City transfer news: Gary Rowett reveals that Demarai Gray asked for release clause in the summer |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went into the new season feeling "stronger as a player, physically and mentally",&lt;ref name=Stronger&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-im-much-more-9752565 |title=I'm much more confident ahead of the new season, Demarai Gray warns |first=Paul |last=Suart |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced some fine performances, as in a 2–0 win at Leeds in October, when he took advantage of confusion in the defence to score what proved to be the only goal of his Birmingham season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/leeds-vs-birmham/339644 |title=Leeds 0–2 Birmingham: Demarai Gray shines in Blues' win |publisher=Sky Sports |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a goalless draw at [[Preston North End]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/comment-birmingham-city-flier-demarai-10608754 |title=Comment: Birmingham City flier Demarai Gray should be praised for what he does not lambasted for what he doesn't |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=16 December 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He nearly marked his last appearance for the club, as a substitute in a 2–0 win at home to Milton Keynes Dons on 29 December, with a farewell goal.

[[File:Manchester United v Leicester City, September 2016 (23).JPG|thumb|upright|Gray (front left) playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2016]]

[[Premier League]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] activated the release clause in Gray's contract, reported as £3.7&amp;nbsp;million, and he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract on 4 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35215306 |title=Leicester agree deal for Birmingham winger |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 10 January, away to [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in the third round of the FA Cup. He started the match, assisted a goal by [[Marcin Wasilewski]], and "showed glimpses of the pace that will cause Premier League defences problems" in the 2–2 draw at [[White Hart Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35216362 |title=Tottenham 2–2 Leicester |first=Andy |last=Cryer |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later he made his first appearance in England's top flight, as an 85th-minute substitute for [[Marc Albrighton]] in a 1–1 draw at [[Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35270643 |title=Aston Villa 1–1 Leicester |first=Tim |last=Peach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2016 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
====Early career====
Iheanacho was born in the state of [[Imo State|Imo]].&lt;ref name=BDFutbol/&gt; As a youth, he represented Taye Academy in [[Owerri]], the capital city of Imo. His performances for Nigeria in the [[2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] led to interest from clubs in Europe; teams following his progress included [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arsenal-iheanacho-nigeria-world-cup-wenger-rowley-521299 |title=Nigeria win Under-17 World Cup |work=International Business Times |author=Adrian Back |date=11 November 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[FC Porto|Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://talksport.com/football/man-city-set-miss-out-nigerian-wonderkid-13123173775 |title=Man City set to miss out on Nigerian wonderkid |work=Talksport |date=31 December 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Iheanacho travelled to England to discuss a move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He signed a pre-contract agreement with the club, stating his intent to formally sign for City on his 18th birthday in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11679/9109769/transfer-news-manchester-city-deal-for-kelechi-iheanacho-claimed |title=Transfer news: Manchester City deal for Kelechi Iheanacho claimed |work=Sky Sports |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, he returned to Nigeria. As the year drew to a close, the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) named him the Most Promising Talent of the Year for 2013 at the [[CAF Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafonline.com/en-US/NewsCenter/News/NewsDetails?id=%2FR3WaZKROVJ6wGZ8srjnDQ%3D%3D |title=Iheanacho named most promising talent |work=Confederation of African Football |date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iheanacho joined [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester City's Academy]] on 10 January 2014. Before the [[2014–15 Manchester City F.C. season|2014–15 season]], City visited the United States on a pre-season tour, and although still not formally a City player, he joined up with the squad. He played and scored in the first match of the tour, a 4–1 win against [[Sporting Kansas City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-city-profile-kelechi-iheanacho-7510799 |title=City profile: Kelechi Iheanacho |work=Manchester Evening News |author=Paul Handler |date=26 July 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored again against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in a 5–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/jovetic-strikes-twice-nigerias-kelechi-iheanacho-nets-and-man-city-thump-ac-milan |title=Jovetic strikes twice, Nigeria's Kelechi Iheanacho nets and Man City thump AC Milan |work=The National |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conclusion of the tour, Manchester City arranged for Iheanacho to train with the [[Columbus Crew]] until mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/covering-the-crew/2014/09/man-city.html |title=Young Manchester City Striker Kelechi Iheanacho Training With Crew |work=Columbus Dispatch |author=Adam Jardy |date=3 September 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delays in obtaining a work permit meant Iheanacho was unable to play in England until February 2015. He made his debut at under-19 level in a [[UEFA Youth League]] match against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], but sustained an injury after only 11 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sl10.ng/news/articles/Category/nigeria-players-abroad/manchester-city-striker-kelechi-iheanacho-starts-individual-training-after-injury-lay-off/206755 |title=Manchester City Striker Kelechi Iheanacho Starts Individual Training |work=SL10 |date=14 April 2015 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his recovery, he began to represent Manchester City at both youth and under-21 level in the latter part of the season. He played in the [[FA Youth Cup]] final, where he scored, but ended on the losing side after [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] claimed a 5–2 aggregate victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/27/chelsea-fa-youth-cup-manchester-city |title=Chelsea retain FA Youth Cup with victory against Manchester City |work=The Guardian |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, he scored the only goal as Manchester City beat Porto in the final of the [[2014–15 Premier League International Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Match-reports/2015/May/City-EDS-v-Porto-International-Premier-League-Cup-final-match-report-5167 |title=Manchester City EDS v Porto: International Premier League Cup match report |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
In July 2015, Iheanacho was included in City's pre-season tour team in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Tour-2015/2015/Official-Manchester-City-Tour-2015-squad-list/1436520345 |title=Man City News – Manchester City FC Transfers, Injury Updates, Match reports and Interviews |publisher=Manchester City F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the tour, he set up the first goal for [[Raheem Sterling]] and scored the second goal in the win against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in the [[2015 International Champions Cup]]. He also set up Sterling for the fourth goal in City's 8–1 victory against the [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam national team]]. In City's last preseason game, against [[VfB Stuttgart]], he came on as a substitute, scoring late on in a 4–2 defeat. Due to his impressive pre-season, Iheanacho was promoted to the Manchester City senior squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Roma vs. Manchester City – 21 July 2015 – Soccerway |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/07/21/world/international-champions-cup/as-roma/manchester-city-football-club/2032769/ |work=Soccerway |publisher=Perform Group |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2015, Iheanacho was included in a first-team matchday squad for the first time in a competitive fixture, however he remained an unused substitute in their 3–0 win at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in their first game of the [[Premier League]] [[2015–16 Premier League|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanghera |first1=Mandeep |title=West Brom 0–3 Man City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33754829 |accessdate=26 August 2015 |date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen days later, he made his competitive debut, replacing Raheem Sterling for the final minute of a 2–0 win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |title=Man City 2–0 Watford |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34025307 |accessdate=29 August 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first competitive goal on 12 September, replacing [[Wilfried Bony]] in the final minute in a match away to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and scoring the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cryer |first1=Andy |title=Crystal Palace 0–1 Man City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34160754 |accessdate=12 September 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iheanacho scored his first career hat-trick on 30 January 2016 against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the fourth round of the [[FA Cup]], also setting up City's fourth goal, scored by Raheem Sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35389138 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Aston Villa 0–4 Man City |date=30 January 2016 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he was put in City's [[UEFA Champions League]] squad at the expense of the injured [[Samir Nasri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radamel Falcao: Chelsea striker dropped from Champions League squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35488481 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During February, Iheanacho scored against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 2–1 home defeat for City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City 1–2 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35515153 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iheanacho's next goals came on 23 April 2016, where he scored twice against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City 4–0 Stoke City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36061069 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with a Champions League semi-final substitute appearance on 26 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City 0–0 Real Madrid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36125922 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, on 1 May 2016, he scored two again, albeit in a 4–2 defeat at the hands of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southampton 4–2 Manchester City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36122770 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====
On 10 September 2016, Iheanacho started in the [[Manchester derby]]. He recorded an assist and his first goal of the season in a 2–1 win for City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supersport.com/football/nigeria/news/160911/Iheanacho_pleased_with_derby_heroics |title=Iheanacho pleased with derby heroics |publisher=supersport.com |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Iheanacho came off the bench to score the final goal in City's 4–0 home win in the Champions League, against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37331231 |title=Manchester City 4–0 B M'gladbach |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first European goal for Manchester City.

Bournemouth|Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37325835 |title=Manchester City 4–0 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That goal took his tally in the Premier League to 10, allowing him to join an exclusive list of players to have scored 10 Premier League goals before the age of 20. This list includes players such as [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Nicolas Anelka]], [[Michael Owen]] and [[Romelu Lukaku]].&lt;ref name="goal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/106112 |title=Iheanacho joins select teenage club|access-date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016, Iheanacho was nominated for the [[FIFA]] Golden Boy award, which was eventually won by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]'s midfielder [[Renato Sanches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Previous winners of the award include teammates [[Raheem Sterling]] and [[Sergio Agüero]], and five-time [[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[Lionel Messi]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Vardy made his tournament debut on 16 June, in England's second group match at UEFA Euro 2016, coming off the bench in the second half to score an equalising goal against [[Wales national football team|Wales]], helping his team come from behind to win the match 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/16/england-2-wales-1-daniel-sturridge-and-jamie-vardy-come-off-the/ |title=England 2 Wales 1: Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Vardy come off the bench to secure last-gasp win |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tournament, there were media rumours of a feud between Vardy and fellow striker Rooney, which were denied by manager [[Roy Hodgson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crellin |first1=Mark |title=Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy are close friends, says Roy Hodgson |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/10325817/wayne-rooney-and-jamie-vardy-are-close-friends-says-roy-hodgson |accessdate=28 June 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named in the 23-man England squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44138600 |title=England World Cup squad: Trent Alexander-Arnold in 23-man squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2018, Vardy "stepped aside" from the England national team, telling manager [[Gareth Southgate]] that he did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45332294 |title=Jamie Vardy and Gary Cahill step aside from international football |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=28 August 2018 |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
[[Ian Wright]], who also rose from non-League football to the Premier League and English national team, wrote in October 2015 that Vardy could be England's equivalent to [[Salvatore Schillaci]] at UEFA Euro 2016: Schillaci, another late bloomer, began the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] as a substitute behind more established players, and ended it as the top scorer.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Ian |title=Jamie Vardy can be England's Toto Schillaci at Euro 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34611895 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, who first learnt of Vardy when his former Burnley teammate [[Micky Mellon]] signed him for Fleetwood, rates Vardy as a hard-working player with a good first touch, who creates constant work for defenders, and plays by instinct instead of being moulded by his managers.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; Although he usually plays in a central role as a striker, he is a versatile player, who is capable of playing in several attacking positions, and has also been used as a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]].&lt;ref name="dai dilettanti all'Inghilterra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2015/10/09-4805058/vardy_dai_dilettanti_alla_maglia_dell_inghilterra |title=Vardy, dai dilettanti alla maglia dell'Inghilterra |newspaper=Corriere dello Sport |language=Italian |author1=Chioffi, Stefano |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his goalscoring, Vardy is known for his high work-rate, relentless running, and direct approach, and is also capable of creating chances for his teammates.&lt;ref name="Vardy scales new heights"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/21/leicester-jamie-vardy-england |title=Leicester's Jamie Vardy scales new heights with England call-up |date=21 May 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an extremely fast and dynamic striker, with good positioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2015/11/30/how-little-known-jamie-vardy-became-a-goal-scoring-beast/ |title=How little-known Jamie Vardy became a goal-scoring beast |newspaper=The New York Post |author1=Hood, Bryan |date=30 November 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an excellent sense of space in the area;&lt;ref name="real deal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/03/23/players-of-the-season-why-jamie-vardy-is-the-real-deal/ |title=Players of the season: Why Jamie Vardy is the real deal |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=JJ |last=Bull |date=26 March 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is also known for his ability to play on the last defender's shoulder, time his runs to beat the defensive line, and stretch opponents,&lt;ref name="Vardy scales new heights"/&gt; which, combined with his pace, makes him a threat on counter-attacks.&lt;ref name="dai dilettanti all'Inghilterra"/&gt; A composed finisher and an accurate [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taker, he is also good in the air, and capable of striking the ball powerfully with both feet.&lt;ref name="real deal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/30385/10037779/jamie-vardy-is-the-premier-league-top-scorer-can-he-keep-it-up |title=Jamie Vardy is the Premier League top scorer: Can he keep it up? |publisher=Sky Sports |author1=Bate, Adam |date=22 October 2015 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; England coach and [[Sky Sports]] pundit [[Gary Neville]] commented on how Vardy's approach influences teammates: "He sets the tempo and the tone for the rest of the team and gives no other player behind him any excuse for not working hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/614359/Manchester-United-Gary-Neville-hails-Jamie-Vardy-England-great |title=Manchester United legend hails Jamie Vardy as one of the great England forwards |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |author1=Mafham, Colin |date=25 October 2015 |accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Vardy drank heavily every night during his early days at the club, and would turn up at training still intoxicated. Srivaddhanaprabha discussed with Vardy over what he expected in his life, and Vardy gave up drinking and took training more seriously from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sheen |first1=Tom |title=Jamie Vardy used to 'turn up drunk', claims Leicester vice-chairman |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jamie-vardy-used-to-turn-up-drunk-claims-leicester-vice-chairman-a7014666.html |accessdate=6 May 2016 |newspaper=The Independent |date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Vardy spoke to the media about his unusual lifestyle choices for a professional sportsperson. He said that he does not exercise in a gym, and that he consumes [[Red Bull]] caffeinated beverages and [[snus]] smokeless tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=Tom |title=Jamie Vardy's gym workout revealed: lifting a can of Red Bull and sucking tobacco |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/18/jamie-vardys-gym-workout-revealed-lifting-a-can-of-red-bull-and1/ |accessdate=25 November 2017 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Jamie Vardy: England staff have no problem with him using nicotine pouches |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36568105 |accessdate=25 November 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Before turning professional, Vardy combined playing non-League football with a job as technician making medical [[Splint (medicine)|splints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Our Jamie has come so Var |first=Stuart |last=Hammond |newspaper=The Non-League Paper |page=7 |date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he received a conviction for assault following an incident outside a pub, and had to play with an electronic tag fitted for six months, while his curfew also limited his playing time at Stocksbridge Park Steels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brooks |first1=Gideon |title=Exclusive: Jamie Vardy's former chairman reveals how assault conviction changed career |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/622586/Jamie-Vardy-Leicester-assault-conviction-Premier-League |accessdate=29 November 2015 |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |date=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, ''The Sun on Sunday'' published a video of Vardy at a casino the previous month, calling a man of East Asian origin a "[[Jap]]". He apologised for a "regrettable error of judgement" and was fined by Leicester, who put him on an educational course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City fine Jamie Vardy over racist incident |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2015/0813/721096-leicester-fine-jamie-vardy-over-racist/ |accessdate=2 September 2015 |publisher=RTÉ Sport |date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Vardy launched V9 Academy, an annual week-long camp designed to offer coaching and guidance to 60 non-League players and offer them the opportunity to showcase their talent in front of scouts from league clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34950055 |title=Jamie Vardy: Leicester striker launches non-league academy |date=27 November 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/27/jamie-vardy-leicester-academy-non-league |title=Leicester's Jamie Vardy sets up academy to help non-league talent |date=27 November 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Stocksbridge Park Steels named their main stand after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Joe |title=Jamie Vardy's first club Stocksbridge Park Steels to name main stand after Leicester's record-breaking goal-scorer |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3337989/Jamie-Vardy-s-club-Stocksbridge-Park-Steels-main-stand-Leicester-s-record-breaking-goal-scorer.html |accessdate=29 November 2015 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=29 November 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the [[Leicester]]-based food manufacturer [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]] brought out a limited edition 'Vardy Salted' [[Potato chip|crisp]] flavour, in recognition of Vardy's goalscoring run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Sean |title=Jamie Vardy gets his own limited edition Walkers crisp flavour |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city/12046867/Jamie-Vardy-gets-his-own-limited-edition-Walkers-crisp-flavour.html |accessdate=12 December 2015 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Butchart]], British writer of the [[Goal!

After impressing in the under-18 squad and playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.

During the [[2009–10 Aston Villa F.C. season#Friendly Matches|2009–10 pre-season]], Albrighton was included in the squad which played in the pre-season friendly tournament, the [[2009 Peace Cup]], in which he scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win over [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2200/peace-cup-2009/2009/07/29/1411193/aston-villa-see-off-atlante-to-progress-in-peace-cup |title=Aston Villa See Off Atlante To Progress in Peace Cup |work=[[Goal]] |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the Peace Cup final in which Villa beat Italians [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] 4–3 in a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/03/villa-peace-cup-juventus |title=Aston Villa win Peace Cup after beating Juventus |work=The Guardian |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First team====
Albrighton made his [[Premier League]] debut on 15 August 2009, the opening day of the 2009–10 season against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at [[Villa Park]], coming on as a 68th-minute substitute for [[Habib Beye]] in a 0–2 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3149182,00.html |title=Aston Villa 0–2 Wigan: Match Facts |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=15 August 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, he extended his contract with Villa by three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/5580686 |title=Albrighton signs new Villa deal |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, manager [[Martin O'Neill]] admitted that Albrighton along with fellow youngsters [[Nathan Delfouneso]] and [[Ciaran Clark]] were the subject of many loan offers, but went on to state his belief that the trio were good enough to learn their trade in the fringes of the Aston Villa side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2096821,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307013237/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2096821,00.html |archivedate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albrighton then set up both goals for the home side in the 2–1 defeat of local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] in December 2010.

On 21 December 2011, he scored the Premier League's 20,000th goal at home against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], winning a £20,000 cheque from league sponsors [[Barclays]], donated to his chosen charity, [[Acorns Children's Hospice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/1397/98/albrighton-get-20000th-premier-league-goal-special |title=Football premier-league: Albrighton: To get 20,000th Premier League goal is special &amp;#124; Radio talkSPORT |publisher=Talksport.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] at the [[Memorial Ground]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16372066.stm "Bristol Rovers 1–3 Aston Villa"] BBC Sport. 7 January 2012.

A throat operation restricted Albrighton to a single outing, in the League Cup, up to October 2013. He joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on a 28-day loan on 30 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24743368 |title=Marc Albrighton: Aston Villa winger joins Wigan Athletic on loan |date=30 October 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four appearances for Wigan before returning to his parent club on 27 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aston Villa recall Marc Albrighton from loan spell at Wigan Athletic |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/9044867/ |work=Sky Sports |publisher=BSkyB |accessdate=28 November 2013 |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albrighton was released by Villa on 20 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Albrighton and Nathan Delfouneso released from Villa |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3845958,00.html |work=Aston Villa Official Website |date=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521114941/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3845958,00.html |archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leicester City===

====2014–15 season====
On 23 May 2014, Albrighton joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on a four-year contract, following their return to the Premier League for the first time in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City Seal Deal For Albrighton |date=23 May 2014 |publisher=[[Leicester City F.C.]] |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/230514-city-seal-deal-for-albrighton-1572247.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the Foxes on 23 August, replacing [[Riyad Mahrez]] for the final 22 minutes of a 2–0 loss at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. The following 29 April, in the reverse fixture at the [[King Power Stadium]], he scored his first Leicester goal, putting Leicester ahead just before half time in an eventual 3–1 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Leicester 1–3 Chelsea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32408264 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albrighton totalled 18 league appearances in his first season at his new club, adding a second goal in the last match of the season, a 5–1 win against [[Queens Park Rangers]] on 24 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five-star City end season in style |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-x-QPR-x-match-report/story-26563631-detail/story.html |accessdate=16 January 2016 |work=Leicester Mercury |date=24 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530033538/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-x-QPR-x-match-report/story-26563631-detail/story.html |archivedate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albrighton struggled to break into the first team squad at the start of the season, but nearer the end of the year was used as a wing-back by manager [[Nigel Pearson]] in a new formation that brought Leicester success. He played an instrumental role in helping complete Leicester's 'great escape' as the team won 7 out of their last 9 matches to finish 14th.

====2015–16 season====

On 14 September 2016, Albrighton scored the club's first ever [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] goal in a 3–0 win over [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] at the [[Jan Breydel Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Leicester's Marc Albrighton says Champions League goal will live with him forever"&gt;{{cite|title = Leicester's Marc Albrighton says Champions League goal will live with him forever|url = http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11712/10579303/leicesters-marc-albrighton-says-champions-league-goal-will-live-with-him-forever|publisher = Sky Sports|author = Nathan Orr|date = 15 September 2016|accessdate = 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Leicester player to score in a European competition since [[Muzzy Izzet]] against [[Red Star Belgrade]] in September 2000.&lt;ref name="Club Brugge 0-3 Leicester City"&gt;{{cite|title = Club Brugge 0–3 Leicester City|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37331303|publisher = BBC Sport|author = Patrick Jennings|date = 14 September 2016|accessdate = 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albrighton described the goal as "probably one of the greatest achievements of my career so far".&lt;ref name="Leicester's Marc Albrighton says Champions League goal will live with him forever"/&gt;

On 25 February 2017, reports emerged alleging that Albrighton was among several teammates who met with chairman [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha]] following their 2–1 Champions League defeat at Sevilla on 22 February,&lt;ref name="Sevilla 2-1 Leicester"&gt;{{cite|title = Sevilla 2–1 Leicester|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39043648|publisher = BBC Sport|author = Phil Dawkes|date = 22 February 2017|accessdate = 21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] being sacked.

'''Danny Ward''' (born {{birth date|df=yes|1980|6|15}}), also known by the [[nickname]] of '''"Wardy"''',&lt;ref name="Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrl.com/andrew-henderson-explains-left-london-successor-danny-ward|title=Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward|publisher=Total RL|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] in the [[Super League]], and an English former professional [[rugby league]] footballer who played in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. At international level, he played for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]], and at club level for the [[Leeds Rhinos]], [[Castleford Tigers]], [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[London Broncos#2006–2011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] in the [[Super League]].

Ward was previously [[Andrew Henderson (rugby league)|Andrew Henderson]]'s assistant coach at the [[London Broncos]], and had held this position since 2015. Prior to this, he was head coach of the Under-19s.

==Background==
Ward was born in [[Dewsbury]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

==Leeds Rhinos==
Ward is the son of former Leeds captain and coach [[David Ward (rugby league)|David Ward]]. He was signed for Leeds from Dewsbury Moor, and he made his début as a substitute against [[Sheffield Eagles]] in 1999. He was named the Leeds Alliance Player of the Year in 2000, before becoming a regular first team member the following season.

Ward first played at international level for the Great Britain Academy before being selected for [[John Kear]]'s England Under-21 squad for the tour of South Africa at the end of the 2001 season. England won the First Test 112–6 in the first test and the second 74–14. In 2002 he was selected in the England 'A' squad to play New Zealand at [[Griffin Park]], losing 12–34. He then was part of the squad to tour Fiji and Tonga. One of his highlights in 2002 was a [[Drop goal#Rugby league|drop goal]] in a victory at the Boulevard on his 21st birthday.

Ward emulated his father by playing in the [[Challenge Cup]] Final in 2003. In 2004 he made 14 first team starts and 12 substitute appearances, and scored a [[try]] in the 46–28 win over Wakefield. Ward played for the [[Leeds Rhinos]] at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2004 Super League Grand Final]] victory against the [[Bradford Bulls]]. In 2004 Ward made the transition into the senior Great Britain team making his début as a substitute against New Zealand in the Tri Nations competition.
[[Image:Danny Ward.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ward in action for Harlequins RL]]
As [[Super League IX]] champions, the Rhinos faced [[2004 NRL season]] premiers, the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]]. Ward played as a {{rlp|pr}} in Leeds' 39–32 victory. In his final season with Leeds, Ward scored a try in the [[2005 Challenge Cup]] Final against Hull and in the Grand Final qualifying win at St. Helens that took the Rhinos back to [[Old Trafford]] for the Grand Final. He played for the Rhinos at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2005 Super League Grand Final]] loss against [[Bradford Bulls]]. He left Leeds before the 2006 Super League season to join Castleford.

==Castleford Tigers==

At the beginning of the 2006's [[Super League XI]], Ward was released after an unsavoury incident. He joined the [[Castleford Tigers]], who had just been promoted from National League One. Ward adapted well to his new surroundings and one of his highlights that year was a try in the 31–30 victory over his former employers at the Jungle. However, his efforts were not enough to save Castleford from relegation.

==Hull Kingston Rovers==

For the 2007 season, he like [[Luke Dyer]], a teammate of his at Castleford, moved east to pastures new at Craven Park with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. So far, Ward has yet to make the impact that he did at both Leeds and Castleford, but his presence presents a danger to any defence in the whole of [[Super League]].

==Harlequins Rugby League==
He was released from Hull KR on 17 September 2007. He signed a two-year deal with [[London Broncos#Harlequins RL .282006.E2.80.932011.29|Harlequins]] starting from the 2008 season.&lt;ref name="Prop Ward secures Harlequins move"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/7012934.stm|title=Prop Ward secures Harlequins move|publisher=BBC|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Ward was the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] Under-19s for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was currently the assistant coach in 2015 and 2017.

He was promoted to head coach from the beginning of the 2018 season. Ward took charge of his first professional game with a 56-12 victory over the [[Barrow Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://londonbroncosrl.com/news/broncos-beat-barrow-with-storming-win-in-season-opener/ |title=Broncos beat Barrow with storming win in season opener|work=London Broncos|date=7 February 2018|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making only six appearances across all competitions at Hull, Maguire joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] of the Championship on a one-month loan deal on 10 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31359454 |title=Harry Maguire: Wigan Athletic sign Hull City defender on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2015 |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, he debuted in a 1–0 win at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maguire reflects on victorious debut |url=https://www.wiganathletic.com/news/2015/february/maguire-reflects-on-victorious-debut/ |accessdate=8 July 2018 |publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C. |date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February, he scored a header from [[Jermaine Pennant]]'s cross in a 3–1 win away to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackpool 1–3 Wigan Athletic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31562249 |accessdate=8 July 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having played as many games in his month-long loan as he had for Hull in the first half of the season, Maguire's stay at the [[DW Stadium]] was extended until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Maguire: Wigan extend Hull City defender's loan deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31869124 |accessdate=8 July 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Maguire was out on loan, Hull had been relegated to the Championship.

'''Eldin Jakupović''' ({{IPA-sh|jakǔːpoʋitɕ|bs}}; born 2 October 1984) is a Bosnian-born Swiss professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

He started his professional career at [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]] in 2004, then moved to [[FC Thun]] a year later. After success there, Jakupović joined [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] in March 2006. In September 2011, he joined [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]], and in 2012, he moved to Hull. In 2017, he left Hull City after their relegation back to the [[EFL Championship]] to join [[Premier League]] side, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

Having played at under-21 level for both Bosnia and Switzerland, he earned his only senior cap for the latter in 2008, and was part of their squad at [[UEFA Euro 2008]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Jakupović was born in [[Prijedor]], SFR Yugoslavia, present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He moved to [[Switzerland]] at a young age due to the [[Bosnian War]] and started his professional career at [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]] in 2004. He then moved to [[FC Thun]] in 2005. After a successful spell at FC Thun, Jakupović joined [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] in March 2006.

===Grasshopper===
Jakupović moved on a year-long [[loan (sports)|loan]] to Grasshopper on 30 August 2007. He scored a 94th-minute equaliser against [[BSC Young Boys]] in his third match for the club, earning Grasshopper a 3–3 draw. During the season Jakupović forced [[Fabio Coltorti]] to the bench as his backup. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Jakupović extended his loan at Grasshopper for another year, which meant new signing goalkeeper [[Massimo Colomba]] was benched.

===Lokomotiv return===
On 31 August 2009, Jakupović was confirmed as part of the Lokomotiv Moscow squad, with [[Ivan Pelizzoli]] leaving on loan to join [[U.C. AlbinoLeffe|AlbinoLeffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transfer news |url=http://www.eng.fclm.ru/?info-centr/news/8A24EBEEB1AF430C85617994A845CE1E/BA1B315FF3F144A483735B8B616EDC9C#news_BA1B315FF3F144A483735B8B616EDC9C |publisher=Lokomotiv Moscow |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005003503/http://eng.fclm.ru/?info-centr%2Fnews%2F8A24EBEEB1AF430C85617994A845CE1E%2FBA1B315FF3F144A483735B8B616EDC9C#news_BA1B315FF3F144A483735B8B616EDC9C |archivedate=5 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the number of foreigners in the Lokomotiv squad, Jakupović was asked to go out on loan again. In December, Jakupović went on trial at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and had a successful week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs set to land Swiss keeper Eldin Jakupovic on loan|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Spurs-set-to-land-Swiss-keeper-Eldin-Jakupovic-on-loan-article243121.html|publisher=The Mirror|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to various reasons a deal could not be completed with Lokomotiv Moscow. After a turbulent time with the Lokomotiv management, Jakupović was allowed to be released.

===Olympiakos Volou===
Jakupović had a fine season with [[Olympiakos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiakos Volou]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} After they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to the [[Delta Ethniki]], Jakupović left the team.

===Aris===
On 30 September 2011, Jakupović joined [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]], with three other ex-teammates, [[Noe Acosta]], [[Javier Umbides]] and [[Khalifa Sankare]]. He made his debut on 5 November 2011, against [[Olympiakos SFP]], which finished 2–3.

===Hull City===
On 20 March 2012, Jakupović joined English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on trial, and after impressing in training and a friendly match Hull manager [[Nick Barmby]] expressed a desire to sign Jakupović on a permanent contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tigers in Jakupovic talks|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11714/7620782/Tigers-in-Jakupovic-talks|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sacking of Nick Barmby, Jakupović had trials with Ipswich Town. On 9 July 2012, Jakupović signed for Hull City on a two-year contract, becoming [[Steve Bruce]]'s first full signing as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull agree keeper deal|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11714/7883832/Hull-agree-keeper-deal|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=Sky Sports|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~2836048,00.html |title=Tigers Complete Jakupovic Signing |date=9 July 2012 |work=The Tigers Official Website |publisher=Hull City A.F.C. |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711235940/http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10338~2836048%2C00.html |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially joined the team on their pre-season training session in Portugal. He made his debut in a 3–1 friendly win against [[North Ferriby United F.C.|North Ferriby United]] on 16 July 2012. His first Championship match for The Tigers came on 21 December 2012 at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], when he played in a 2–1 victory as Hull moved into second place in the Championship table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20723125| title = Derby 1–2 Hull| date = 21 December 2012| work = BBC Sport| publisher = BBC| accessdate = 8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by three more league appearances, all of which consisted of clean sheets.

Jakupović started for Hull against Arsenal in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round on 20 February 2016, at the [[Emirates Stadium]].

Jakupović has dual citizenship, both [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]], and has represented both at under-21 level.

He has played for Bosnia and Herzegovina U21 for two competitive matches,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/history/season=2006/round=1910/match=74413/report=lu.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/history/season=2006/round=1910/match=74414/report=lu.html&lt;/ref&gt; and a friendly match against [[Austria national under-21 football team|Austria U21]] for Switzerland on 1 March 2006.

In August 2005, Jakupović received his first call-up to the Bosnia and Herzegovina national squad which was a match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], however he did not accept the call up. In March 2007, Jakupović was asked again to play for the senior [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] against Norway, but declined the offer. Jakupović was included in the Swiss [[UEFA Euro 2008]] squad. He made his debut on 20 August 2008 in a friendly match against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]]. He was called up for the first two matches of [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=863881.html|title=Hitzfeld snubs unfit Senderos|agency=Reuters|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was an unused substitute.

In October 2008, Jakupović said that he would not play again for the Swiss national team due to family reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.football.ch/nm/de/Archiv_A-Team.aspx?vNews=1&amp;newsID=84|title=Djourou fällt aus|publisher=football.ch|date=13 October 2008|accessdate=1 July 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matthew Lee James''' (born 22 July 1991) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. His regular position is in [[midfielder|midfield]], but he can play in [[defender (association football)|defence]] when required. James began his career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where his brother [[Reece James (footballer, born 1993)|Reece]] also came through the youth ranks, but left the club for a spell on loan at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] before joining Leicester on a permanent basis in 2012.

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
Born in [[Bacup]], Lancashire, James joined the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United Academy]] at an early age, and made his first appearance for the under-18 side in October 2005, at the age of 14. His next appearance for the under-18s came just over a year later, when he came on as a substitute for [[Magnus Wolff Eikrem|Magnus Eikrem]] in a [[Premier Academy League]] fixture against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He made a further eight appearances for the under-18s during the 2006–07 season, before establishing himself as a regular in the team in 2007–08, although he began the season filling in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in defence. James scored his first goals in a Manchester United shirt during the 2007–08 season, both of them in the league. After making his first appearance for the reserve team in November 2007, James became a regular for the reserves during the 2008–09 season, while remaining a relative mainstay in the under-18 side. At the end of a season in which he had made 22 appearances for the reserves and 14 for the under-18s, James received his first call-up to the Manchester United senior team on 24 May 2009. Given the number 47 jersey, James was named on the bench for the match, but did not take to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Hull 0–1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048308.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=24 May 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James signed his first professional contract with Manchester United in July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Teen trio turn pro |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=6635556 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901163433/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BF9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114%7D&amp;newsid=6635556 |archive-date=1 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; before playing in the 1–0 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the final of the [[2008–09 Lancashire Senior Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Reserves: Bolton 0 Utd 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6637945 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212045639/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BB4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70%7D&amp;newsid=6637945 |archive-date=12 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the first team's match against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in the [[2009–10 Football League Cup#Fourth Round|Fourth Round of the League Cup]] on 27 October 2009, James was given a new squad number (43),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=Today at Old Trafford&amp;nbsp;– Tuesday 27 October&amp;nbsp; – 09:01 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={6DDFCB6E-3471-4E45-9385-F04D05F4A70D}&amp;newsid=6637707 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214164115/http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7B6DDFCB6E-3471-4E45-9385-F04D05F4A70D%7D&amp;newsid=6637707 |archive-date=14 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named as an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |title=Barnsley 0–2 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8323041.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preston North End (loan)===
In February 2010, James followed in the footsteps of Manchester United teammate [[Danny Welbeck]] by signing on loan with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] until the end of the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preston North End set to sign Man Utd's Matthew James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/8505108.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went straight into the Preston first-team for their match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 9 February 2010, and scored within 10 minutes as his deflected shot from outside the penalty area beat Sheffield United goalkeeper [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preston 2–1 Sheff Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8501344.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; James returned to Manchester United at the end of the 2009–10 season, but rejoined Preston on a season-long loan on 2 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United's Matthew James rejoins Preston |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/8783280.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2 July 2010 |date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2010, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] chose to recall [[Ritchie De Laet]], [[Joshua King (footballer)|Joshua King]] and James from their loans at Preston after the sacking of his son. De Laet and King returned immediately, but due to the terms of James' loan, he did not return to Manchester United until 4 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=James Returns To United |url=http://www.pnefc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10362~2257986,00.html |work=pnefc.net |publisher=Preston North End FC |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081645/http://www.pnefc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10362~2257986%2C00.html |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leicester City===

====2012–13 season====
On 15 May 2012, Matty James and his Manchester United teammate [[Richie De Laet]] moved to [[Leicester City F.C|Leicester City]] in a double transfer, for which the fee was undisclosed. The pair each signed three-year contracts.&lt;ref name="Agreement reached for United Duo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Agreement reached for United Duo |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2773743,00.html |publisher=Leicester City FC |work=LCFC.co.uk |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518112245/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2773743%2C00.html |archivedate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James, along with De Laet and [[Jamie Vardy]], made his competitive debut for Leicester against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]], scoring his first goal for the club (and Leicester's third of the night) as the Foxes ran out 4–0 winners in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie.&lt;ref name="Torquay 0-4 Leicester"&gt;{{cite web |title=Torquay 0–4 Leicester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19159882 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James added another 3 goals (all in the league) over the course of the season, including one in the 3–2 win against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on the final day of the season, helping Leicester to the final play-off position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nott'm Forest 2–3 Leicester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22320604 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; James started both legs of the eventual 3–2 aggregate defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the Championship [[2013 Football League play-offs|play-off semi final]].

====2013–14 season====
James found himself starting more games during the [[2013–14 Leicester City F.C. season|2013–14]] season, being in the line-up for Leicester's first 5 league games before being shown the first red card of his career in the 1–2 defeat to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], after being shown two yellow cards, a decision that left many perplexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlton 2 Leicester 1: Why did the ref send Matty James off? |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Charlton-2-Leicester-1-did-ref-send-Matty-James/story-19739158-detail/story.html |work=Leicester Mercury |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2014, James scored his only goal of the season, helping Leicester come from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with Watford. James played 35 times in the league as Leicester won promotion to the [[Premier League]], collecting the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] trophy along the way.

'''Nampalys Mendy''' (born 23 June 1992) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[defensive midfielder]] for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and is a former [[France national youth football team|French youth international]].

Due to his small stature, simple distribution, and reliable style of play, Mendy has been compared to former [[France national football team|French international]], [[Claude Makelele]]. Monaco club scout [[Didier Christophe]], for example, referred to Mendy as a "[[carbon copy]]" of Makelele.&lt;ref name=MendyFuture&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planete-asm.fr/actualite/6196-nampalys-mendy-un-petit-futur-grand.html |title=Nampalys Mendy, un petit futur grand |date=18 September 2010 |publisher=Planete ASM |language=French |accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
After leaving [[Sporting Toulon Var|Sporting Toulon]] in June 2007, Mendy went on trial with the football section of [[RC Toulonnais|RC Toulon]]. According to Monaco scout [[Didier Christophe]], the Toulon coaches stated that Mendy was there to "make up the numbers". However, while observing Mendy in training, Christophe noticed the player's intelligence and understanding of the game and recommended him to [[Dominique Bijotat]], who was serving as head of the Monaco youth academy.&lt;ref name="MendyFuture" /&gt;

===Monaco===
On 27 April 2010, Mendy signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal with Monaco until June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier contrat professionnel pour Nampalys Mendy |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/monaco-premier-contrat-professionnel-pour-nampalys-mendy-27-04-2010-901878.php |date=27 April 2010 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |accessdate=15 August 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nampalys Mendy passe pro |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20100427_152012_nampalys-mendy-passe-pro.html |date=27 April 2010 |work=[[L'Equipe]] |accessdate=15 August 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823030637/http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20100427_152012_nampalys-mendy-passe-pro.html |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, he was called up to the first team by manager [[Guy Lacombe]] for pre-season training, again to make up the numbers with Lacombe missing several players such as [[Diego Pérez (footballer)|Diego Pérez]], [[Nicolas N'Koulou]], [[Park Chu-Young]], and [[Lukman Haruna]], who had all participated in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="MendyFuture" /&gt;

On 7 August 2010, Mendy made his professional debut in the club's opening league match against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].

During the [[2012–13 Ligue 2|2012–13 season]], Mendy played a key role in Monaco's promotion back to [[Ligue 1]].

===Nice===
Mendy was linked to teams such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Nampalys Mendy: Nice right move"/&gt; Despite calling Manchester United his "dream club", Mendy rejected the move to the English side because he wanted to stay in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/212979.html |publisher=ESPN |title=Mendy: Man United my 'dream club' |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some positive talks with Nice's manager, [[Claude Puel]], Mendy decided to join [[OGC Nice]] on a free transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/8856900/nice-midfielder-nanpalys-mendy-denies-manchester-united-link |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Nice midfielder Nanpalys Mendy denies Manchester United link |date=6 August 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Mendy is a former [[France national youth football team|French youth international]] having earned caps at the [[France national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], and [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]] levels. With the under-17 team, he went unnoticed by coach [[Philippe Bergeroo]] until the [[2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] when he was finally called up to the team. Mendy appeared in all three group stage matches as France were eliminated without winning a match. With the under-18 team, he made his debut on 29 October 2009 in a friendly match against the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France v.

Mendy was initially called up to the under-19 team in August 2010 only to play in the Sendai Cup in Japan, but due to his consistent performances domestically, Monaco coach Guy Lacombe convinced Bergeroo to make him a permanent part of the squad.&lt;ref name="MendyFuture" /&gt; He was officially called up to the under-19 team for [[2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification|qualification]] matches for the [[2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Mendy made his debut with the team in a 3–0 victory over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] and appeared as a starter in the next two qualification matches against [[Montenegro national under-19 football team|Montenegro]] and [[Austria national under-19 football team|Austria]], as France won both matches to finish the round undefeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France v.

On 9 November 2010, while still eligible to represent the under-19 and [[France national under-20 football team|under-20]] teams, Mendy was called up to the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] for a friendly match against [[Russia national under-21 football team|Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nampalys Mendy avec les Bleuets |url=http://www.asm-fc.com/filactu.aspx?id=13055 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120731114411/http://www.asm-fc.com/filactu.aspx?id=13055 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 31 July 2012 |date=11 November 2010 |work=[[AS Monaco FC]] |accessdate=13 November 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mendy is the cousin of fellow footballers [[Bafétimbi Gomis]] and [[Alexandre Mendy (footballer, born 1994)|Alexandre Mendy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.girondins33.com/Breves-20218-alexandre-et-nampalys-mendy-une-histoire-de-famille-dans-le-mercato-bordelais |title=Alexandre et Nampalys Mendy, une histoire de famille dans le mercato bordelais ? |website=girondins33.com |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==

'''Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi''' (born 16 December 1996) is a Nigerian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|LeicestC}} club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria national team]] as a [[midfielder]].

==Club career==
===Genk===
Ndidi made his [[Belgian Pro League]] debut with [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]] on 31 January 2015 against [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] in a 1–0 away defeat. He played the first 74 minutes of the game, before being substituted for [[Jarne Vrijsen]].&lt;ref name="soccerway2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/31/belgium/pro-league/royal-charleroi-sporting-club/krc-genk/1697243/ |title=Charleri vs. Genk – 31 January 2015 – Soccerway |publisher=soccerway.com |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Belgian League play-off game against [[Club Brugge]], Ndidi scored a long-range goal, which was named the goal of the season in the Belgian league. After receiving an attempted-clearance outside the penalty box, he lofted the ball smoothly over an opposing player before unleashing a ferocious volley into the top right corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNrukUXR8bc |title=Wilfred Ndidi Amazing Goal ● KRC Genk vs Club Brugge KV ● Belgium Jupiler League 20/04/2016 |first= |last=Football Score |date=20 April 2016 |publisher= |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160523_02303545 |title=Hanni is Profvoetballer van het Jaar, ook Preud'homme, Bailey, Sels, Ndidi en Simons bekroond |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball was adjudged to be travelling at over 111&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20160524_00830880/footballeur-pro-de-l-annee-wilfred-ndidi-auteur-du-plus-beau-but |title=Footballeur Pro de l’année: Wilfred Ndidi, auteur du plus beau but |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leicester City===
On 3 December 2016, Genk agreed a £17 million transfer deal with English champions [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccerblitz.net/2016/12/23/7-facts-you-didnt-know-about-leicester-city-new-signing-wilfred-ndidi/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224114517/http://soccerblitz.net/2016/12/23/7-facts-you-didnt-know-about-leicester-city-new-signing-wilfred-ndidi/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 December 2016 |title=7 FACTS you didn’t know about Leicester City new signing Wilfred Ndidi |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2017 |publisher=soccerblitz.com |author=Seyi Daniels}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/3031389/leicester-agree-deal-to-sign-nigeria-international-wilfred-ndidi-from-genk |title=Leicester agree deal to sign Nigeria international Wilfred Ndidi from Genk |newspaper=ESPNFC.com|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was confirmed on 5 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/2016-17/wilfred-ndidi-new-signing-trains-after-finalising-leicester-city-transfer-3503085.aspx |title=Wilfred Ndidi: New Signing Trains After Finalising Leicester City Transfer |date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=5 January 2017 |publisher=lcfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ndidi made his debut for the club on 7 January 2017, in a 2–1 win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38474504 |title=Everton 1–2 Leicester City |last=McNulty |first=Phil |date=7 January 2017 |work=www.bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=BBC Sport |language=en-GB|access-date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first [[Premier League]] start on 14 January 2017 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at home in a 3–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.com/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3925162 |title=Match Report – Leicester 0–3 Chelsea |last= |first= |date=14 January 2017 |website=www.lcfc.com |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |language=en-GB|access-date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English FA Cup game against Derby County on 8 February 2017, Ndidi came on in the first half of extra time and scored his first goal for Leicester through a long-range shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.espnfc.us/report?gameId=473321|title=Ndidi first Leicester goal|newspaper=espnfc.com|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 3–1 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 27 February 2017, Ndidi won 11 of his 14 tackles,&lt;ref name="Leicester City 3-1 Liverpool"&gt;{{cite|title = Leicester City 3–1 Liverpool|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39024318|publisher = BBC Sport|author = Phil Dawkes|date = 27 February 2017|accessdate = 3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat bettered only by Chelsea's [[N'Golo Kanté]] who made 14 tackles against the same club in January.&lt;ref name="Leicester dynamo Wilfred Ndidi has potential to surpass N'Golo Kante"&gt;{{cite|title = Leicester dynamo Wilfred Ndidi has potential to surpass N'Golo Kante|url = http://www.espnfcasia.com/club/leicester-city/375/blog/post/3070662/leicester-dynamo-wilfred-ndidi-has-potential-to-surpass-ngolo-kante|publisher = ESPN FC|author = Colin Udoh|date = 28 February 2017|accessdate = 3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Wilfred Ndidi-Nigeria.jpg|thumb|left|Wilfred Ndidi with Nigeria against Argentina, Uzomedia]]
Ndidi was part of the Nigerian youth setup during his time at Nathaniel Boys of Lagos. While playing the African U-17 Championship with Nigeria, he was excluded along with two other players from the competition as a precaution, following an MRI age test that suggested he was just slightly above the threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.naij.com/31032.html |title=Three Nigerian Footballers Caught Age Cheating |first=Katherine |last=Baffour |date=15 April 2013 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, he joined up with his teammates in the U-20 team the following year, forming the bedrock of the midfield. He was called up to the Senior [[Nigeria national football team]] on 8 October 2015, making his debut in the friendly game against DR Congo, and playing again a few days later in the 3–0 win against Cameroon, when he replaced [[John Obi Mikel]] in the 63rd minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ng/match/nigeria-v-cameroon/5fmctvxcfgmzoh832z12em6ll |title=Nigeria v Cameroon Live Commentary &amp; Result, 11/10/2015, Friendlies - Goal.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected by Nigeria for their 35-man provisional squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36623763 |title=Kelechi Iheanacho included in Nigeria's Olympics squad |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016 |author=Oluwashina Okeleji |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Nigeria’s  preliminary 30 man [[Nigeria national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb |title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? - Goal.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his senior career as a teenager at [[1. Wiener Neustädter SC|Wiener Neustadt]] before signing his first professional contract at 17 with [[SV Mattersburg]], challenging for the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga]] title and taking part in European competitions. In 2008, he left for Germany, signing for [[VfL Bochum]]. After a season on loan at [[1. FSV Mainz 05]], he signed for [[FC Schalke 04]] in 2011, where he contested the [[UEFA Champions League]] but suffered a serious knee injury. In 2015, he signed for Leicester, winning the [[Premier League]] in his first season at the club.

A full international for a decade starting from his debut in 2006, Fuchs earned 78 caps for [[Austria national football team|Austria]], making him their eighth-most capped player of all time. He played for the nation at [[UEFA Euro 2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]], captaining them for the first time in 2010 and on a permanent basis from 2012, before retiring from international duty in 2016.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Neunkirchen, Austria|Neunkirchen]], [[Lower Austria]], and his father was an amateur [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He began as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] at local team SVg Pitten before moving to [[1. Wiener Neustädter SC]] at the age of 11. At the age of 15, while still an amateur and at mainstream school, Fuchs played for their senior team. When he was 17, he signed his first professional deal at [[SV Mattersburg]], a team who despite coming from a town of 6,000 drew league record average crowds of 17,000, came third in the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga]] and played in European competition.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;

Prior to [[UEFA Euro 2008]], he joined the German side [[VfL Bochum]].&lt;ref name="Fuchs kommt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vfl-bochum.de/webcache/Aktuelles_meldung_5217_3_en.htm | title = Fuchs kommt | publisher = VfL Bochum | date = 25 June 2008 | accessdate = 30 April 2011 | language = German | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090222152751/http://www.vfl-bochum.de/webcache/Aktuelles_meldung_5217_3_en.htm | archivedate = 22 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described it as a useful move to play regularly while attracting attention from bigger teams.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt; In 2010, he was signed on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] by [[1. FSV Mainz 05]],&lt;ref name="Fuchs kommt"/&gt; a newly promoted team who ended the season in the top five.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;

===Schalke===
On 6 June 2011, Fuchs signed a contract until 30 June 2015 with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref name="Schalke sign Austria skipper Fuchs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schalke sign Austria skipper Fuchs |url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/06062011/58/bundesliga-schalke-sign-austria-skipper-fuchs.html |accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=[[Eurosport]]|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee is reportedly undisclosed by Schalke's sport and communications manager [[Horst Heldt]].&lt;ref name="Schalke sign Austria skipper Fuchs"/&gt; Fuchs was assigned the number 23 shirt, previously worn by [[Danilo Fernando Avelar]].&lt;ref name="Schalke sign Austria skipper Fuchs"/&gt;

In his time at the team from [[Gelsenkirchen]], he competed in the [[UEFA Champions League]], but suffered a long-term knee injury.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;

===Leicester City===
[[File:Leicester 0 Chelsea 3 (31944658370).jpg|thumb|Fuchs in a league match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 14 January 2017]]
On 3 June 2015, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] announced the signing of Fuchs on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]], signing a three-year deal with the Foxes effective from 1 July.&lt;ref name="Leicester City sign Christian Fuchs on free transfer from Schalke"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32999056 | title = Leicester City sign Christian Fuchs on free transfer from Schalke | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 3 June 2015 | accessdate = 10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed under previous manager [[Nigel Pearson]], Fuchs didn't have a regular spot in new manager [[Claudio Ranieri]]'s squad until October. Fuchs made an appearance in Leicester's third round League Cup tie against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], providing an assist for [[Andy King (footballer, born 1988)|Andy King]]'s extra time winner. Following a 2–5 loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 26 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34299596 |title=Ranieri must plug leaky defence |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Timothy |last=Abraham |date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranieri elected to shake up his defensive back four, inserting Fuchs and teammate [[Danny Simpson]] in place of [[Jeffrey Schlupp]] and [[Ritchie De Laet]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/norwich-1-leicester-city-2-8211-match-report/story-27915218-detail/story.html |title=Jamie Vardy and Jeff Schlupp score as City bounce back with win |work=Leicester Mercury |first=James |last=Sharpe |date=3 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007232120/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Norwich-1-Leicester-City-2-8211-match-report/story-27915218-detail/story.html |archivedate=7 October 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuchs made his first Premier League start the next week against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/fuchs-hails-foxes-defensive-resilience-2730870.aspx |title=Fuchs Hails Foxes' Defensive Resilience |work=Leicester City Football Club |date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season, Leicester finished as champions on odds of 5,000–1, making Fuchs the first Austrian to receive a [[Premier League]] winners' medal since Arsenal's [[Alex Manninger]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City: The ridiculous statistics|url=http://www.football365.com/news/leicester-city-the-ridiculous-statistics|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Football 365|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the insertion of Fuchs into the lineup on Matchday 8, Leicester City led the Premier League in clean sheets along with Arsenal, with 15. Fuchs himself led the league during this period in successful tackles with 77, while finishing second in interceptions with 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2016/05/19/team-of-the-season-christian-fuchs/ |title=Team of the Season – Christian Fuchs |work=Fantasy Football Scout |first=James |last=Harding |date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to signing for Leicester, Fuchs had an offer to play in the United States, where his family live, but he turned it down for financial reasons. He said in March 2016 "My intention is to play in the US. I have come [to Leicester] for three years. I decided that I would sign one last contract in Europe, when I left Schalke, then go to the US."&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;

On 21 October 2016, Fuchs signed a new contract with Leicester, keeping him with the club until June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37726922 |title=Christian Fuchs: Leicester City defender agrees new three-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Fuchs scored his first goal for Leicester against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], volleying home a corner-kick clearance by [[Christian Benteke]] for the team's final goal in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-centre/leicester-city-crystal-palace-live-8694433 |title=Christian Fuchs scores stunner as Foxes ease to win |work=Mirror |date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:AUT vs. MDA 2015-09-05 (042).jpg|thumb|upright|Fuchs taking a [[throw-in]] during a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifier against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in September 2015]]
Fuchs made his debut for [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 23 May 2006 in a friendly match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], replacing [[Stefan Lexa]] for the final six minutes of the 1–4 loss at the [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]] in [[Vienna]].

He was part of the Austrian international squad as they co-hosted [[UEFA Euro 2008]] alongside [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. He made only one appearance in the group stage elimination, playing the entirety of the 1–0 loss to Germany in their last match of the tournament.&lt;ref name="ÖFB (Austrian Football Association)

On 11 August 2010, in the absence of regular skipper [[Marc Janko]], Fuchs captained his nation for the first time in a 0–1 friendly loss to the Swiss in [[Klagenfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zu harmlos für die Schweiz|trans-title=Too harmless for Switzerland|url=http://sport.orf.at/stories/2008533/2008526/|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=ORF|date=13 August 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; That 17 November, he scored his first international goal, equalising in a 1–2 home friendly loss to [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debüttreffer reicht nicht|trans-title=First goal not enough|url=http://de.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=1564966.html|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=17 November 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuchs received the armband on a permanent basis at the behest of manager [[Marcel Koller]] on 13 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fußball: Christian Fuchs neuer Nationalteam-Kapitän|trans-title=Football: Christian Fuchs is new national team captain|url=http://diepresse.com/home/sport/fussball/1277914/Fussball_Christian-Fuchs-neuer-NationalteamKapitaen|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=Die Presse|date=13 August 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played all 10 games as they [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualified]] for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], the first time they did so, and featured in every minute of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 Group F|group stage elimination]] in France. Afterwards, he retired from international play with a total of 78 caps, declaring "I am very proud of the 10 years that I have spent with the national team. I did everything with passion and, as I said, I am very, very proud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Stephen|title=Leicester's Christian Fuchs quits internationals after Austria exit|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/33864/10328117/leicesters-christian-fuchs-quits-internationals-after-austria-exit|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:AUT vs. LIE 2015-10-12 (022).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fuchs, his wife, and their children, October 2015]]
Fuchs' wife Raluca Gold-Fuchs, with whom he has a stepson, son, and daughter, is a businesswoman formerly of [[Goldman Sachs]]. She lives with their children in [[Manhattan]] and Fuchs sees them once a month.&lt;ref name=ordinary&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanner|first1=Rob|title=Leicester City EXCLUSIVE: Why Christian Fuchs is no ordinary footballer|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Christian-ordinary-footballer/story-28906310-detail/story.html|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=Leicester Mercury|date=12 March 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He runs a public relations company and a football academy in the same city, and plans to move there permanently after his football career.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/04/29/leicester-city-christian-fuchs-draft/|title=Christian Fuchs is living the dream with Leicester City.

The ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' described Fuchs as "not your stereotypical footballer...[he] has more strings to his bow than an orchestra".&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt; He is noted for his online video series "No Fuchs Given", a play on his surname and the English-language obscenity "''[[fuck]]''"; the series consists of himself and teammates doing unusual football-related challenges, such as him and [[Robert Huth]] shooting the ball as hard as possible into each other's backsides.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt; His surname "Fuchs" is the German word for "[[Fox]]".

==Club career==

===Lyon===
Born in [[Décines-Charpieu]], [[Metropolitan Lyon]], in July 2010 Ghezzal signed a five-year ''élite'' contract with [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rachid Ghezzal signe un contrat Elite à l'OL |url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-6886/verts-rachid-ghezzal-signe-un-contrat-elite-a-l-ol/ |work=DZFoot |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210232308/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-6886/verts-rachid-ghezzal-signe-un-contrat-elite-a-l-ol |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After featuring with the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]] for two consecutive seasons, ahead of the [[2012–13 in French football|2012–13 season]], he was promoted to the senior team by manager [[Rémi Garde]] and assigned the number 31 shirt. Ghezzal made his senior team debut on 4 October 2012 in a [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] group stage away match against Israeli club [[Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona F.C.|Ironi Kiryat Shmona]]; he started the match as Lyon won the contest 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lyon leave it late to see off Kiryat Shmona |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000356/match=2009931/postmatch/report/index.html |work=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013–14 season, Ghezzal suffered a back injury for the first six months of Lyon's campaign, which saw him out of action until 10 January 2014, missing 32 of Lyon's games in the process. He then returned to the squad but did not make any appearances for Lyon for the rest of the season; either being not named in match day squads or being named on the bench. Since January 2016, he had been playing regularly.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He finished the 2015–16 season with 8 goals and 8 assists in 29 Ligue 1 matches.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamieson|first1=Stuart|title=Who is Sunderland target Rachid Ghezzal?

'''Adrien Sébastien Perruchet da Silva''' (born 15 March 1989), known as '''Adrien Silva''',&lt;ref name=SCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting.pt/en/football/main-team/squad/adrien-sebastian-perruchet-silva|title=Adrien Silva|publisher=Sporting CP|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Portuguese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], on loan from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]]. A [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], he is known for his dribbling and passing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportvox.fr/article.php3?id_article=14457|title=Adrien Silva: la nouvelle perle lusitaine|trans-title=Adrien Silva: the new Lusitanian pearl|publisher=Sport Vox|language=fr|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407104736/http://www.sportvox.fr/article.php3?id_article=14457|archivedate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career with [[Sporting CP|Sporting]], making his first-team debut at the age of 18. In ten years with the club he played 237 games and scored 39 goals, and won the [[2008 Taça de Portugal Final|2008]] and [[2015 Taça de Portugal Final|2015 Taça de Portugal]] trophies. He had loan spells with [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] and [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica]], where he won the Taça de Portugal again. In 2018 he moved to Leicester, and joined Monaco on loan in January 2019.

Silva won 46 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] at youth level, including 13 for the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21 team]]. He made his senior debut in 2014 and played at [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], which Portugal won, and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early years===
Silva was born in [[Angoulême]], [[Poitou-Charentes]], France, to a Portuguese father and a French mother.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olheiros.net/artigo/ler/216|title=Adrien Silva, o futuro bate à porta|trans-title=Adrien Silva, the future knocks on the door|publisher=Olheiros|language=pt|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708001443/http://www.olheiros.net/artigo/ler/216|archivedate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his football career at the age of 10 with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], but after one year there his father, who worked in [[aeronautics]], returned to Portugal and the family settled in [[Arcos de Valdevez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machainesport.fr/le-blog/2011/02/bischoff-adrien-le-juste-milieu/|title=Bischoff &amp; Adrien, le juste milieu|trans-title=Bischoff &amp; Adrien, the right midfield|publisher=Ma Chaine Sport|language=fr|date=3 February 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072525/http://www.machainesport.fr/le-blog/2011/02/bischoff-adrien-le-juste-milieu/|archivedate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva spent two seasons with local Associação Recreativa e Cultural de Paçô, who later began to host a tournament in his honour, the A.R.C.Paçô–Adrien Silva Tournament, held every June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazetadosarcos.com/ver/1930|title=Torneio Adrien Silva nos dias 10, 11 e 12 de Junho |trans-title=Adrien Silva Tournament on 10, 11, and 12 June|newspaper=Gazeta dos Arcos|language=pt|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065555/http://gazetadosarcos.com/ver/1930|archivedate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva then spent six years in [[Sporting CP|Sporting]]'s academy, and won four national and three regional championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centenariosporting.com/index.php?content=1719|title=2006–2007 – Adrien Silva no Sporting até 2012|trans-title=2006–2007 – Adrien Silva at Sporting until 2012|publisher=Centenário Sporting|language=pt|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15 he was scouted by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], along with [[Portugal national under-16 football team|Portugal under-16]] teammates Ricardo Fernandes and [[Fábio Ferreira (Portuguese footballer)|Fábio Ferreira]], and the three players trained at the English club's facilities in January 2005. Sporting filed a complaint with [[FIFA]] that Chelsea had not followed the correct procedures,&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/sports/2005/jan/06chel.htm|title=Chelsea facing FIFA complaint|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silva stayed with Sporting, although Fernandes and Ferreira did later move to the London club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~861913,00.html|title=Chelsea bring in 11 first year players|publisher=Chelsea F.C|date=5 July 2005|accessdate=25 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308221809/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10268~861913%2C00.html|archivedate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporting===
In March 2007, Silva signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a five-year deal with Sporting.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; In July, after spending the final two months of [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|the season]] playing with the [[Sporting CP B|reserve team]], he was officially promoted to the main squad by manager [[Paulo Bento]] ahead of the [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|upcoming campaign]].&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; He made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut on 17 August, appearing as a late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 4–1 home win against [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica de Coimbra]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/cm-ao-minuto/detalhe/sporting-goleia-academica|title=Sporting goleia Académica|trans-title=Sporting rout Académica|newspaper=[[Correio da Manhã]]|language=pt|date=17 August 2007|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 December, after appearing as an unused substitute in several league and European matches, he made his first professional start and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut in a 3–0 victory over [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2008/matches/round=15105/match=301242/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Sporting bow out with a win|publisher=UEFA|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later he made his first start in the league, in a 2–1 win at [[C.S. Marítimo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/desporto/futebol/detalhe/leao-soube-merecer-sorte|title=Leão soube merecer a sorte|trans-title=Lion earnt his luck|newspaper=Correio da Manhã|language=pt|date=17 December 2007|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva featured in both legs of Sporting's round of 32 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/237585?cc=5901|title=Bolton 1–1 Sporting Lisbon: Advantage Portugal|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=6 March 2008|accessdate= 26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237593&amp;cc=5901|title=Sporting Lisbon 1–0 Bolton|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April he started in the 5–3 victory over Benfica in [[2007–08 Taça de Portugal|the semi-final]] of the [[Taça de Portugal]], being replaced after only 35 minutes in what was the last of his 15 appearances of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/sporting-benfica-5-3-cronica|title=Sporting-Benfica, 5–3 (crónica)|trans-title=Sporting-Benfica, 5–3 (match report)|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=16 April 2008|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in his first year, Silva struggled for minutes in [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|2008–09]]. He played his first match on 22 November 2008 in a 1–0 league win over [[Associação Naval 1º de Maio]], playing 16 minutes off the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2008/11/22/desporto/noticia/liedshow-da-mais-tres-pontos-e-o-terceiro-lugar-ao-sporting-1350899/amp|title="Liedshow" dá mais três pontos e o terceiro lugar ao Sporting|trans-title=“Liedshow” gives Sporting another three points and third place|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|language=pt|date=22 November 2008|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start in a [[2008–09 Taça da Liga|3–0 home win]] against Marítimo in the [[Taça da Liga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/desporto/jornal/sporting-entra-a-ganhar-na-taca-da-liga-com-vitoria-sobre-o-maritimo-288014|title=Sporting entra a ganhar na Taça da Liga com vitória sobre o Marítimo|trans-title=Sporting have League Cup winning debut with victory over Marítimo|newspaper=Público|language=pt|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also made Bento's starting XI three months later in the ''Lions''' 1–7 defeat to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League last 16 second leg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2009/round=15277/match=302799|title=Record-breaking Bayern stroll past Sporting|publisher=UEFA|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 19 appearances in all competitions, notably playing the full 90 minutes in home wins against [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/desporto/jornal/liedson-deu-ao-sporting-liberdade-para-continuar-a-sonhar-com-titulo-304276|title=Liedson deu ao Sporting liberdade para continuar a sonhar com título|trans-title=Liedson allowed Sporting to keep dreaming of title|newspaper=Público|language=pt|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.D.

Silva scored his first career goal in a [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|2009–10]] [[UEFA Europa League]] group stage match against [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]], the match-winner in a [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|1–0 win]], when he also was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] after collecting a second yellow card in injury time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000037/match=2000793/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Sporting end hoodoo to streak clear|publisher=UEFA|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 2009, in the [[Derby de Lisboa|Lisbon derby]], which ended 0–0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2009/11/28/desporto/noticia/sporting-renasce-das-cinzas-mas-ainda-nao-chega-1411859|title=Sporting renasce das cinzas, mas ainda não chega|trans-title=Sporting rise from the ashes, but it's still not enough|newspaper=Público|language=pt|date=28 November 2009|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made headlines in the Portuguese media because he covered the most distance of any Sporting player, having traveled over {{convert|10,049|m|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publico.pt/Desporto/saviola-e-adrien-foram-os-que-mais-correram-no-derby-1411914|title=Saviola e Adrien foram os que mais correram no "derby"|trans-title=Saviola and Adrien ran the most in derby|newspaper=Público|language=pt|date=29 November 2009|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908131521/http://www.publico.pt/Desporto/saviola-e-adrien-foram-os-que-mais-correram-no-derby-1411914|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach [[Carlos Carvalhal]] started him in 13 of the team's next 15 matches, but he eventually fell out of favour, as Sporting went on to finish in only fourth place with 48 points, the club's worst points total since the [[1992–93 Primeira Liga|1992–93 campaign]].

On 27 June 2010, it was announced that Silva would be joining [[Israel]]i side [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.]] on a season-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-sporting-news/12488-sporting-loan-adrien-silva-to-m-haifa |title=Sporting loan Adrien Silva to Maccabi Haifa|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=27 June 2010|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807165351/http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-sporting-news/12488-sporting-loan-adrien-silva-to-m-haifa|archivedate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was facilitated by the player's agent [[Pini Zahavi]], based in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/superliga-geral/adrien-silva-adrien-sporting-maccabi-haifa-maccabi/1173303-1676.html|title=Oficial: Sporting empresta Adrien Silva a clube de Israel|trans-title=Official: Sporting loan Adrien Silva to club in Israel|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=27 June 2010|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for his new team on 29 July, in the first leg of the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League third qualifying round]] tie against [[FC Dinamo Minsk]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000126/match=2002768/index.html|title=M. Haifa 1–0 Dinamo Minsk|publisher=UEFA|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was rarely played in the [[Israeli Premier League]], but was a regular in [[2010–11 Toto Cup Al|the campaign]] in the [[Toto Cup]].

In January 2011, it was reported that Silva was considering going back to Portugal to regain match fitness. On the 16th, he spoke of his desire, telling daily sports newspaper ''[[A Bola]]'': "Returning to Portugal is an option that I like a lot since I can be followed more closely. In Israel, I don't have great visibility";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academicacoimbra.com/home.php?sel=noticia&amp;noti=501|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715131544/http://academicacoimbra.com/home.php?sel=noticia&amp;noti=501|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 July 2012|title=Adrien a caminho?|trans-title=Adrien on the way?|publisher=Académica Coimbra|language=pt|date=16 January 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a six-month loan to Académica de Coimbra was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academica-oaf.pt/noticias/futebol-profissional/860-adrien-silva-assina-pela-academica/|title=Adrien Silva assina pela Académica|trans-title=Adrien Silva signs for Académica|publisher=Académica de Coimbra|language=pt|date=19 January 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva found the net in his first appearance with the ''Students'', who were defeated 1–2 away against [[S.C. Olhanense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/academica-liga-olhanense-ficha-adrien-silva-liga-2010-11-maisfutebol/520bb22f3004acea5b9acc23.html|title=Olhanense-Académica, 2–1 (ficha)|trans-title=Olhanense-Académica, 2–1 (match sheet)|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again used rarely, but now due to injury problems – he fractured the fifth [[metatarsal]] in his right foot in a game with [[U.D.

==International career==
===Youth===
[[File:20150616 - Portugal - Italie - Genève - Adrien Silva et Franco Vazquez.jpg|thumb|300px|Silva contesting possession of the ball with [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s [[Franco Vázquez]] in a June 2015 friendly]]
Though born in France, Silva elected to play for [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], and represented the country at every youth level. With [[Portugal national under-16 football team|the under-16s]] he appeared at the ''Tournoi du Val-de-Marne'', featuring in all three group stage matches – however, after he was found to have done unauthorized training with Chelsea, he was suspended by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]].&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; He played with the [[Portugal national under-17 football team|under-17 team]] as they attempted to qualify for the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|2007 UEFA European Championship]], being a regular as the side eventually fell short in [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Championship elite round|the elite round]].

On 30 January 2007, the Portuguese Federation announced that Silva would be participating in the [[2007 UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup|2007 Meridian Cup]] (for under-18 players) as the country's only representative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=3166653|title=Adrien Silva na Meridian Cup|trans-title=Adrien Silva at the Meridian Cup|publisher=[[Portuguese Football Federation]]|language=pt|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801220805/http://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=3166653|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he declared that he was "very proud to represent Portugal in a European selection". However, prior to the start of the competition, he suffered an injury and was replaced by compatriot [[Romeu Ribeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abola.pt/nnh/index.asp?op=ver&amp;noticia=117094&amp;tema=3|title=Romeu Ribeiro chamado à selecção da Europa de sub-18|trans-title=Romeu Ribeiro called for Europe team's under-18|newspaper=[[A Bola]]|language=pt|date=23 February 2007|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225085710/http://www.abola.pt/nnh/index.asp?op=ver&amp;noticia=117094&amp;tema=3|archivedate=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva was limited to only seven appearances with the [[Portugal national under-19 football team|Portuguese under-19s]], due to his increased involvement with Sporting's first team. He scored his first goal in the age group on 6 November 2007, in [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification|the first round of qualification]] for the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2008 European Championship]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|Republic of Ireland]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under19/fixturesresults/round=15034/match=300655/index.html|title=Portugal 2–1 Republic of Ireland|publisher=UEFA|date=6 November 2007|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717065051/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under19/fixturesresults/round=15034/match=300655/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a 2–1 victory, Portugal failed to progress past the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship elite qualification|elite stages]].

On 5 February 2009, Silva earned his first call up to the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] under coach [[Rui Caçador]], for a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] with [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]] that was played five days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=4618254|title=Sub-21: Convocados|trans-title=Sub-21: The selection|publisher=Portuguese Football Federation|language=pt|date=5 February 2009|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731172244/http://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=4618254|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started and played 78 minutes, before being substituted in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=4615158|title=No bom caminho|trans-title=Right on track|publisher=Portuguese Football Federation|language=pt|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=26 December 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801035348/http://www.fpf.pt/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_FUTEBOL/SELECCOES/NOTICIA?notid=4615158|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a regular participant in the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification|qualification campaign]] for the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2011 European Championships]], appearing in five out of nine matches and scoring in a 1–1 draw with [[Macedonia national under-21 football team|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season=2011/round=2000006/match=2000226/index.html|title=Timely Portugal dash Macedonian hopes|publisher=UEFA|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2011, Slimani scored four goals in a league game against [[JS Kabylie]], leading CR Belouizdad to an impressive 7–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa-algerie.com/sport/ligue-1-ecrasante-et-historique-victoire-du-cr-belouizdad-sur-la-js-kabylie-7-1_15701.html Ligue 1 : écrasante et historique victoire du CR Belouizdad sur la JS Kabylie (7–1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521040905/http://www.tsa-algerie.com/sport/ligue-1-ecrasante-et-historique-victoire-du-cr-belouizdad-sur-la-js-kabylie-7-1_15701.html |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, with his contract expired and several French clubs such as [[OGC Nice|Nice]] and [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] showing interest in signing him, Slimani decided to sign a two-year extension with CR Belouizdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-11840-l1-islam-slimani-prolonge-au-cr-belouizdad.php|title=Islam Slimani prolonge au CR Belouizdad|publisher=DZFoot|language=French|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914011632/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-11840-l1-islam-slimani-prolonge-au-cr-belouizdad.php|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporting CP===
[[File:Chelsea-SportLisb (4) - копия.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Slimani with [[Sporting CP]] in 2014]]

On 6 August 2013, Slimani joined [[Sporting CP]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="gbio" /&gt; He started the [[2013–14 Sporting Clube de Portugal season|2013–14 season]] as a substitute, gaining a reputation as an impact player due to him scoring vital goals when coming off the bench.&lt;ref name="gbio" /&gt; Due to the lack of form of [[Fredy Montero]], however, Slimani became a starter and scored four goals in four matches in early March 2014 against [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]], [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]] and in 1–0 over [[FC Porto–Sporting CP rivalry|rivals]] [[FC Porto|Porto]].&lt;ref name="gbio" /&gt; In December 2013 he was considered the best Algerian footballer of the year as he won the Algerian Golden Ball.

In his second season Slimani was successful as he became a key player. His first goal of the season was in the [[Derby de Lisboa]] 1–1 away draw to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slimani buteur contre Benfica !|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2014/08/31/slimani-buteur-contre-benfica-50651.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At European level Slimani scored his first goal against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] at [[Estádio José Alvalade]] in the last minute to finish 4–2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LdC : Drôle de première pour Slimani !|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2014/11/05/ldc-drole-de-premiere-pour-slimani-55666.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Sporting. At the end of the season he finished third in the league, but in the Taça de Portugal he reached the [[2015 Taça de Portugal Final|final]] against [[S.C. Braga|Braga]] on 31 May 2015, slimani scored a goal helping Sporting turn around a two-goal deficit to eventually secure the [[Taça de Portugal|cup]] following a penalty shootout 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piedade|first1=Luis|title=Sporting dig deep to claim Portuguese Cup|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=por/news/newsid=2252986.html|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=16 August 2016|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he achieved his first title in his history at the end of the season Slimani played 33 games and scored 15 goals, including 12 in the league.

In the [[2015–16 Sporting Clube de Portugal season|2015–16 season]], Slimani said he would be his last season and aspires to achieve the title of the Primeira Liga absent for 14 years the new and former Benfica coach [[Jorge Jesus]], who said he would rely heavily on Slimani to win the titles and the start was in the [[2015 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Supertaça]] against Benfica and ended for Sporting with a single goal, achieving his second title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slimani gagne la Super coupe contre Benfica|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2015/08/09/slimani-gagne-la-super-coupe-contre-benfica-72734.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the tournament, Slimani scored his first goal against [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica]] in an away match on 4 October 2015, and in the seventh round against [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]], he scored his first [[List of Primeira Liga hat-tricks|hat-trick]] in the Portuguese league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slimani : Hat-trick face au Vitoria Guimaraes|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2015/10/04/slimani-hat-trik-face-au-v-guimaraes-75166.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sporting 5–1 V.

After this game, Slimani scored in four consecutive games 6 goals against [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]], [[S.C. Braga|Braga]], [[C.D. Tondela|Tondela]] and [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira|Paços de Ferreira]]. After two matches, he returned to score twice at [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]].

Before Sporting's league derby match at home, Benfica lodged a complaint against Slimani for assaulting [[Andreas Samaris]] with his elbow in a Portuguese Cup match on 21 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=8 April 2016|title=Agressão de Slimani sem castigo|trans-title=Slimani's assault without punishment|url=http://relvado.aeiou.pt/sporting/agressao-slimani-sem-castigo-515530|language=pt|work=Relvado|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long wait and one day before the match, the Portuguese League announced that Slimani could participate in the decisive match for the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal : Sporting – Benfica, Slimani en vedette|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2016/03/04/portugal-sporting-benfica-slimani-en-vedette-82414.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team lost 1–0 and dropped to second place, behind Benfica. One week later, he scored his 20th goal this season in the match against [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal : Chef d'oeuvre et 20e but de Slimani|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2016/03/12/portugal-le-but-de-grande-classe-de-slimani-82795.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this meeting, he scored four goals against [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]], [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]] and [[Moreirense F.C.|Moreirense]], and Porto. Slimani contributed to the victory at [[Estádio do Dragão]] after scoring two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal : Doublé de Slimani dans le classico|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2016/04/30/portugal-double-de-slimani-dans-le-clasiico-85471.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final round, he scored the 27 goals against [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. The match ended 4–0 but was not enough for Sporting to win the league title, as Benfica ended with more two points. That season, Slimani scored 27 goals in the league but finished behind top scorer [[Jonas Gonçalves Oliveira|Jonas]], with 32 goals.

For the following season, Sporting wanted to retain Slimani but he insisted on leaving the club, and that was finally accepted by the administration. On 28 August 2016, he played his last match against Porto at Estádio José Alvalade and scored his last goal to finish 2–1 for Sporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal : Slimani buteur pour sa dernière|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/2016/08/28/portugal-slimani-buteur-pour-sa-derniere-90003.php|website=dzfoot.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newcastle United (loan)====
On 31 January 2018, Slimani signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lcfc.com/news/610084/islam-slimani-joins-newcastle-united-on-loan/press-release|title=Islam Slimani Joins Newcastle United on Loan|publisher=Leicester City F.C.|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42889375|title=Newcastle sign Leicester striker Islam Slimani and Sparta Prague keeper Martin Dubravka on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thigh injury prevented him from making his debut for the club, which eventually happened exactly two months after signing, in a 1–0 win over [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], and he was involved in the build-up for the only goal of the game, scored by [[Ayoze Pérez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43524304|title=Newcastle 1–0 Huddesfield Town|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 March 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April, Slimani was again involved in the build-up for the match winning goal in a 2–1 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], after his header was flicked on by Pérez, and into the path of [[Matt Ritchie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43686474|title=Newcastle 2–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 April 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, Slimani was given a three match ban for violent conduct after an off-the-ball incident with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]'s [[Craig Dawson]], effectively ending his season with Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43989780|title=Islam Slimani: Newcastle forward given three-game ban|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 May 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In October 2009, Slimani was called up by [[Abdelhak Benchikha]] for the first time to the [[Algeria A' national football team|Algeria A' National Team]] for a week-long training camp in [[Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news.php?hot_id=5091 EN A' : Nouveau stage pour les joueurs locaux] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710162025/http://www.dzfoot.com/news.php?hot_id=5091 |date=10 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Slimani was called up again, this time for a [[2011 African Nations Championship – Qualification|2011 African Nations Championship qualifier]] against [[Libya]] as a replacement for his injured CR Belouizdad teammate [[Youcef Saïbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-6076/en-a-l-algerie-a-prepare-le-match-face-a-la-libye/|title=EN A' : L'Algérie A' prépare le match face à la Libye – Football algérien|date=11 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311015552/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-6076/en-a-l-algerie-a-prepare-le-match-face-a-la-libye/|archivedate=11 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Slimani did not play in the game as Algeria won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/fiche-5040.php Algérie A' 1–0 Libye A'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716115437/http://www.dzfoot.com/fiche-5040.php |date=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Slimani was called up for the first time to the [[Algeria national football team|Algeria national team]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers against [[Mali national football team|Mali]] and [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]], and the return leg of the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]] qualifier against [[Gambia national football team|Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-11476-e-n-la-liste-des-29-pour-les-matchs-de-la-fin-de-saison.php |title=La liste des 29 pour les matchs de la fin de saison |publisher=DZFoot |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514094738/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-11476-e-n-la-liste-des-29-pour-les-matchs-de-la-fin-de-saison.php |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May, he made his debut, coming as a substitute at half-time in a friendly against [[Niger national football team|Niger]].&lt;ref name="gbio" /&gt; A week later, on 2 June, Slimani scored his first international goal for Algeria, netting the third goal in the 4–0 win over [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]].&lt;ref name="ig01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/match/algeria-vs-rwanda/1230229/report|title=Algeria 4–0 Rwanda|publisher=goal.com|date=3 June 2012|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed that up with another goal against Mali in the next game,&lt;ref name="ig2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/06/10/africa/wc-qualifying-africa/mali/algeria/1230231/ |title=Mali vs. Algeria – 10 June 201 |publisher=soccerway |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then scored another two goals in the following against Gambia.&lt;ref name="ig34"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/match/algeria-vs-gambia/1234245/report |title=Algeria 4 – 1 Gambia Match report |publisher=Goal.com |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Algeria's opening match of the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]], Slimani scored the final goal in a 3–1 victory over [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30773500|title=Algeria 3–1 South Africa|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
