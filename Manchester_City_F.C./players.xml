'''Claudio Andrés Bravo Muñoz''' ({{IPA-es|ˈklauðjo ˈβɾaβo}}; born 13 April 1983) is a Chilean professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Chile national football team|Chile national team]].

He started playing with [[Colo-Colo]] and moved to [[Real Sociedad]] in 2006, appearing in 237 official games with the latter club. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] signed him for €12 million in 2014, and he won the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] and the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy|Zamora Trophy]] in [[2014–15 La Liga|his first season]]. In the summer of 2016, he moved to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

Bravo is [[Chile national football team|Chile]]'s second most capped player of all time, after [[Alexis Sánchez]], with over 115 appearances since his debut in 2004, and represented the nation in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], a [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] and five [[Copa América]] tournaments. He [[Captain (association football)|captained]] his side to victory at the [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and [[Copa América Centenario|2016 editions]] of the latter competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/news/y=2017/m=6/news=a-closer-look-at-the-confed-cup-captains-2895407.html|title=Meet the Confed Cup captains|publisher=FIFA|date=17 June 2017|accessdate=18 June 2017|quote=He [Claudio Bravo] was a key part of the teams that competed at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups and, as captain, had the honour of raising the Copa America trophy in 2015 and 2016.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Colo-Colo===
Bravo was born in [[Buin, Chile|Viluco]], [[Maipo Province]]. His father recognized his son's emerging talent and took him to [[Colo-Colo]]'s youth academy, and he eventually made his professional debut in 2002. There, he was given the nickname ''Cóndor Chico'', after former club goalkeeper [[Roberto Rojas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.net/getting-to-know-claudio-bravo_308059#|title=Getting to know Claudio Bravo|publisher=Sport.net|last=Cernensek|first=Bostjan|date=23 January 2015|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an injury to [[Eduardo Lobos]], manager [[Jaime Pizarro]] gave Bravo his first chance, which would be however short-lived, as he too was injured, which prompted the subsequent signing of [[Jonny Walker (soccer)|Jonny Walker]]. He recovered in mid-2003, and with Lobos still in the sidelines he took over the starting role which he would never lose again, with his competitor eventually being sold.

In 2006, Bravo won his first title, making an acrobatic save in the ''[[Apertura and Clausura|Apertura]]'''s [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] final win against arch-rival [[C.F. Universidad de Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ferplei.com/2013/07/se-cumplen-siete-anos-del-cara-a-cara-entre-mayer-candelo-vs-claudio-bravo-video/|title=Se cumplen siete años del cara a cara entre Mayer Candelo vs Claudio Bravo [VIDEO]|trans-title=Faceoff between Mayer Candelo and Claudio Bravo was seven years ago [VIDEO]|publisher=Ferplei|language=es|date=2 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real Sociedad===
For the [[2006–07 La Liga|2006–07 season]], Bravo signed a five-year contract with [[Real Sociedad]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.realsociedad.com//document/view/spa//57947/comunicado-oficial--principio-de-acuerdo-con-bravo | title = Comunicado oficial: Principio de acuerdo con Bravo | trans-title = Official announcement: Initial agreement with Bravo | publisher = Real Sociedad | language = es | date = 28 June 2006 | accessdate = 18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a reported €1.2 million deal –&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.donostiasansebastian.com/noticias3.php?id=102 | title = La Real ficha al portero Claudio Bravo | trans-title = Real sign goalkeeper Claudio Bravo | publisher = Donostia San Sebastián | language = es | date = 21 June 2006 | accessdate = 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and [[Asier Riesgo]] formed the youngest pair of goalkeepers that year in [[La Liga]]. He started on [[Substitute (association football)|the bench]], but eventually gained the battle for first-choice (29 games to nine) as the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] side was relegated (despite this, he finished in fifth place for the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]] with a goal-against average of 1.00); his league debut came on 22 October 2006, in a 0–0 away draw against [[RCD Mallorca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2006/10/22/futbol/1161538421.html | title = Los palos salvan a la Real de otra derrota | trans-title = Posts prevent another Real loss | newspaper = [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] | language = es | date = 22 October 2006 | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[2007–08 Segunda División|The following season]], Riesgo reclaimed his starting position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/2a_division/real_sociedad/es/desarrollo/1040758.html|title=Riesgo se pone 'Bravo'|trans-title=Riesgo gets all 'Brave' ("Bravo" in English)|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|last=Badallo|first=Óscar|language=es|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[2008–09 Segunda División|2008–09]], however, after a loan to the former to [[Recreativo de Huelva]], Bravo was again the starter, but Real remained in [[Segunda División]]. He was the joint-recipient of the campaign's Zamora, alongside [[David Cobeño]] of [[Rayo Vallecano]].&lt;ref name=Perfect&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chile.as.com/chile/2015/05/22/futbol/1432318909_260400.html|title=Claudio Bravo gana el 'Zamora' y se encamina al año perfecto|trans-title=Claudio Bravo wins the 'Zamora' and caps a perfect year|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|last=Reyes|first=Luis|language=es|date=23 May 2015|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2010, Bravo was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] for the first time in a loss to [[Elche CF]] at [[Anoeta Stadium]], fouling [[Óscar Trejo]] in the ninth minute, from which [[Jorge Molina Vidal|Jorge Molina]] scored a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] for the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/01/24/futbol/2adivision/1264360234.html|title=Un error de Bravo deja a la Real sin liderato|trans-title=Bravo's error takes the lead from Real|newspaper=Marca|language=es|date=24 January 2010|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, he scored the first goal of his career, from a [[direct free kick]] against [[Gimnàstic de Tarragona]], the game's only in a home triumph;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.europapress.es/deportes/futbol-00162/noticia-futbol-liga-adelante-cronica-gol-portero-bravo-da-victoria-real-sociedad-nastic-20100214190407.html | title = (Crónica) Un gol del portero Bravo da la victoria a la Real Sociedad ante el Nástic | trans-title = (Report) Goal by goalkeeper Bravo gives win to Real Sociedad against Nástic | publisher = [[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]] | language = es | date = 14 February 2010 | accessdate = 29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPKE3CmCKy0 | title = Gol de falta del portero Bravo – Real sociedad vs Nastic! | trans-title = Free kick goal from goalkeeper Bravo – Real sociedad vs Nastic! | publisher = [[YouTube]] | language = es | date = 14 February 2010 | accessdate = 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, shortly after, he suffered a severe knee injury during Real Sociedad's 0–2 loss at [[Córdoba CF]], which rendered him unavailable for the remainder of [[2009–10 Segunda División|the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.marca.com/2010/03/30/futbol/equipos/real_sociedad/1269959532.html | title = Bravo: "Estoy triste por no poder ayudar al equipo" | trans-title = Bravo: "I'm sad for not being able to help the team" | newspaper = Marca | language = es | date = 30 March 2010 | accessdate = 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still featured in 25 matches to help his team finish champions and return to the top division, after three years.

===Barcelona===
[[File:Barça - Napoli - 20140806 - Claudio Bravo.jpg|thumb|150px|Bravo warming up for Barcelona in 2014]]
Bravo joined [[FC Barcelona]] on 25 June 2014, with the four-year deal&lt;ref name="Release"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2013-2014/agreement-for-claudio-bravo-to-join-fc-barcelona|title= Agreement for Claudio Bravo to join FC Barcelona|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=25 June 2014|access-date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; being made effective on 1 July for a reported €12 million (£9.7 million) fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.marca.com/2014/06/18/futbol/equipos/barcelona/1403127536.html | title = Bravo ya es el tercer fichaje del Barcelona | trans-title = Bravo is already Barcelona's third signing | newspaper = Marca | last = Font | first = Sergi | language = es | date = 18 June 2014 | accessdate = 21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/112769/real-sociedad-and-barcelona-finalise-e12-million-transfer-of-claudio-bravo/ | title = Real Sociedad and Barcelona finalise €12 million transfer of Claudio Bravo | publisher = Inside Spanish Football | last = Conn | first = Tom | date = 18 June 2014 | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140619165255/http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/112769/real-sociedad-and-barcelona-finalise-e12-million-transfer-of-claudio-bravo/ | archivedate = 19 June 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth most expensive player ever sold by Real Sociedad after [[Darko Kovačević]], [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Asier Illarramendi]], becoming the second Chilean to ever play for the club after [[Alexis Sánchez]] and succeeding [[Víctor Valdés]] as the first-choice. After joining, he set a Spanish League record for the club of not conceding from the start of season for 754 minutes, previously held by [[Pedro María Artola]] with 560 minutes; the streak was broken when he conceded his first goal of [[2014–15 La Liga|the season]] from the penalty spot to [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in a 1–3 defeat to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/claudio-bravo-leaves-record-at-754-minutes|title=Claudio Bravo leaves record at 754 minutes|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=25 October 2014|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After playing 37 straight league games, Bravo was rested for the last game of the campaign against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], with [[Jordi Masip]] starting instead. The former was named as the goalkeeper in the La Liga Team of the Season as one of six Barcelona players, including three of his defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3126163/Lionel-Messi-Cristiano-Ronaldo-lead-La-Liga-team-year-Gareth-Bale-misses-out.html|title=Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi lead La Liga team of the year... but there's no place for Gareth Bale after disappointing season|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|last=Skinner|first=Adam|date=17 June 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Zamora for the best goals against average in the competition, conceding 19 times for an average of 0.51, 0.04 off the all-time record by [[Francisco Liaño]] of Deportivo in 1994.&lt;ref name=Zamora&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/claudio-bravo-wins-first-zamora-trophy|title=Claudio Bravo wins first Zamora Trophy|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=24 May 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Marc-André ter Stegen]] was preferred for Barcelona's wins in the year's [[Copa del Rey]], [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Super Cup]], Bravo made his cup debut for the team as they won the [[2015 FIFA Club World Cup]], keeping [[Shutout|clean sheets]] in their 3–0 wins over [[Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35141742|title=River Plate 0–3 Barcelona|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|last=Begley|first=Emlyn|date=20 December 2015|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by [[Esport3]] on the subject of the rotation, he said "If I were to say that I'm taking it well, I would be lying, but I accept it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es-cl/news/4809/espa%C3%B1a/2015/11/02/16915842/claudio-bravo-y-su-incomodidad-con-la-rotaci%C3%B3n|title=Claudio Bravo y su incomodidad con la rotación|trans-title=Claudio Bravo and his discomfort with rotation|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|language=es|date=2 November 2015|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
An authoritative presence in goal, Bravo is known for his leadership, agility, composure and shot-stopping ability, as well as his control, distribution and skill with the ball at his feet. Due to his speed when rushing off his line to anticipate opponents who have beaten the offside trap, he has been described as a ''[[Goalkeeper (association football)#Sweeper-keeper|sweeper keeper]]''; he has also been labelled as a [[Playmaker#Playmaking in other positions|playmaking goalkeeper]], due to his ability to play the ball out from the back or launch attacks from goal-kicks.&lt;ref name="Release"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37610692|title='Man City's Claudio Bravo is a playmaker not sweeper-keeper'|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Brown-Finnis|first=Rachel|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2940293/how-marc-andre-ter-stegen-beat-claudio-bravo-for-barcelona-goalkeeper-job|title=Marc-Andre ter Stegen shows why he won the Barcelona goalkeeper job|publisher=ESPN FC|last=Hunter|first=Graham|date=30 August 2016|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/3300856/man-city-keeper-ederson-as-important-as-david-de-gea-is-for-man-united|title=Man City keeper Ederson as important as David De Gea is for Man United|publisher=ESPN FC|last=Ogden|first=Mark|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/liga/news/1289056-perfect-player-series-building-a-flawless-goalkeeper|title=Perfect player series: Building a flawless goalkeeper|publisher=The Score|last=Nesci|first=Gianluca|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Sheffield United===
Walker joined boyhood club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]],&lt;ref name=es&gt;{{cite news |title=My dad was petrified I'd get killed on the M1, so I had to follow him to Northampton, says Kyle Walker |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/football/article-24011485-my-dad-was-petrified-id-get-killed-on-the-m1-so-i-had-to-follow-him-to-northampton-says-kyle-walker.do |newspaper=London Evening Standard |accessdate=18 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119233404/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/football/article-24011485-my-dad-was-petrified-id-get-killed-on-the-m1-so-i-had-to-follow-him-to-northampton-says-kyle-walker.do |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of seven after being recommended by coach Paul Archer at [[Football Unites, Racism Divides]] and progressed through the ranks to become a regular fixture in the reserves by 2008.&lt;ref name="telegraph-ambassador"/&gt; In November 2008, he was allowed to join [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on a one-month [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to gain first team experience,&lt;ref name="Northampton loan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Walker on the move |url=http://origin-www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~1453606,00.html |publisher=Sheffield United F.C. |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; making his debut on 15 November 2008 in a defeat by [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].&lt;ref name="Northampton debut"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gray upset by defeat |url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/MatchReaction/0,,10425~1435139,00.html |publisher=Northampton Town F.C. |date=16 November 2008 |accessdate=22 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902102105/http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/MatchReaction/0%2C%2C10425~1435139%2C00.html |archivedate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His one-month loan was later extended into January,&lt;ref name="Northampton loan extended"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kyle extends loan |url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10425~1494573,00.html |publisher=Northampton Town F.C. |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=22 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902102119/http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10425~1494573%2C00.html |archivedate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before eventually returned to Bramall Lane having played nine matches for the Cobblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Walker returns to parent club |url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10425~1501496,00.html |publisher=Northampton Town F.C. |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817205302/http://www.ntfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10425~1501496%2C00.html |archivedate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after returning to his parent club, Walker made his full debut for Sheffield United on 13 January 2009, starting in a third round [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].&lt;ref name="blades debut"&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 22 July 2009, Walker left Sheffield United to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] along with fellow defender [[Kyle Naughton]] for a combined fee of £9&amp;nbsp;million, but was loaned back to United for the duration of the 2009–10 season as part of the deal.&lt;ref name="spurs transfer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spurs capture Naughton and Walker |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/8144711.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at [[Bramall Lane]] he was virtually ever present at right back for the first half of the season but was unexpectedly recalled back to Spurs on 1 February 2010, just before the close of the January 2010 [[transfer window]], as cover for [[Alan Hutton]] who was loaned out to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] earlier the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham Hotspur recall Sheffield United's Walker |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Tottenham-Hotspur-recall-Sheffield-United39s.6034450.jp |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=2 January 2010 |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker made his debut for Tottenham on Saturday 27 March 2010, in a 2–0 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name="spurs debut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham 2 Portsmouth 0: Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar pile on the pain for Pompey |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1261128/Tottenham-2-Portsmouth-0-Peter-Crouch-Niko-Kranjcar-pile-pain-Pompey.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=28 March 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ridley}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kyle Walker Spurs USA tour 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Walker with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2010]]

==International career==
[[File:Vincent Kompany - Belgium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kompany playing for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], 2011]]

Kompany made his international debut aged just 17 for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in February 2004 against [[France national football team|France]], as one of the youngest players ever.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] called up Kompany to the [[2008 Beijing Olympics|2008 Olympics]]. Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1–0 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.

In November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&amp;nbsp;pm that evening. As it happened, he did not return until nearly midnight. Furious, Advocaat removed him from the squad altogether, although on 24 February 2010 he was recalled to the Belgium squad by Advocaat for the friendly against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romelu Lukaku est officiellement Diable Rouge |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/diables-rouges/article/301782/romelu-lukaku-est-officiellement-diable-rouge.html |language=French |newspaper=La Dernière Heure |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocaat resigned his post on 15 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/7594670/Dick-Advocaat-resigns-as-Belgium-coach.html|title=Dick Advocaat resigns as Belgium coach|date=15 April 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 February 2018 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2010, Kompany scored a 90th-minute goal to give Belgium a 2–1 win over [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a friendly. On 10 November 2011, a day before the friendly against [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Georges Leekens]] named Kompany as Belgium captain, succeeding [[Thomas Vermaelen]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

After 34 minutes of Belgium's 2–1 [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] win against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in June 2013, Kompany suffered concussion and facial injuries, including a broken nose and cracked eye-socket, in a collision with goalkeeper [[Vladimir Stojković]].

At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, Kompany featured in five of his nation's seven matches, playing every minute in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout phase]] as they advanced to the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions
[[France national football team|France]], overcoming [[England national football team|England]] to finish third, their highest ever placing in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44748604|title=Belgium 2–0 England|date=14 July 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his friends are former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] goalkeeper [[Yves Ma-Kalambay]] and former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] defender [[Floribert N'Galula]], both of whom he consulted about his move to England before joining Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=John |date=January 2006 |title=Q&amp;A: Vincent Kompany |journal=[[FourFourTwo]] |issue=137 |page=150 |location=Teddington |publisher=Haymarket Consumer |editor1-first=Hugh |editor1-last=Sleight |issn=1355-0276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kompany married his [[Manchester|Mancunian]] girlfriend, Carla Higgs, a lifelong Manchester City [[Manchester City F.C. supporters|supporter]] on 11 June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='I'm so proud of my Vince', says Kompany's wife Carla |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1502354_im-so-proud-of-my-vince-says-kompanys-wife-carla |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they have a daughter, Sienna, who was born on 10 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kompany father of daughter Sienna|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/950/Buitenlands-Voetbal/article/detail/1118551/2010/06/14/Kompany-vader-van-dochter-Sienna.dhtml|newspaper=Het Laatste Nieuws|accessdate=14 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617191506/http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/950/Buitenlands-Voetbal/article/detail/1118551/2010/06/14/Kompany-vader-van-dochter-Sienna.dhtml|archivedate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kompany has a number of pastimes and interests which keep him occupied outside of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vincent Kompany: Manchester derby is world's biggest after El Clásico |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/27/vincent-kompany-manchester-el-clasico |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an interest in politics and graduated with an [[MBA]]  at [[Manchester Business School]] in 2018 after several years of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kompany goes back to school as City skipper studies for business degree |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2088889/Vincent-Kompany-to-university-business-degree.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/vincent-kompany-graduates-degree-alliance-manchester-business-school/ |title=Premier League Club Captain graduates with degree from Alliance Manchester Business School |work=[[University of Manchester]] |date=29 December 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kompany has been characterized as "erudite" and "eloquent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchestercity/article4208800.ece|title=Vincent Kompany talks up Manchester City’s chances|newspaper=The Times|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Kompany opened two new sports bars in Belgium by the name of Good Kompany, one at the Grand Place in [[Brussels]] and the other at the Groenplaats in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Good Kompany: Manchester City captain Vincent opens sports bars in Belgium|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2607812/In-good-Kompany-Manchester-City-captain-open-sports-bars-Belgium.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=18 April 2014 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kompany closed down both bars within a year of their opening. At the time of their closure, Kompany was quoted as saying "I regret this decision. We had enough customers, turnover was good, but not enough to cover the costs. So that's where it ends. Lesson 1 in business: investments are always a risk. You win some, you lose some."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Good Kompany' closes its doors in Antwerp|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/videozone_ENG/1.2248947|newspaper=Flandersnews.be |date=23 February 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for his technical ability and physical presence, Stones is celebrated for being a ball-playing central defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcfcwatch.com/2017/10/26/city-stat-john-stones-is-european-footballs-pass-master-in-201718 |title=City Stat: John Stones is European football’s pass master in 2017/18 – City Watch |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teammates and coaches have praised his composure with the ball,&lt;ref name="goal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/stones-has-as-much-composure-as-any-defender-in-europe-says/3ggjk0euxk8o1cjjszcmd11vm |title=England: Southgate gushes over Stones, compares him to Pique and Boateng - Goal.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defensive skills,&lt;ref name="mcfcwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcfcwatch.com/2017/10/26/city-stat-john-stones-is-european-footballs-pass-master-in-201718/ |title=City Stat: John Stones is European football’s pass master in 2017/18 – City Watch |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; range of passing,&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/09/john-stones-pep-guardiola-flaws-manchester-city-everton |title=John Stones: a rare talent but value only if Pep Guardiola removes the flaws – Andy Hunter |first=Andy |last=Hunter |date=9 August 2016 |website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, vision&lt;ref name="mcfcwatch.com"/&gt; and versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2016/august/john-stones-in-quotes |title=John Stones: In Quotes |website=MCFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Joleon Lescott]] said of his ability: "John can do things most defenders can’t – a little feign here and there, maybe a turn to get out of trouble when he needs to – and that’s what is going to set him apart from others – the ability to do things others can’t. He’ll do his job and defend well, but there will be moments when he does something special and you’ll just go ‘ah, that’s why he’s regarded as the best.’ He doesn’t seem to get fazed by anything and always seems calm and he never hides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2017/november/joleon-lescott-impressed-with-john-stones |title=Lescott: Stones has the X-Factor |website=MCFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester City and England teammate [[Kyle Walker]] added "You don't quite appreciate him until you are playing alongside him. He rarely gets beat, he is great on the ball and he is very calm and level-headed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11130440/man-citys-kyle-walker-hails-unbelievable-john-stones-and-special-pep-guardiola |title=Man City's Kyle Walker hails 'unbelievable' John Stones and 'special' Pep Guardiola |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed his ball-playing style early in his career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11125793/how-paul-heckingbottom-moulded-careers-of-john-stones-alfie-mawson-and-mason-holgate |title=How Paul Heckingbottom moulded careers of John Stones, Alfie Mawson and Mason Holgate |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many crediting Manchester City coach [[Pep Guardiola]] for his later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-pep-guardiolas-love-is-helping-john-stones-fulfil-potential-t39pnmhlw |title=How Pep Guardiola's love is helping John Stones fulfil potential |first=Paul |last=Hirst |date=4 October 2017 |work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His range of passing has led to comparisons with [[Rio Ferdinand]],&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; [[Gerard Piqué]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-city/story/2998808/pep-guardiola-compares-john-stones-to-gerard-pique-of-barcelona |title=Stones compares to a young Pique – Pep |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jérôme Boateng]],&lt;ref name="goal.com"/&gt; [[Pep Guardiola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/11/16/john-stones-no-longer-soft-touch-instead-rock-heart-manchester/ |title=John Stones is no longer a soft touch, but instead a rock at heart of Manchester City's defence – thanks largely to Pep Guardiola's patience |first=James |last=Ducker |date=16 November 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Beckenbauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport360.com/article/football/english-premier-league/253060/john-stones-on-striving-for-man-city-dominance-comparison-with-franz-beckenbauer-and-coming-up-against-neymar-at-wembley |title=John Stones striving for sustained Manchester City domination in England and Europe |publisher=Sport 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] midfielder [[Xavi]] said in November 2014 that Sterling is good enough to play for the [[La Liga]] club, praising his physical and technical qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool's Raheem Sterling good enough to play for Barcelona, says Xavi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/11/liverpool-raheem-sterling-barcelona-xavi |accessdate=15 November 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emperors &amp; Empires: Barcelona's Xavi discusses the modern game in exclusive interview |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/emperors-empires-barcelonas-xavi-discusses-the-modern-game/217333 |first=Sanjit |last=Atwal |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014 |publisher=Squawka News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, ''[[BBC Sport]]'' columnist Phil McNulty wrote that Sterling was "very good with the potential to be outstanding" but remained a "work in progress" due to inconsistent performances. He also wrote, "He is blessed with natural pace that makes even the best defences and defenders take a step back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Raheem Sterling is not the finished article at Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32147641 |accessdate=1 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 2013, citing the influence of his mother, Sterling was quoted as saying he was "not 100 per cent religious but my belief is strong. When the time is right, I will fully be Christian."  He added that he put his faith in God and that he prays regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fcs-raheem-sterling-happy-3325424 |title=Liverpool FC's Raheem Sterling happy to keep taking the hits – so long as he's contributing to goals |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one daughter, Melody Rose, born in 2012 after a brief relationship.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

On 8 August 2013, Sterling was arrested for an alleged common assault on his former girlfriend, a model. He was found not guilty at Liverpool Magistrates Court on 20 September, when the complainant was unable to offer consistent evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=De Menezes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-winger-raheem-sterling-arrested-on-charge-of-assault-8754230.html |title=Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrested on charge of assault |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/20/raheem-sterling-cleared-assault |title=Liverpool's Raheem Sterling cleared of assault on former girlfriend |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months earlier, on 20 May 2013, a charge of common assault on a different woman was dropped after a witness failed to turn up to court.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Liverpool winger bids to shed bad boy image |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26774538 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Sterling was photographed by the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' allegedly smoking a [[Hookah|shisha pipe]], and by [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] allegedly inhaling [[nitrous oxide]] for recreational purposes. Manager Brendan Rodgers said, "I don't think it is something you should be doing, it's as simple as that...Young players make mistakes. As long as they learn from them, that is what is important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Liverpool star alleged to have taken laughing gas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32295792 |accessdate=14 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] in which 71 people died, Sterling made a "substantial" donation to those affected by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ornstein |first=David |title=Grenfell Tower fire: Man City winger Raheem Sterling to make donation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40297310 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2017, Sterling was attacked outside Manchester City's training ground by a man who used racist language towards him. Four days later, 29-year-old Karl Anderson, a convicted football hooligan, pleaded guilty to racially aggravated common assault and was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison and a £100 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: hooligan admits racially aggravated attack on Man City winger |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42429178 |accessdate=20 December 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' praised Sterling's resilience and courage in deciding to play only four hours afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/22/why-we-should-take-our-hats-off-to-raheem-sterling |title=Abuse of easy target Raheem Sterling leaves bitter taste in mouth |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Barney Ronay |date=22 December 2017 |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterling has an [[M16 rifle]] tattooed on his leg. He received criticism from anti-violence groups but said that the tattoo had deeper meaning and referred to his father who was killed when Sterling was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44285455 |title=England striker defends gun tattoo |date=29 May 2018 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of Sterling by Britain's tabloid media, especially ''The Sun'', has been deemed unfair and racist by pundits including [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Manchester City winger is targeted by racism, says Ian Wright |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45177178 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mcleod |first1=Maurice |title=As Raheem Sterling knows, successful black men have targets on their back |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/raheem-sterling-media-young-black-men-footballer-tattoo |accessdate=13 August 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stopes |first1=Harry |title=The Press v.

===Sponsorship===
In 2012, Sterling signed a sponsorship deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. He appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside [[Mario Götze]], [[Theo Walcott]], [[Eden Hazard]], [[Christian Eriksen]] and [[Stephan El Shaarawy]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/7951-liverpools-raheem-sterling-wears-the-nike-gs2.html |title=Raheem Sterling Wears the Nike GS2 |publisher=Football Boots |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/nike-gs.html |title=Nike GS2 Football Boots |website=FootballBoots.co.uk |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, he modelled the new [[Nike Mercurial Vapor]] IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpHaaLJs1QY |title=Nike Mercurial Vapor IX – Raheem Sterling |via=YouTube |publisher=Copa90 |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of playing for the different youth teams, Gündoğan received his first call-up to the [[Germany national football team|Germany senior team]] in August 2011 for a [[friendly match]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], but did not feature in the game. On 11 October, he made his debut for Germany after coming on as a substitute for captain [[Philipp Lahm]] for the last six minutes of the 3–1 win against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] match at the [[Esprit Arena]], [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany stamp out Belgium's fire|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15171/match=2002112/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=UEFA|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, he was selected by manager [[Joachim Löw]] for the German 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and was given the number two shirt. Germany reached the semi-finals, but Gündoğan did not feature.

==Style of play==
[[Jürgen Klopp]], Gündoğan's former coach at Borussia Dortmund, described Gündoğan as an "intelligent and complete midfielder with numerous strengths".&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Nick|title=Ilkay Gundogan: We profile the Manchester United target|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/21476/9821981/ilkay-gundogan-we-profile-the-midfielder-wanted-by-manchester-united|website=Sky Sports|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gündoğan had a tough start at Dortmund, where he admitted "things hadn't gone as well as I had thought", his "willingness to learn" and "great attitude", according to Klopp, have allowed him to play a pivotal role in his later career at the club.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt; He was able to fit into Dortmund's explosive playing style "by combining creativity and outstanding passing with the defensive attributes and tireless energy needed".&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

In May 2018, Gündoğan met [[President of Turkey]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] in London, along with [[Mesut Özil]] and [[Cenk Tosun]], two other English-based, German-born players of Turkish origin. Gündoğan was criticised for referring to the statesman as "my president", despite only being a citizen of Germany.

'''Sergio Leonel Agüero''' ({{IPA-es|ˈseɾxjo le.oˈnel aˈɣweɾo}}; born 2 June 1988) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]].

Agüero began his career at [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]]. On 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to play in the [[Argentine Primera División]] on his debut at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by [[Diego Maradona]] in [[Seasons in Argentine football|1976]]. In 2006, he moved to Europe to play for [[La Liga]] side [[Atlético Madrid]], for a transfer fee of €23 million and made a name for himself, attracting attention from Europe's top clubs by scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances while winning the [[UEFA Europa League]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in 2010.

Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for [[List of most expensive association football transfers|an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million]]. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Best goal ratios of Premier League players |url=https://www.premierleague.com/gallery/111326 |work=Premier League |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The best Opta Stats from Saturday's Premier League games |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10016044/the-best-opta-stats-from-saturdays-premier-league-games |work=Sky Sports |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Agüero became [[List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics#All-time top goalscorers|Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer]], scoring his 178th City goal against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41710035 |title=Aguero: More than just a record goalscorer |date=2 November 2017 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero is currently the 8th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with over [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|100 goals in the division]].

At international level, Agüero represented the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20 team]] at the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|2005]] and in [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2007]], winning both tournaments.&lt;ref name=rise/&gt; He played at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Beijing Olympics]], scoring two goals in the 3–0 semi-final win against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] as Argentina went on to win the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/argentina-3-brazil-0-argentina-in-final-after-routing-arch-rivals-902777.html |title=Argentina 3 Brazil 0: Argentina in final after routing arch rivals – Olympics, Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |location=London |first1=Nick |last1=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero was selected to represent Argentina in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2011 Copa América]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa América]], and the [[Copa América Centenario]], reaching the finals of the latter three tournaments. He also participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], where he scored his first and second World Cup goals for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].

He wears "Kun" on his shirt, a childhood nickname based on the title character from the cartoon [[Kum-Kum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-aguero-on-how-kun-4501690|author=Sergio Aguero|title=Sergio Aguero on.. how he got his "Kun" nickname and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- note: source does not explicitly name the cartoon, but it names the character and describes the caveman setting --&gt;

He started playing for the side, becoming the youngest player to debut in the division at 15 years and 35 days (on 5 July 2003 against [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro]]), when Independiente's coach, [[Oscar Ruggeri]] sent Agüero onto the field as a substitute for [[Emanuel Benito Rivas|Emanuel Rivas]] in the 69th minute of the match.&lt;ref name=rise&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384547.stm |title=The Rise of Sergio Aguero |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/23/millones/menor/edad/elpepidep/20060601elpepidep_1/Tes |title=23 millones por un menor de edad |work=El País |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2012 |language=Spanish |last1=Borasteros |first1=Daniel |last2=Casar |first2=Alejandro}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was well received by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/07/06/d-06215.htm |title=San Lorenzo, de la galera |work=Clarín |date=6 July 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |language=Spanish |last=Castillo |first=Hernán}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/2003/07/06/c-585306.htm |title=Diario Deportivo Olé – Pájaro de buen Agüero |publisher=Old.ole.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/509319-muy-frio-san-lorenzo-gano-un-clasico-pobre |title=Muy frío: San Lorenzo ganó un clásico pobre – 06.07.2003 |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his early debut, he was not selected again by Ruggeri, and his replacement [[Osvaldo Sosa]], for the remainder of [[2002–03 Argentine Primera División|2002–03 season]], having made only one appearance in the [[2002–03 in Argentine football|Torneo Clausura]]. Following the arrival of coach [[Jose Omar Pastoriza]], seven months after Agüero's first match he returned to the club's first-team in 4–2 win against [[Peru|Peru's]] [[Cienciano]] during the group stages of the [[2004 Copa Libertadores]]. This meant that he also became the youngest player to participate in the [[Copa Libertadores]], a record that he held for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=341620 |title=La Crónica de Hoy &amp;#124; Prematuro debut, ¿el prólogo de una gran carrera? |publisher=Cronica.com.mx |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, Agüero again featured in a Copa Libertadores fixture against [[Ecuador|Ecuador's]] [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|El Nacional]].

During the [[2005–06 in Argentine football|2005–06 season]], Agüero scored 18 goals in 36 league appearances, having missed two games due to suspension. In a 4–0 win against [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] on 11 September, he dribbled from inside of his own half and scored Independiente's fourth goal with a left footed shot.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independiente1905.com.ar/noticias/noti_29.htm |title=Sergio Agüero, El Demonio Rojo |publisher=Independiente1905.com.ar |date=13 September 2005 |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425083032/http://www.independiente1905.com.ar/noticias/noti_29.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first red card came in the Torneo Apertura, after slapping an opponent in a match against [[Tiro Federal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/apertura05/partido/2987.shtml |title=Deportes &gt; Torneo apertura 2005 |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His outstanding performances during the [[2005–06 Argentine Primera División|Torneo Apertura]] attracted interest from a number of large European clubs, and, after months of speculation, Agüero announced on TV in April that he intended to leave the club at the end of the season. Before the end of the season, there had already been speculation of a possible transfer to [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; With his performances being lauded by the press, there was talk of a possible call up for Agüero for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=427233 |title=Suma goles, suma apoyo popular – Mundial2006 – ESPN Deportes |publisher=Espndeportes.espn.go.com |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=443923 |title=Tres nombres que no hubieran faltado – Mundial2006 – ESPN Deportes |publisher=Espndeportes.espn.go.com |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/788856-aguero-todos-piden-por-el |title=Agüero: todos piden por él – 15.03.2006 |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date=15 March 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2–0 away victory against [[Olimpo de Bahia Blanca]] in round 17 of the Torneo Clausura, Agüero received his fifth yellow card of the season.

===Atlético Madrid===
====2006–07 season====
[[File:SergioAgüero.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Agüero playing for Atlético Madrid in October 2007.]]
In May 2006, Agüero joined Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]] for a fee reported to be around €20 million, breaking the club's previous transfer record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369484&amp;cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |title=Atlético agree fee for Independiente starlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369713&amp;cc=4716 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |title=Atlético sign Argentine prodigy Agüero}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caused controversy early in his Atlético career by using his hands to score the winning goal against [[Recreativo de Huelva]] on 14 October 2006, only his second goal for the club, with the first coming in a 4–1 away win against [[Athletic Bilbao]] on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=204980&amp;cc=null&amp;league=ESP.1 |publisher=ESPN |title=Atlético Madrid 2–1 Recreativo Huelva}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his first season in Madrid with seven goals in all competitions, eased into European football by manager [[Javier Aguirre]], who opted to bring him in and out of the line-up as Atlético finished seventh, enough to qualify for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

====2007–08 season====
Following the departure of strike partner [[Fernando Torres]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the summer of 2007, Agüero secured his starting spot for the ''Rojiblancos'' and soon became arguably the team's most important player at the age of just 19. In the [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08 season]], he finished third highest scorer in [[La Liga]], behind [[Daniel Güiza]] and [[Luís Fabiano]], with 19 goals, and was runner up in the ''[[Trofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202736803447/noticia/Noticia/Raul_wins_the_Di_Stefano_Trophy.htm |publisher=Real Madrid |title=Marca names the Madridista captain the best player of the league |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630053840/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202736803447/noticia/Noticia/Raul_wins_the_Di_Stefano_Trophy.htm |archivedate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero won many plaudits for his [[man of the match]] display against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in March 2008, scoring twice, assisting a goal and winning a penalty for Atlético in a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/03/europeanfootball.barcelona |publisher=The Guardian |title=A masterclass from Atlético Madrid's Sergio Agüero dented Barcelona's title hopes and made several Catalan headline-writers look very foolish indeed |location=London |first=Sid |last=Lowe |date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sergio Aguero – Readers Q&amp;A |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384770.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored important goals against the likes of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] to help Atlético finish fourth and qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2008/May/12/atletico-de-madrid-confirm-return-to-europes-elite |title=Atletico de Madrid confirm return to Europe's elite |date=12 May 2008 |work=soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
Agüero was once again a regular goalscorer for Atlético in the [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09 season]], continuing to establish a lethal partnership with [[Uruguay]]an striker [[Diego Forlán]], also a former Independiente player. On 16 September, he scored his first Champions League goals in a 3–0 away win at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], helping Atlético eventually reach the last 16 of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3059895,00.html |title=PSV Eindhoven 0–3 Atlético Madrid |work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the duo of Forlán and Agüero scored a [[Brace (sports)#In other fields|brace]] each in a 4–3 win over league leaders Barcelona, the latter scoring the winning goal in the final minutes of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/03/01/spain.barcelona/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Atletico stun Barcelona as Real close up |accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of more vital goals in a formidable end of the season run-in from his team, Agüero finished in the top ten contenders for the [[Pichichi Trophy]], which was won by his teammate Forlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.eurosport.yahoo.com/01062009/15/uruguayo-forlan-gano-pichichi-bota-oro.html |publisher=Eurosport |title=El uruguayo Forlán ganó el 'pichichi' y la 'Bota de Oro' |language=Spanish |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710234709/http://es.eurosport.yahoo.com/01062009/15/uruguayo-forlan-gano-pichichi-bota-oro.html |archivedate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlético finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the following season's [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

====2009–10 season====
Despite not being as prolific in front of goal, Agüero had another good season in [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10]], and was praised for his influential performances as Atlético enjoyed their most successful season in over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marca.com/2010/04/07/futbol/equipos/atletico/1270634644.html |title=Quique Sánchez Flores and Diego Forlán prefer Sergio Agüero to Lionel Messi (Spanish) |publisher=Marca |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2009, he scored twice against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] during a 2–2 draw in the Champions League at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium|Vicente Calderón]].

On 27 August 2010, Atlético Madrid captured the [[2010 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] by beating favorites [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] 2–0. Agüero provided the assist for [[José Antonio Reyes]]' opening goal and then secured the win by scoring the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2010/08/27/2090098/atletico-madrid-goal-heroes-jose-antonio-reyes-kun-aguero-praise- |title=Atletico Madrid Goal Heroes José Antonio Reyes &amp; Kun Agüero Praise Team After Inter Win |publisher=Goal.com |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2011, Atlético Madrid confirmed via their official website that Agüero had signed a new contract with the club, keeping him at the Vicente Calderón until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11827_6634899,00.html |title=Agüero agrees Atlético stay |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was named as the new [[captain (association football)|vice-captain]] of Atlético, along with strike partner Diego Forlán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubatleticodemadrid.com/Web/noticia/template_noticia/noticia1.php?idnoticia=16703&amp;previo=1 |title=Agüero named Atlético vice-captain |publisher=Atlético Madrid Official website |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
[[File:Pepe y aguero.jpg|thumb|right|Agüero with Atlético Madrid during the [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]].]]
The [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]] was arguably Agüero's most successful for Atlético, as he scored 20 league goals for the first time in his career. Between March and May 2011, he went on a run of seven consecutive goalscoring appearances, a feat that no other player in Europe could match during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twitter.com/OptaJose/statuses/66921084271869952 |title=Agüero scores in seven consecutive matches |publisher=Opta (Twitter)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero's final outing for Atlético came on 21 May against [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]], a game in which he reached two [[milestone]]s. In a 4–3 win, he scored his first career [[hat-trick]], the second goal being his 100th for the ''Colchoneros''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/49221/mallorca-vs-atletico-madrid/report |title=RCD Mallorca 3–4 Atlético Madrid |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to celebrate any of the goals, however, led to speculation that he would be on his way out of the club.

On 23 May 2011, Agüero announced on his official website that he wanted to move from Atlético and formally asked to be released from his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/transfer_talk/72527/the-time-has-come-sergio-aguero-seeks-atletico-madrid-exit.html |title='The Time Has Come' – Sergio Aguero Asks Atletico Madrid to Tear Up His Contract » Who Ate all the Pies |publisher=Whoateallthepies.tv |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sergioaguero.com/notas.php?ID=298 |title=La Hora de Partir (Time to Leave) |publisher=Sergio Agüero Official website |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528234750/http://www.sergioaguero.com/notas.php?ID=298 |archivedate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero later spoke to [[ESPN]], where he stated that he would "not be returning to Atlético".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atleticofans.com/8365/aguero-i-will-not-be-returning-to-atletico/ |title=Agüero: "I will not be returning to Atlético" |publisher=Atleticofans.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day that Agüero officially became a [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] player, Atlético hosted a [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|2011–12 Europa League qualifier]] against [[Strømsgodset IF]], where a group of Atlético fans brandished "Agüero, We Hope You Die" banners in a reaction to the striker's transfer to City at the Vicente Calderón on 28 July 2011, after he had previously stated his desire to see out his contract with the club just weeks before requesting a transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peck |first=Brooks |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-tackle/post/atletico-fans-say-goodbye-to-aguero-by-wishing-death-upon-him?urn=sow-wp3756 |title=Atletico fans say goodbye to Aguero by wishing death upon him |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his departure, Atlético used the money from Agüero's sale to buy [[Radamel Falcao]] as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/atletico-madrid-use-aguero-cash-land-porto-star-falcao-1794881 |title=Atletico Madrid to use Aguero cash to land Porto star Falcao |publisher=tribalfootball.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five straight wins helped City wipe out the eight-point deficit against United, and they went into the final day's fixtures leading on goal difference. Facing relegation-threatened [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], City needed to match or better United's result at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. By the 66th minute, QPR's [[Joey Barton]] was sent off after elbowing Agüero's teammate, [[Carlos Tevez]] in the face. Eventually after being shown the red card, Barton proceeded to kick Agüero's knee, then attempted to attack [[Vincent Kompany]], only for him to be held back by Micah Richards. Despite that, QPR still went ahead 2–1 against City, while United were 1–0 up against Sunderland.

Five minutes of injury time began for City with their and United's match scores still constant. Džeko equalised for City for a glimmer of hope, but United soon finished their own game with a victory.

====2015–16 season====
On 7 August 2015, Agüero announced he would be switching from his number 16 shirt to the number 10 shirt, previously worn by teammate [[Edin Džeko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergio Aguero takes no.10 shirt for 15/16 |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2015/August/Aguero-takes-no-10-shirt-for-2015-16-shirt/1438948949 |publisher=Manchester City F.C.

During City's 2–0 victory away at Everton on 23 August, Agüero halted the game after noticing that an Everton supporter was in need of emergency treatment. The striker alerted the referee and the other players and made sure that the man received attention from the medics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-fans-9920485 |first=Chris |last=Slater |title=Sergio Aguero and Manchester City fans thanked for helping Everton supporter who collapsed in stand |work=Manchester Evening News |date=24 August 2015 |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September, Agüero earned and converted a last-minute penalty to give City a 2–1 win at [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage|Champions League group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jurejko |first1=Jonathan |title=Borussia Mönchengladbach 1–2 Man City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34394000 |accessdate=1 October 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October, Agüero scored five goals against Newcastle in a 6–1 comeback win, joining [[Andy Cole]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jermain Defoe]] and [[Dimitar Berbatov]] in scoring as many in a Premier League game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-city/story/2645709/sergio-aguero-matches-premier-league-record-with-five-goals |title=Man City's Sergio Aguero nets five goals to match Premier League record |date=October 2015 |accessdate=3 October 2015 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; His five goals within 23 minutes of game time made it the fastest five-goal haul since the Premier League started in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergio Aguero sets record for fastest-ever five-goal haul in Premier League |url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-city/story/2646493/sergio-aguero-sets-record-for-fastest-ever-five-goal-haul |publisher=ESPN |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |last=Jolly |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four minutes after scoring his fifth goal in the 62nd minute, Agüero was substituted by manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]], as he had been receiving treatment due to a leg injury at half time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergio Aguero scores five goals... and Manuel Pellegrini admits the Manchester City star played with a leg injury |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3258887/Sergio-Aguero-scores-five-Manchester-City-Manuel-Pellegrini-admits-played-hamstring-injury.html |last=Bernstein |first=Joe |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October, in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2018 World Cup qualifying match]] against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], Agüero sustained a hamstring injury early on and was carried off the pitch in tears. Agüero himself said he expected to be out for around four weeks (in which the derby against Manchester United was to be played), although several media outlets later claimed the injury would last for eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aguero confirms he will miss Manchester derby after suffering muscle tear |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-aguero-confirms-miss-manchester-6607749 |last=Richards |first=Alex |newspaper=The Mirror |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man City striker Sergio Aguero could miss eight weeks |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/10023469/manchester-city-striker-sergio-aguero-suffers-grade-two-tear |publisher=Sky Sports |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on 21 November, scoring in a 1–4 home loss to Liverpool; this was his 85th Premier League goal, making him the top-scoring South American of all time in the division, ahead of his compatriot and former strike partner Carlos Tevez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Darwin |first1=Stephen |title=Aguero overtakes Tevez to become highest-scoring South American in Premier League history |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2015/11/21/17564172/aguero-overtakes-tevez-to-become-highest-scoring-south |accessdate=22 November 2015 |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2016, Agüero scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win at Chelsea, ending with a penalty kick. He became the third visiting player to score a Premier League hat-trick at Stamford Bridge, and the fifth player to have three 20-goal seasons in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reddy |first1=Luke |title=Chelsea 0–3 Manchester City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36003978 |accessdate=16 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he scored his [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|100th Premier League]] goal in a 1–1 draw at Newcastle.

Agüero ended the [[2015–16 Premier League]] season with 24 goals, one behind Golden Boot winner [[Harry Kane]] and level with [[Jamie Vardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12028/10283818/tottenhams-harry-kane-clinches-premier-league-golden-boot |title=Tottenham's Harry Kane clinches Premier League Golden Boot |date=15 May 2016 |work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with his goals coming from 30 appearances, Agüero recorded the league's best goals to minute ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36081144 |title=Premier League top scorer: Harry Kane?

On 13 August 2016, Agüero scored Manchester City's first competitive goal under the management of [[Pep Guardiola]] in a 2–1 victory against Sunderland on the opening day of the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-centre/manchester-city-vs-sunderland-live-8195652 |title=Manchester City vs Sunderland live score and goal updates |last=Welch |first=Ben |date=13 August 2016|access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a league match against West Ham on 28 August, Agüero struck opponent [[Winston Reid]] in the throat with his arm, an incident which went unpunished by the referee. Reid lost his voice with the strike, and had to be substituted. The FA gave Agüero a three-match ban for violent conduct, accusing him of behaving in an "aggressive manner that was excessive in force and brutal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37363867 |title=Sergio Aguero: Foul on Winston Reid 'brutal and aggressive', says FA commission |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Sergio Agüero 2011-09-08 001.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo for [[Puma AG]], September 2011]]
Agüero was married to Gianinna Maradona, the youngest daughter of Argentine footballer [[Diego Maradona]]. On 19 February 2009, Gianinna gave birth to their son, Benjamín, in [[Madrid]]. Diego Maradona was there for the birth of his first grandson, while Agüero, then 20, missed Atlético's training session earlier in the day. Atlético offered their congratulations in a statement on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/02/19/soccer-maradona-idUKLJ7605820090219 |title=Maradona a grandfather thanks to Atletico's Aguero |date=19 February 2009 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=30 October 2015 |last=Elkington |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero and Gianinna separated in 2012 after four years together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Todd |last=Fitzgerald |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-citys-sergio-aguero-splits-1209630 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |title=Manchester City's Sergio Aguero splits from wife of four years |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agüero's nickname "Kun", which features on his shirt, dates back to his childhood. It was first given to him by his grandparents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2027348/Sergio-Aguero-use-Kun-Manchester-City-shirt.html |title=Yes you Kun!

He also has a tattoo on his left arm of his son's name and date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-aguero.htm |title=Sergio Agüero Tattoos |publisher=Vanishing Tattoo |accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero holds [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish nationality]], after being granted citizenship in 2010 whilst playing for [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11838/6551790/aguero-gains-eu-status |title=Aguero gains EU status |publisher=Sky Sports |date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agüero shares a close friendship with [[Lionel Messi]], his regular roommate during outings for the national team since 2005. He described Messi as being "like a brother" in his 2014 autobiography, ''Born to Rise'', which contains a foreword written by Messi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Ben |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29962472 |title=Sergio Aguero: Man City hero's journey from the 'cave of vipers' |date=8 November 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi is the godfather of Aguero's son Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maston |first=Tom |publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]] |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/4160/extra-time/2012/11/13/3525665/extra-time-aguero-delivers-gift-for-thiago-messi |title=Extra Time: Aguero delivers gift for Thiago Messi |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliaquim Hans Mangala''' (born 13 February 1991) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for English [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

Born in France, he moved to Belgium as a child and began his career there at [[Standard Liège]], going onto [[FC Porto|Porto]] in 2011 where he won consecutive [[Primeira Liga]] titles before joining Manchester City in 2014 for £32&amp;nbsp;million.

Mangala made his debut with the French national team on 6 June 2013 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was included in the nation's squads for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]], helping them to runners-up position in the latter.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mangala was born in the northwestern Parisian suburb of [[Colombes]] to Congolese parents, but moved to Belgium at the age of five to live in the French-speaking city of [[Namur]]. At the same age, he joined local club ''Athletic Club Lustin'' as a youth player and spent six years at the club before moving to ''CS Wépionnais'' in nearby [[Wépion]]. After two years in Wépion, Mangala joined the biggest club in the city, [[UR Namur]], and quickly impressed. While at Namur, Mangala was utilised as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] and his positive displays at youth level led to interest from [[Standard Liège]]. In 2007, Mangala and Standard reached an agreement on a three-year youth contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=32108 |website=Footgoal.net |title=Mangala a signé un contrat de cinq ans au Standard |language=French |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003091620/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=32108 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Liège===
Mangala joined Standard Liège and, upon his arrival, was converted into a [[left back]] and inserted into the club's under-17 team for the 2007–08 season. Mangala's admirable play with the team led to the player being promoted to Standard's under-19 team in January 2008, where he again switched positions, this time moving into [[defender (football)|central defence]]. During his time with the under-19 team, Mangala made the bench several times for Standard's under-21 team, despite being only 17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/genk/article/228529/titulaire-la-saison-prochaine.html |newspaper=La Dernière Heure |location=Brussels |title=Eliaquim Mangala a de l'ambition et du talent |language=French |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|2008–09 season]], Mangala was given the opportunity to train and play with the first team. On 23 October 2008, he signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a five-year deal with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=32124 |website=Footgoal.net |title=Mangala: Je ne réalise pas encore |language=French |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034944/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=32124 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mangala was officially promoted to the senior team and assigned the number 22 shirt. On 9 November, he made his professional debut as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–1 victory over [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standard.be/fr/c_match.php?id=3451 |publisher=Standard Liège |title=Germinal Beerschot 1–3 Standard de Liège |language=French |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507011654/http://www.standard.be/fr/c_match.php?id=3451 |archivedate=7 May 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made another late appearance against [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] before earning his first career league start against [[F.C. Verbroedering Dender E.H.|Dender]] on 17 January 2009. In the match, Mangala provided the assist on the opening goal scored by [[Milan Jovanović (footballer, born 1981)|Milan Jovanović]] in the 3rd minute of play. Standard won the match 3–2 with Mangala playing the entire match. He finished the season with 11 league appearances as Standard Liège were crowned champions. He also appeared in [[UEFA Cup]] matches against Italian club [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], German club [[VfB Stuttgart|Stuttgart]], and Portuguese team [[Sporting CP]], starting the match against the latter.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Mangala was inserted as a starter for the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League|2009–10 season]] making his debut in the club's 2–0 victory over [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]] in the [[2009 Belgian Super Cup|Belgian Supercup]] on 25 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bel/news/newsid=864074.html |title=Standard triumph in Belgian Super Cup |publisher=UEFA |date=25 July 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September, Mangala scored his first professional goal in a league match against [[KV Mechelen|Mechelen]] in a 3–0 victory. Four days later, Mangala scored another goal against English club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the club's opening [[2009-10 UEFA Champions League|UEFA
 Champions League]] group stage match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000028/match=2000371/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Arsenal fightback flattens Standard |publisher=UEFA |date=12 September 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mangala scored the goal in the 3rd minute and Standard striker Jovanović scored two minutes later to put Standard Liège up 2–0, however, the club went on to lose the match 3–2 following three unanswered goals from the English team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8254473.stm |title=Standard Liège 2–3 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what proved to be his final league match for Standard, Mangala converted a [[Steven Defour]] free-kick to give his team a 1–0 lead over [[KRC Genk]] at half-time, but striker [[Kennedy Ugoala Nwanganga]] earned a 1–1 draw for Genk, securing the league title by just half a point over Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bel/news/newsid=1632291.html |title=Genk pip Standard to Belgian title |publisher=UEFA |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final appearance for the club on 21 May 2011, Mangala scored Standard's first goal in their 2–0 victory over [[K.V.C. Westerlo]] in the [[2011 Belgian Cup Final|final]] of the [[2010–11 Belgian Cup|Belgian Cup]], ending an 18-year cup drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bel/news/newsid=1633343.html |title=Standard end 18-year Belgian Cup wait |publisher=UEFA |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto===

He made his first appearance in the [[2012–13 FC Porto season|2012–13 season]] for Porto in the [[2012 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira]] against [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica]] on 11 August 2012, playing the full 90 minutes as Porto won the pre-season title with a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dragões conquistam Supertaça ao bater Académica com golo de Martínez|trans-title=Dragons win SuperCup by beating Académica with a goal from Martínez |url=http://www.abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=346792 |newspaper=A Bola |location=Lisbon |accessdate=1 September 2012 |date=11 August 2012 |language=Portuguese |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FfviDaEg?url=http://www.abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=346792 |archivedate=6 April 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first-team breakthrough with Porto that season, becoming the first-choice [[centre back]] and scoring four league goals, one of which was in a 2–2 draw with Benfica on 13 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mangala demolidor|trans-title=Mangala at his best |url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/fc-porto/detalhe/mangala-demolidor-798964.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |newspaper=Record |location=Lisbon |date=15 January 2013 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mangala featured in Porto's 2–0 win over [[Paços de Ferreira]] on 19 May 2013, leading the club to an undefeated season and a third-straight league title, by just one point over rivals [[S.L.

On 23 February 2014, Mangala was sent off for a reckless challenge inside the area and Porto fell to a 1–0 defeat to [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril]] as [[Evandro Goebel|Evandro]] converted the spot kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/02/23/portugal/portuguese-liga-/futebol-clube-do-porto/gd-estoril-praia/1511856/ |title=Porto vs. Estoril 0–1 |website=Soccerway |publisher=Perform Group |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Porto's [[2013-14 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] Round of 16-second leg against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] on 27 February 2014, Mangala scored two goals, both from headers, as Porto battled back from 2–0 down to draw 3–3 and secure passage to the quarter-finals on away goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/306108/report |title=Europa League: Porto prevail in 3–3 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 February 2014 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2014, Mangala headed in the game's only goal as Porto defeated [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the first-leg of their quarter-final tie in the Europa League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000472/match=2012671/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Mangala swoops to earn Porto victory over Sevilla |publisher=UEFA |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal would not be enough to guide the Portuguese into the next round as they fell to a 4–1 loss in Spain seven days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000472/match=2012675/postmatch/report/ |title=Sevilla surge past Porto and into semis |publisher=UEFA |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
[[File:Eliaquim Mangala 69783.jpg|thumb|upright|Mangala playing for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2014]]

On 11 August 2014, Mangala signed for English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on a five-year contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eliaquim Mangala signs for City |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/NewsNewsandFeatures/Team-news/2014/August/Eliaquim-Mangala-signs-for-Manchester-City-FC |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |accessdate=11 August 2014 |date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a reported £31.8&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=De Menezes |first1=Jack |title=Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City: Premier League champions hoping to tie up £32m transfer this weekend |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/eliaquim-mangala-to-manchester-city-premier-league-champions-hoping-to-tie-up-32m-transfer-this-weekend-9654435.html |accessdate=11 August 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jolly |first1=Richard |title=Pellegrini hopeful of Mangala deal |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1980650/manchester-city-boss-manuel-pellegrini-hopeful-of-eliaquim-mangala-deal |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=11 August 2014 |date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however reported 18 months into his contract that the fee was more in the region of £42m due to spiralling costs as a result of Mangala's split ownership at Porto, with City having to pay in the region of £18m to two companies which owned over 40% of Mangala's economic rights. This second figure would have made Mangala the most expensive defender in British transfer history at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pollard |first1=Rob |title=Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala cost over £40m, a leaked document has confirmed |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-city-defender-eliaquim-mangala-10764233 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=21 January 2016 |date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reunited with his former partner in Porto's defence, [[Fernando (Brazilian footballer, born 1987)|Fernando]], who had joined City earlier in the summer.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Mangala made his debut in City's fifth match of the [[Premier League]] season, a 1–1 home draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 21 September. Lining up alongside captain [[Vincent Kompany]], his performance was described by [[BBC Sport]] as "colossal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Man City 1–1 Chelsea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29196082 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, an own goal and concession of a penalty by Mangala caused City to lose a 2–0 lead against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], although they eventually triumphed 4–2. Despite media criticism, manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] said "we continue to trust him because he is a very good player who had very bad luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keegan |first1=Mike |title=Hull 2–4 Man City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289927 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November, Mangala was sent off for two yellow cards in City's 3–0 win away to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jurejko |first1=Jonathan |title=Southampton 0–3 Man City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30166197 |accessdate=30 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valencia (loan)====
On 31 August 2016, Mangala joined Spanish club [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/2016/08/31/eliaquim-mangala-joins-valencia-on-loan/1472633027775 |title=Mangala moves to Valencia on loan |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the ''Che'' on 11 September, starting alongside fellow newcomer [[Ezequiel Garay]] in a 3–2 home loss to [[Real Betis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final de traca en Mestalla |url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2016_17/la-liga/jornada_3/val_bet/ |newspaper=Marca |location=Madrid |accessdate=5 September 2017 |date=11 September 2016 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 2017, he scored his first goal to defeat [[CD Leganés|Leganés]] at [[Mestalla]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La Liga round-up: Eliaquim Mangala nets rare goal in Valencia win |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/10785892/la-liga-round-up-eliaquim-mangala-nets-rare-goal-in-valencia-win |accessdate=5 September 2017 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 19 March he headed the opening goal of a 4–2 away loss at [[FC Barcelona]] in which he was sent off for pulling at [[Luis Suárez]] in the penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Creek |first1=Stephen |title=BARCELONA 4 VALENCIA 2: MESSI DOUBLE HELPS TO SEE OFF 10-MAN VALENCIA |url=http://www.goal.com/en-in/match/barcelona-v-valencia/9hsq6m3qf2i3q60jap4x1hg4p |accessdate=5 September 2017 |website=Goal.com |publisher=Perform Group |date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Everton (loan)====
Mangala joined Premier League club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan on 31 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eliaquim Mangala: Everton sign Manchester City defender on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42897518 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 February 2018 |date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] but was forced off at half-time with a knee injury. He later underwent surgery and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/loan-everton-defender-eliaquim-mangala-14351465 |title=On-loan Everton defender Eliaquim Mangala undergoes successful knee surgery |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |last=Gorst |first=Paul |date=28 February 2018 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Néry, Ahamada, and Mangala.jpg|thumb|upright|Mangala lining up as the captain of [[France national under-21 football team|France U21]] in 2011]]

Due to being raised in Belgium, Mangala did not feature with any of [[France national youth football team|France's youth football teams]]. In 2008, he was approached by the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] who called the player up to the country's under-18 national team. However, due to not possessing a passport at the time, the call up was deemed futile. After excelling with Standard Liège's senior team, Mangala drew the interest of the [[French Football Federation]] with [[France national under-21 football team|France under-21]] manager [[Erick Mombaerts]] attending a match between Liège and [[R.E. Mouscron|Mouscron]] at the [[Stade Le Canonnier]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/espoirs/actualite/531061.shtml |publisher=French Football Federation |title=Angleterre et Belgique |language=French |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 2009, Mangala was selected, for the first time, to the under-21 team for a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] match against [[Tunisia national under-21 football team|Tunisia]] on 13 November and a [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification]] match against [[Slovenia national under-21 football team|Slovenia]] on 17 November. Mangala made his under-21 debut in the Tunisia match, but missed the match against Slovenia after withdrawing from the team due to an injury suffered the previous day in training. On 2 March 2010, he earned his second straight selection to the under-21 team and started in central defence alongside [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Mamadou Sakho]] in the team's 3–1 win over [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Mangala made his debut with the [[France national football team|France senior team]] in a 1–0 loss to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] on 6 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eliaquim-mangala.com/en/component/content/article/28-mangala/137-france-under-21s-career |title=France career |accessdate=13 July 2014 |website=Eliaquim Mangala |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235421/http://www.eliaquim-mangala.com/en/component/content/article/28-mangala/137-france-under-21s-career |archivedate=23 September 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in France's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] but did not make an appearance during the tournament, in which ''Les Bleus'' reached the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eliaquim-mangala.com/en/component/content/article/28-mangala/137-france-under-21s-career |title=Eliaquim Mangala: Man City in advanced talks for Porto defender |date=12 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |website=Eliaquim Mangala |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235421/http://www.eliaquim-mangala.com/en/component/content/article/28-mangala/137-france-under-21s-career |archivedate=23 September 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangala was also included in France's squad that finished runners-up at [[UEFA Euro 2016]] on home soil. He made one appearance in the quarter-finals on 3 July, replacing [[Laurent Koscielny]] for the final 18 minutes of a 5–2 win over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] at the [[Stade de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fletcher |first1=Paul |title=France 5–2 Iceland |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36632457 |accessdate=5 September 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often described by pundits as one of the best and most complete modern day [[Playmaker|advanced playmakers]], due to his technique, skill, athleticism, work-rate off the ball, vision, wide range of passing, and powerful long-range shooting ability with either foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squawka.com/news/do-manchester-city-need-kevin-de-bruyne-this-summer/395150|title=Do Manchester City need Kevin De Bruyne this summer?|publisher=Squawka|date=11 June 2015|access-date=16 November 2017|first=Daniel|last=Anwar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/11833859/Kevin-De-Bruyne-completes-54m-Man-City-transfer.html|title=Kevin De Bruyne completes £54m Man City transfer|work=The Daily Telegraph|author1=Mark Ogden|author2=Mike Whalley|date=30 August 2015|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/686309 |title=De Bruyne the drive behind Man City success |publisher=Premier League |author1=Adrian Clarke |date=11 May 2018 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-vs-manchester-city-kevin-de-bruyne-perfect-complete-guardiola-conte-reaction-a7976051.html |title=Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte laud Kevin De Bruyne for being the perfect 'complete' player after masterclass |publisher=The Independent |author1=Miguel Delaney |date=30 September 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/de-bruyne-s-versatility-a-key-for-belgium-1.1134678 |title=De Bruyne's versatility a key for Belgium |publisher=TSN |date=9 July 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is not blessed with significant physical strength, pace, or ability in the air,&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/3785/generazione-di-fenomeni/2011/11/16/2756464/generazione-di-fenomeni-kevin-de-bruyne-il-gioiello-del-genk-che- |title=Generazione di Fenomeni - Kevin De Bruyne, il gioiello del Genk che il Chelsea sta corteggiando da anni... |publisher=Goal.com |language=Italian |author1=Simone Gambino |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he is a quick and elegant player on the ball, with good [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, while his positional sense, tactical intelligence, movement, direct style of play, and ability to run at defences when in possession also enable him to take advantage of spaces in the opposition's defence, and subsequently create chances and goalscoring opportunities for himself or his teammates, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2017-2018/soccer-de-bruyne-performance-leaves-guardiola-speechless_sto6446741/story.shtml |title=Kevin De Bruyne performance leaves Pep Guardiola speechless |publisher=Eurosport |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/09/22/kevin-de-bruyne-is-one-of-best-players-ive-worked-with-says-pep/ |title=Kevin De Bruyne 'is one of best players I've worked with' says Pep Guardiola - but what makes him so special? |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=JJ Bull |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vivoperlei.calciomercato.com/articolo/dopo-messi-e-cr7-a-chi-il-pallone-doro?referral=vxl_box_mobile |title=Dopo Messi e Cr7 a chi il pallone d'Oro? |publisher=Calciomercato |language=Italian |author1=Ammiraglio Byrd |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his creative abilities,&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt; he is also capable of scoring goals by making late runs off the ball from behind into the penalty area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/14802/uefacom/2016/06/08/24370292/pogba-de-bruyne-e-i-migliori-centrocampisti-di-uefa-euro |title=Pogba, De Bruyne e i migliori centrocampisti di UEFA EURO 2016 |publisher=Goal.com |language=Italian |date=8 June 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an accurate [[Direct free kick|set-piece]] taker.&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/goals-assists-set-pieces-stats-172816108.html |title=Goals, assists, set-pieces - The stats that show De Bruyne is almost irreplaceable for City |publisher=Yahoo |date=15 August 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 De Bruyne bought his first car, a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], having previously relied on club vehicles, in preparation for the birth of his first child.&lt;ref name=northcroft&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Northcroft |title=City Whizzkid |newspaper=''[[The Sunday Times]]'' |date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, entitled ''Keep It Simple'', was published by Borgerhoff &amp; Lamberigts in October 2014.&lt;ref name=northcroft/&gt;

De Bruyne was an ambassador for the 2014 [[Special Olympics]], which took place in [[Antwerp]] and was involved in a controversial advertisement campaign, via his personal [[Instagram]] account. Employing the slogan (in [[Flemish]]): "Would you still be my fan if I looked like this?", De Bruyne was depicted resembling a person with [[Down syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccerly.com/article/dflores/kevin-de-bruynes-controversial-special-olympics-campaign|title=Kevin de Bruyne's controversial Special Olympics campaign|first=David Flores -|last=dflores|website=Soccerly|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, Fernando, is [[Spaniards|Spanish]] (Canarian) while his mother, Eva, is of Japanese descent, claimed by the Canarian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Silva, el nieto de 'la tirajanera' |url=http://www.laprovincia.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008063000_1_160807__Portada-Las-Palmas-David-Silva-nieto-tirajanera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1290896/Manchester-City-new-boy-David-Silva-Prada-wearing-machete-fighter-started-life-goal.html |title=Manchester City new boy David Silva: The Prada-wearing Japanese machete fighter who started life in goal... |newspaper=Daily Mail |first1=Max |last1=Lakey |first2=Josh |last2=Taylor |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva began playing football in the youth team of UD San Fernando, near [[Maspalomas]]. Originally, he played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], before becoming a [[Winger (association football)|winger]]&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{Cite news |title=David Silva: From a childhood in a Spanish fishing village to Premier League superstar... |last=Kay |first=Alex |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2051589/David-Silva-From-Spanish-fishing-village-Premier-League-superstar.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mirrored his game around his footballing idol as a youth, [[Michael Laudrup]].&lt;ref name="career"/&gt; When he was 14, he received an offer to become a youth player at [[Valencia CF]], which he accepted. He stayed in Valencia's youth set-up until he was 17.

==Club career==
===Valencia===
[[File:David Silva vs Newcastle.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Silva playing for Valencia]]
A product of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]'s youth system, Silva made his professional debut in [[2004–05 Segunda División|2004–05]], with [[Segunda División]]'s [[SD Eibar|Eibar]], while on loan from Valencia, playing 35 league games and scoring on five occasions. In the [[2005–06 La Liga|following season]], he was again out on loan, this time to [[Celta de Vigo]], where he played 34 matches, scoring four goals. After two late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] appearances, the first in a 2–0 home win over [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] on 28 August 2005, Silva finished as an undisputed starter as the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] side reached the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] straight from the second-tier.

Silva returned to Valencia in the summer of 2006, becoming an automatic first-choice despite his young age of 20. In two seasons combined, he only missed six matches and netted 14 goals, his first league goal coming on 5 November 2006 in a 1–1 draw at [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]]. In August 2008, he extended his contract by five years, amidst interest of several [[Premier League]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7559788.stm |title=Silva opts to stay with Valencia |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[2007–08 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey 2008]], his first title in [[Spain]].

After not appearing in the first three months of [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09]] due to a chronic [[ankle]] ailment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=748802.html |title=Silva resigned to three-month absence |publisher=UEFA |date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva returned to the call-ups in mid-December. On 3 January 2009, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over [[Atlético Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=790351.html |title=Barça stride on, Silva inspires Valencia |publisher=UEFA |date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; still contributing with 19 matches (four goals) as the ''Che'' qualified for the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].

In the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]], Silva scored a career-best eight goals, as Valencia finished in third position and [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|returned]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. On 15 April 2010, he scored a brace against [[Athletic Bilbao]] for a 2–0 home win,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2009_10/primera/jornada_32/val_ath/ La Champions es más fácil con Silva (Champions League is easier with Silva)]; [[Diario Marca]], 15 April 2010 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding three assists in the 4–4 thriller at [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] for the Europa League's [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|round of 16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000039/match=2000954/postmatch/quotes/index.html |title=Villa revels in Valencia's 'crazy' night |publisher=UEFA |first=Trevor |last=Huggins |date=18 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322194435/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season%3D2010/round%3D2000039/match%3D2000954/postmatch/quotes/index.html |archivedate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
====2010–11====
[[File:David Silva.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Silva with Manchester City in April 2011]]
On 30 June 2010, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] announced that they had reached an agreement with Valencia over the transfer of Silva and that he would join the club on a four-year deal, prior to the start of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6238493,00.html City clinch Silva deal]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926004450/http://www.skysports.com/story/0%2C19528%2C11661_6238493%2C00.html |date=26 September 2015 }}; [[Sky Sports]], 30 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, the Premier League side completed the signing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/808743/new-manchester-city-boy-david-silva-targets-champions-league |title=New City boy Silva targets Champions League |publisher=ESPN FC |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silva was awarded the number 21 shirt, the same number he wore for Valencia and when playing for [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

On 2 March, he scored from 20 yards out in an [[FA Cup]] win (3–0) against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Three days later, he scored the only goal in Manchester City's win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Silva netted the third goal in City's 5–0 rout of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 3 April.

In the first [[Manchester Derby]] of the season at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester City won 6–1, with Silva proving, yet again, to be instrumental in the Manchester City attack, scoring the fifth goal, setting up Edin Džeko's second with a chested volley pass through the United defense, and participating in the first two goals with excellent passing to [[James Milner]] to assist [[Mario Balotelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/117650.html |title=Triple Dutch |publisher=ESPN |first=Chris |last=Murphy |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2011, in an interview with a Spanish radio station, Silva revealed that he turned down [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] so he could sign for City, and that he wants to stay at the club for years.

In the opening match of the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]] season, in a 0–3 win at [[West Bromich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], Silva delivered a performance his manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] labelled "unbelievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/it-was-an-unbelievable-performance-from-david-silva-says-manchester-city-manager-manuel-pellegrini/ |title=It was an unbelievable performance from David Silva, says Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini |work=[[Indian Express]] |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as assisting the team's third goal, Silva was later credited with the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-city/story/2562014/david-silva-credited-with-scoring-man-citys-first-goal |title=David Silva credited with scoring Man City's first goal rather than Yaya Toure |publisher=ESPN FC |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After contributing another three assists for the team in August (in wins against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33839794 |title=Manchester City 3–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=16 August 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34025307 |title=Manchester City 2–0 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Chris |last=Bevan |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva was nominated for both of the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Premier League Player of the Month]] Awards for August, winning the former.&lt;ref name="Aug15POTM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2015/September/David-Silva-is-Etihad-Player-of-the-Month-for-August-2015/1442575826 |title=Silva voted Etihad Player of the Month |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919232349/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2015/September/David-Silva-is-Etihad-Player-of-the-Month-for-August-2015/1442575826 |archivedate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34216391 |title=Andre Ayew &amp; Manuel Pellegrini win Premier League awards |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:David Silva and Leonardo Bonucci Euro 2012 final.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Silva (left) on the ball for Spain in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final]]]]
Silva first represented Spain in the [[2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in [[Finland]], scoring three goals. In 2006, he became an [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21 international]] and scored four goals during the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]; this was enough to earn him joint-fourth place in the goal ranking, alongside Italian [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Graziano Pellè]].

Silva made his [[Spain national football team|senior international]] debut in the 1–0 friendly home defeat to [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 15 November 2006, and continued to receive call-ups to the side after good contributions in his first games. On 22 August 2007, he scored his first two goals for Spain, netting twice in a 3–2 friendly win versus [[Greece national football team|Greece]], and was then called up to the squad of 23 for [[UEFA Euro 2008]].

In the semi-finals game versus [[Russia national football team|Russia]], Silva scored the third goal for Spain after a quick counter-attack in which [[Cesc Fàbregas]] delivered a low cross, and he sent the ball into [[Igor Akinfeev]]'s goal with his left foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=301698/index.html Clinical Spain set up Germany final date]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911200335/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match%3D301698/index.html |date=11 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|the final]], he was involved in an incident with [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s [[Lukas Podolski]]. After he pulled Podolski to the ground, the German approached Silva, which resulted in an angry exchange of words and a coming together of heads that the referee decided not to punish. Shortly afterward, Spanish coach [[Luis Aragonés]] substituted Silva for [[Santi Cazorla]] in an attempt to calm the tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7363545.stm |title=Germany 0–1 Spain |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=29 June 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing regularly during [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification]] – Spain won all ten fixtures – Silva was also picked for the squad for the finals in [[South Africa]]. His participation was, however, a small one, as the national team won the tournament: he started in the first match, a 0–1 group stage defeat against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], then played the last four minutes of the 1–0 win against Germany in the semi-finals.

On 11 August 2010, during an international friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], Silva scored two minutes into second-half injury time, ending the game with a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=290887&amp;league=FIFA.FRIENDLY&amp;cc=5739 |title=Silva salvages draw for Spain |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifier]] against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] on 3 September 2010, Silva scored after 62 minutes, in a 4–0 away win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=299308&amp;cc=4716 Torres grabs brace for Spain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907044308/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=299308&amp;cc=4716 |date=7 September 2010 }}; ESPNsoccernet, 3 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, in the same competition, he scored through a rare header, as the national team downed [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] in [[Salamanca]] (3–1).

In a friendly against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] on 9 February 2011, he came off the bench to score the game's only goal with just four minutes remaining, helping Spain to a hard-fought 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/57279/spain-vs-colombia/report |title=Spain 1–0 Colombia: Substitute David Silva grabs late winner to save lacklustre world champions |work=Goal.com |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice and provided one assist in Spain's 3–1 victory against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in their final match of the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifiers]].

Heading into Euro 2012, he scored in their pre-tournament friendly against [[China football team|China]] by finishing off a short give and go from [[Andrés Iniesta]] in the 84th minute.

Silva was a starter in all six matches of Spain's Euro 2012 campaign. In the 14th minute of the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|Euro 2012 Final]], he headed home a Cesc Fàbregas cross, giving Spain a 1–0 lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/346764/report.html?=dsf |title=Spain claim historic win |date=1 July 2012 |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115231727/http://espnfc.com/en/report/346764/report.html?=dsf |archivedate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The match ended 4–0 and concluded the tournament in which Silva scored two goals and made three assists, the best efficiency (goals and assists) of any player at the Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/records/index/league/uefa-euro/season/2012/statsnrecords.html |title=Stats &amp; Records |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615173808/http://www.espnfc.com/en/records/index/league/uefa-euro/season/2012/statsnrecords.html |archivedate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently named in UEFA's Euro 2012 Team of the Tournament for his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA EURO 2012 Team of the Tournament |url=http://www.uefa.org/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=1838241.html?rss=1838241+UEFA+EURO+2012+Team+of+the+Tournament |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=3 February 2014 |date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Silva 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|Silva represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.]]

Silva was named in Vicente del Bosque's 23-man squad list for Spain's contestation of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], held in Brazil. On 20 June 2013, he scored two goals in Spain's 10–0 [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Group B|group stage]] demolition of [[Tahiti national football team|Tahiti]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/365339/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |title=Torres' 4 goals inspire Spanish rout |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being part of Spain's consecutive unsuccessful campaigns at [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Silva continued his goal scoring record under new boss Julen Lopetegui, scoring 9 times in 12 matches.{{citation needed|date= June 2017}} In May 2018 Silva was named to Spain's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;(Simpson, Christopher) [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2777080-david-de-gea-isco-headline-spains-full-2018-world-cup-provisional-squad-roster David De Gea, Isco Headline Spain's Full 2018 World Cup Provisional Squad Roster] ''Bleacher Report''.

After the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] Silva announced his retirement from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45176114 |title=David Silva: Manchester City's Spain midfielder retires from international football |accessdate=21 November 2018 |date=13 August 2018 |publisher=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Mendy''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛ̃.ʒa.mɛ̃ mɑ̃.di}}; born 17 July 1994) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[France national football team|French national team]].

After coming through [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]]'s youth academy, Mendy began his playing career with the club's reserve side in 2010, eventually being promoted to the first team a year later. He remained with the club until 2013, when he joined [[Ligue 1]] side [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. Mendy spent the next three seasons with ''Les Olympiens'' before leaving for [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], with whom he won the [[List of Ligue 1 champions|national championship]] in [[2016–17 Ligue 1|2016–17]]. In the summer of 2017, Mendy moved to the English club Manchester City on a then world-record transfer fee for a defender. He subsequently won the Premier League in [[2017–18 Manchester City F.C. season|his first season]] in England.

Mendy made his senior debut for France in 2017 after previously being [[Cap (sport)|capped]] by [[France national youth football team|France youth teams]] at [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[France national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels. He was chosen in France's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] which they won.

==Club career==
===Le Havre===
On 24 July 2011, Mendy signed his first professional contract,  a three-year contract with [[Ligue 2]] club [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hac-foot.com/actualite/benjamin-mendy-signe-pro-pour-3-saisons.html | title = Benjamin Mendy signe pro pour 3 saisons | date = 24 July 2011 | work = [[Le Havre AC]] | accessdate = 9 August 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy made his professional debut on 9 August 2011 in the team's 2–1 [[2011–12 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] second round defeat to [[Amiens SC|Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amiens v.

===Marseille===
On 8 July 2013, Mendy signed for [[Ligue 1]] side [[Olympique de Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transfer news: Marseille agree deal for Sunderland target Benjamin Mendy|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11695/8814061/transfer-news-marseille-agree-deal-for-sunderland-target-benjamin-mendy|website=Sky Sports|date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy was signed by manager [[Élie Baup]], who led Marseille to a second place finish and qualification for the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League]] in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africatopsports.com/2013/07/13/elie-baup-benjamin-mendy-est-un-joueur-davenir/ |title=ELIE BAUP : " BENJAMIN MENDY EST UN JOUEUR D'AVENIR " |work=Africa Top Sports |first=Isidore |last=Akouete |date=13 July 2013 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his club and Ligue 1 debut on 11 August against [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]], and scored his first goal for Marseille on 24 September against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]]. Mendy was in the squad for all six [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League#Group stage|group stage]] matches, and made his European debut on 1 October at [[Borussia Dortmund]]. However, Marseille lost all their group stage matches while falling out of the competition, and Baup was sacked in favor of former club manager [[José Anigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/25282768 |title=Elie Baup sacked as Marseille manager |work=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy was sparingly used toward the end of the season by Anigo, and made just one start in Marseille's final fourteen games. His performance in the start, against [[Lille OSC|Lille]] on 20 April 2014, was criticized by former Marseille left-back [[Éric Di Meco]], who claimed he would "eat a rat" if Mendy ever made the [[France national football team|French national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lephoceen.fr/infos-om/decla/di-meco-prend-les-paris-contre-mendy-l-ancien-defenseur-marseillais-tacle-benjamin-mendy-125264 |title=Di Meco prend les paris contre Mendy |work=Le Phocéen |date=22 April 2014 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Mendy was included on the 40-man shortlist for the 2014 [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/30/five-english-players-shortlist-golden-boy |title=Five English players on 40-man shortlist for Golden Boy award |work=The Guardian |first=Ed |last=Aarons |date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendy developed his game the following season under Argentinian manager [[Marcelo Bielsa]], as Mendy claimed Bielsa had "given back to him the strength and aggressiveness lost last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/sports/benjamin-mendy-en-toute-insouciance-20-12-2014-4388823.php |title=Benjamin Mendy en toute insouciance |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date=20 December 2014 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy made 33 starts in the league in the [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15]] campaign, getting 6 assists as well as Marseille qualified for the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League#Group stage|Europa League]]. On 23 September 2015, Mendy was shown a straight red card shortly after coming on as a substitute against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]], after he committed a professional foul on Toulouse's [[Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/report?gameId=424679 |title=Toulouse 1-1 Marseille |work=ESPN FC |author=PA Sport |date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy would be given a two-match ban, and later missed a further 13 games for Marseille after picking up a hamstring injury against [[SM Caen|Caen]] in the [[2015–16 Coupe de France#Round of 64|Coupe de France]] on 3 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/mendy-joins-om-injury-list.htm |title=MENDY JOINS OM INJURY LIST |work=Ligue 1 |date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendy played for five different managers in three seasons at the [[Stade Vélodrome]]. He made 101 competitive appearances with the club and had 14 assists to his name.

===Monaco===
On 22 June 2016, Olympique de Marseille's Ligue 1 rivals [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] announced that they had signed Mendy on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benjamin Mendy signs on a five-year contract|url=http://www.asmonaco.com/en/article/benjamin-mendy-signs-on-a-five-year-contract-7293.html|website=AS Monaco|date=22 June 2016 |accessdate=22 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy made his debut for the club in the first leg of the Champions League [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|third round]] against Turkish side [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] on 27 July. On 18 December against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in Ligue 1, Mendy was shown a red card for kicking at the backside of Lyon midfielder [[Corentin Tolisso]]. This was his second dismissal of the season after he was sent off in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League#Play-off round|play-off round]] of the Champions League against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4046616/Monaco-1-3-Lyon-Benjamin-Mendy-sees-red-Alexandre-Lacazette-caps-fine-away-win-Principality.html |title=Monaco 1-3 Lyon: Benjamin Mendy sees red as Alexandre Lacazette caps fine away win in the Principality |work=Daily Mail |first=Ben |last=Grounds |date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/1634245/mendy-says-sorry-after-being-sent-off-in-monacos-champions-league-play-off-first-leg-victory-2-1-against-villarreal/ |title=Mendy says 'sorry' after being sent off in Monaco's Champions League play-off first leg victory (2-1) against Villarreal |work=The Sun |first=Dylan |last=Legrand |date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy was banned five matches for the incident, later reduced to four as he made his return against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] on 22 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-france-mon-mendy/as-monaco-defender-mendy-banned-for-five-matches-idUKKBN14C1O0 |title=AS Monaco defender Mendy banned for five matches |work=Reuters |first=Silvia |last=Recchimuzzi |date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Benjamin-mendy-de-retour-de-suspension-avec-monaco/770940 |title=Benjamin Mendy de retour de suspension avec Monaco |work=[[L'Équipe]] |date=21 January 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February, Mendy [[assist (football)|assisted]] two of Monaco's goals by [[cross (football)|crossing]] the ball to the scorers [[Valère Germain]] and [[Radamel Falcao]] in their 3–0 Ligue 1 home win over [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/falcao-at-the-double-as-monaco-power-on.htm|title=Falcao at the double as Monaco power on|date=4 February 2017|work=www.ligue1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy scored his first goal for Monaco in the [[2016–17 Coupe de France#Round of 16|Coupe de France]] against former club Marseille on 1 March. The goal, scored in extra time, gave Monaco a 3–2 lead, as Mendy also provided two assists in the 4–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/coupe-de-france/2016-2017/monaco-down-marseille-in-french-cup-thriller-psg-through_sto6077251/story.shtml |title=Monaco down Marseille in French Cup thriller, PSG through |work=Eurosport |author=Reuters |date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monaco made a run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, and Mendy provided 4 assists in the campaign before they were eliminated by [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

Mendy was a key part of Monaco's [[2016–17 Ligue 1]] championship season, making 24 starts in the league for ''Les Monégasques'' under manager [[Leonardo Jardim]]. Monaco scored a league-leading 107 goals during the season, and Mendy was noted along with fellow [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] [[Djibril Sidibé (footballer, born 1992)|Djibril Sidibe]] for their forward play.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-france-amo-ste/monaco-claim-first-title-in-17-years-with-st-etienne-win-idUKKCN18D2ON |title=Monaco claim first title in 17 years with St Etienne win |work=Reuters |first=Julien |last=Pretot |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2707470-monaco-win-2016-17-ligue-1-title-after-2-0-win-vs-saint-etienne |title=Monaco Win 2016-17 Ligue 1 Title After 2-0 Win vs. Saint-Etienne |work=Bleacher Report |first=Matt |last=Jones |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May, Mendy was named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football|2017 UNFP Team of the Year]], along with 5 of his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://frenchfootballdaily.com/2017/05/ligue-1-team-of-the-season-2016-17-official-unfp-team-of-the-year-2017/ |title=Ligue 1 Team of the Season 2016-17 Official- UNFP Team of the Year 2017 |work=French Football Daily |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Monaco clinched the Ligue 1 title against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] on the penultimate day of the season, their first in 17 seasons in what would be Mendy's final game with the club.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; After the season, Mendy was part of the exodus away from the [[Stade Louis II]] that included starlets [[Bernardo Silva]], [[Tiemoué Bakayoko]], and later [[Kylian Mbappé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/25/monaco-benjamin-mendy-tiemoue-bakayoko-bernardo-silva-ligue-1 |title=How will Monaco cope after losing so many of their title-winning stars? |work=The Guardian |first=Eric |last=Devin |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/3190925/kylian-mbappe-signs-for-paris-saint-germain-from-monaco |title=Monaco star Kylian Mbappe, 18, follows Neymar in moving to PSG in huge deal |work=ESPN FC |first=Jonathan |last=Johnson |date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riyad Karim Mahrez''' ({{lang-ar|رياض كريم محرز}}; born 21 February 1991) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]].

Mahrez began his career as a youth player for French club AAS Sarcelles. He turned professional in 2009 with [[Quimper Kerfeunteun F.C.|Quimper]], where he played for only one season before moving to [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], spending a total of three years with them, initially playing for their reserve team and then becoming a first-team regular. In January 2014, Mahrez signed for English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], helping them win the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and promotion to the Premier League at the end of his first season. In the 2015–16 season he was the [[Algerian Footballer of the Year]], the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]], and was a member of the Premier League [[PFA Team of the Year]] as he helped Leicester City win the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]].

Born in France, Mahrez made his international debut for [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in 2014 and represented them at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and both the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015]] and [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations|2017]] [[Africa Cup of Nations]]. In 2016 he was named [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]'s [[African Footballer of the Year]].

==Early life==
Mahrez was born in [[Sarcelles]], France, to an Algerian father and a mother of Algerian and Moroccan descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/letemps/140838|title=Riyad Mahrez : "On a une équipe capable de faire de belles choses"|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=6 March 2016|language=French|publisher=DjaZairess}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Ahmed was from [[Beni Snous]], [[Tlemcen District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/article/detail?id=33412|title=Mahrez honoré à Tlemcen|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=28 January 2016|language=French|publisher=El Heddaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, Mahrez would regularly spend his holidays in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/article/detail?id=4572&amp;titre=comment-la-faf-a-chipe-mahrez-au-maroc|title=Comment la FAF a chipé Mahrez au Maroc|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=10 June 2014|language=French|publisher=Le Buteur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/12/leicester-city-riyad-mahrez-father-dream-algeria-world-cup|title=Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez is fast fulfilling his late father's dreams|date=12 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015|author=Paul Doyle|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood friends included fellow footballers such as [[Wissam Ben Yedder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Yedder's unquestionable self-belief driving him to reach new heights|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2518566.html|accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=UEFA|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahrez's father had played football in Algeria.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt; When Mahrez was fifteen, his father died of a heart attack. He reflected that "I don't know if I started to be more serious but after the death of my dad things started to go for me. Maybe in my head, I wanted it more".&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
Although often overlooked by teams due to his slender build, Mahrez developed ball skills that brought him attention.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

He joined AAS Sarcelles in 2004.&lt;ref name = "journey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35688719|title=Riyad Mahrez: Leicester forward's journey to top of Premier League|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016|author=Steve Crossman|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mahrez joined [[Championnat de France amateur|CFA]] side [[Quimper Kerfeunteun F.C.|Quimper]] from AAS Sarcelles, making 22 appearances and scoring 2 goals in his first season with the club.&lt;ref name="Quimper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat2foot.com/qrclubs/quimper0910.htm |language=French |title=QUIMPER 17e CFA Groupe D |publisher=Stat2foot.com |accessdate=11 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111075652/http://stat2foot.com/qrclubs/quimper0910.htm |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While playing for Quimper he lived with [[Mathias Pogba]].&lt;ref name = "journey"/&gt;

He joined [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] in 2010, turning down offers from leading French teams [[Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] to join them, being enticed by their youth system.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt; He initially played for their reserve team, Le Havre II, before going on to play 60 times and score 6 goals for the first team in the French [[Ligue 2]] from 2011 until leaving in January 2014.&lt;ref name = "SW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LFP|id=mahrez-riyad|name=Riyad Mahrez}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised Ligue 2 for what he saw as a reliance on defence and teams aiming for a goalless draw in every match.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

===Leicester City===

====2013–14 season====
While Mahrez was playing for Le Havre, English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]'s scout [[Steve Walsh (scout)|Steve Walsh]] was monitoring teammate [[Ryan Mendes]], but was instead impressed by Mahrez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City star Riyad Mahrez not target of original scouting mission says head of recruitment|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Riyad-target-scouting-mission/story-28029571-detail/story.html|accessdate=26 April 2016|work=Leicester Mercury|date=22 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129020313/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Riyad-target-scouting-mission/story-28029571-detail/story.html|archivedate=29 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahrez had never heard of Leicester, whom he initially presumed to be a rugby club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brewin|first1=Joe|title=Riyad Mahrez: The street-schooled dreamer whose ambition knew no limits|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/riyad-mahrez-street-schooled-dreamer-whose-ambition-knew-no-limits|accessdate=1 September 2016|work=FourFourTwo|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2014, he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/110114-riyad-mahrez-signs-for-leicester-city-1287938.aspx|title=Riyad Mahrez Signs For Leicester City|date=11 January 2014|accessdate=11 January 2014|publisher=Leicester City F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25639726|title=Transfer window: Riyad Mahrez joins Leicester from Le Havre|date=11 January 2014|accessdate=13 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends and family were initially sceptical of a move to English football due to its physical nature, believing that his style of play would be more suited to Spain.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

Mahrez made his debut on 25 January 2014, coming on in the 79th minute as a substitute replacing fellow winger [[Lloyd Dyer]], in the 2–0 win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25789370|title=Leicester 2&amp;nbsp;– 0 Middlesbrough|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=25 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making four substitute appearances for Leicester, including scoring his first goal for the club, an 82nd-minute equaliser against [[Leicester City F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|local rivals]] [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], manager Nigel Pearson announced in February 2014 that he thought Mahrez was ready to start games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26278839|title=Riyad Mahrez: Nigel Pearson says winger ready to start games|date=21 February 2014|accessdate=23 February 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester ended [[2013–14 Football League Championship|the season]] as winners of the Championship, returning to the Premier League for the first time in ten years.&lt;ref name=champ&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City promoted to Premier League after 10-year absence|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26906091|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Mahrez made his Premier League debut on 16 August 2014, and scored his first goal in the division on 4 October 2014 in a 2–2 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name = "SB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-news-Unknown-Riyad-Mahrez-making/story-23059629-detail/story.html|title='Unknown' Riyad Mahrez making impressive strides, says Nigel Pearson|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=Leicester Mercury|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150217/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-news-Unknown-Riyad-Mahrez-making/story-23059629-detail/story.html|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahrez was part of the Leicester team that won seven of its final nine matches of the season to avoid relegation to the Football League.

'''Ederson Santana de Moraes''' (born 17 August 1993), known simply as '''Ederson''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɛdɛɾsõ|br}}), is a Brazilian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]]. He is considered the world's most expensive goalkeeper from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/239/en/ |title=Updated transfer valuations: Mbappé takes the lead |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=5 November 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career at [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] in 2008 before joining Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] one year later, where he would spend two seasons. In 2012, he transferred from [[G.D. Ribeirão|Ribeirão]] to [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]] and became a regular starter there. He rejoined Benfica in 2015 and was assigned to the [[S.L. Benfica B|reserves]] before debuting for the first team, with whom he would win four major titles in two seasons.

For the 2017–18 season, Ederson joined English club Manchester City for £35 million and became the most expensive goalkeeper of all-time in terms of the nominal value of [[pound sterling]] at the time of his transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=8 June 2017|title=Ederson Moraes:Manchester City sign goalkeeper from Benfica for £35 million|trans-title=Most expensive goalkeeper in history in sterling|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40080163|website=BBC Sport|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the Premier League and [[EFL Cup]] in [[2017–18 Manchester City F.C. season|his first season]] in England.

Ederson made his senior debut for Brazil in 2017 after previously being [[Cap (sport)|capped]] at [[Brazil national under-23 football team|under-23]] level. He was chosen in Brazil's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career / Rio Ave===
Born in [[Osasco]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Ederson started his [[association football|football]] career in 2008 at local club [[São Paulo FC]] with whom he played one season, before joining [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in Portugal. Here, at the age of 16, he spent two years as a [[S.L. Benfica Juniors|junior]], eventually leaving for [[Portuguese Second Division|Second Division]] side [[G.D. Ribeirão|Ribeirão]] in 2011. A year later, he joined [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]]. In summer 2012, he officially signed a contract with Rio Ave. In May 2015, following a string of good performances and a call to the [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil under-23 squad]], he signed a new contract with the club that would last until 2019.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Benfica===
[[File:Zenit-Benf (7).jpg|alt=|thumb|318x318px|left|Ederson playing for [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] against [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] in 2016]]
On 27 June 2015, Ederson joined Portuguese champions Benfica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/benfica/interior/conheca-os-novos-reforcos-do-benfica-4648648.html|title=Conheça os 10 novos reforços do Benfica|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Meet the 10 new Benfica players|last=Ruela|first=João|date=27 June 2015|publisher=[[Diário de Notícias]]|access-date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in July, he officially signed a five-year contract with the club, in a deal worth €500,000, and set a €45 million release clause. Rio Ave would keep 50% of the upcoming keeper's economic rights. In the [[2015–16 S.L. Benfica season|2015–16 season]], Ederson started as a second choice in line for the first team, defended by compatriot and international [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]]. Ederson first played some matches in the [[Segunda Liga]] with the [[S.L. Benfica B|reserve team]] and in the [[Taça da Liga]] with the main squad, before playing in the Primeira Liga on 5 March 2016 against [[Derby de Lisboa|local rivals]] [[Sporting CP]], replacing injured Júlio César. Benfica won the Lisbon derby 0–1 and took the first place of Primeira Liga. He would then be part of eleven more victories that would seal Benfica's 35th league title, their third in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefinalball.com/player_results.php?id=136885&amp;epoca_id=145&amp;ps=0|title=Ederson Moraes|website=thefinalball.com|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, he played the [[2016 Taça da Liga Final|Taça da Liga final]] against [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]], which Benfica won 6–2. In addition, he played three matches in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|Champions League campaign]], where Benfica reached the quarter-finals. In his [[2016–17 S.L. Benfica season|next season]], he and Benfica won the treble of [[2016–17 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]], [[2016–17 Taça de Portugal|Taça de Portugal]] and [[2016 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira]].

===Manchester City===
[[File:Ederson Moraes (36243872090) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Ederson with Manchester City in 2017]]
On 1 June 2017, Benfica announced that Ederson had joined [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £35 million (€40 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 June 2017|title=Ederson transferido para o Manchester City|trans-title=Ederson transferred to Manchester City|url=http://www.slbenfica.pt/30/news/info/t8JYPAn5zkKsW8hlgu_4Dg|language=Portuguese|website=S.L.

He graduated with a degree in physics from [[Chernivtsi University]], where from 1983-1985 he headed the Komsomol youth organization.

In September 2005 he resigned from the latter position in protest against [[Political corruption|corruption]] he alleged was taking place in the inner circle of the President, mainly accusing [[Petro Poroshenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/editorial/23161 Zinchenko's bombshell], [[Kyiv Post]] (7 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005 he created the political party ''Oleksander Zinchenko’s Patriotic Forces Party of Ukraine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/23653 Oleksandr Zinchenko talks], [[Kyiv Post]] (21 December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guardiola said of Foden: "It’s dangerous to say good things about young players because they are still young, and they have to grow and they have to learn many, many things … But we have a lot of confidence to help him, because we believe he is a guy who has potential, even if he’s not strong, he’s not tall … I think he has absolutely good potential to be helped, and that is what we do."&lt;ref name="GoalSL"/&gt;
