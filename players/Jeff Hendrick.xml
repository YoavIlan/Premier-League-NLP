'''Jeffrey Patrick Hendrick''' (born 31 January 1992) is an Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Hendrick spent his early years with boyhood club St. Kevin's Boys in his native [[Dublin]]. He had a number of unsuccessful trials in England before joining [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s youth academy in 2008. Hendrick made his professional debut in April 2011 after impressive performances with the reserve team led manager [[Nigel Clough]] to include him in the senior setup. He quickly became a regular starter and appeared in the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final|2014 Championship play-off final]] where Derby missed out on promotion with a 1–0 loss to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Hendrick amassed a total of 214 appearances for Derby over seven seasons. He joined newly promoted Premier League side Burnley in August 2016, signing a three-year deal.

Hendrick has represented Ireland at all youth levels. Since his senior international debut in 2013, he has made over 40 appearances for Ireland and represented them at [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Derby County===
====Early years====
Hendrick joined Derby County as a youth player in 2008 from St Kevin's Boys in Dublin, having overcome [[Osgood-Schlatter disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/european-championships/hendrick-my-gaa-career-never-took-off-i-was-always-a-soccer-boy-31293997.html|title=Hendrick: My GAA career never took off, I was always a soccer boy|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|first=David|last=Kelly|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played regularly for the club's academy side before breaking into the reserve team during the 2009–10 campaign. He made [[2009–10 Derby County F.C. season#Player statistics|one start and seven substitute appearances]] as the club's reserve side successfully captured the [[The Central League#2008.E2.80.93present|2009–10 Central League Central Section title]]. At the end of the season his first involvement with the Derby County first team came on 2 May 2010 as he was an unused substitute in a 2–0 victory over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the final match of the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8644971.stm|title=Derby 2–0 Cardiff|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, on 8 July 2010, he signed his first professional contract, alongside four other Derby County academy graduates, including fellow Republic of Ireland Youth international [[Ryan Connolly]] and future [[League of Ireland]] player [[Graham Kelly (footballer, born 1991)|Graham Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2087069,00.html|title=Academy Five sign professional deals |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710134346/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2087069%2C00.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick played a more significant role in Derby's reserve side during the 2010–11 season, making [[2010–11 Derby County F.C. season#Player statistics|17 starts in all competitions and scoring 9 goals]], including a [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] in a 14–1 victory over [[Shirebrook Town F.C.|Shirebrook Town]] in the [[Derbyshire Senior Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/rams-rack-goals-cruise-victory-senior-cup-encounter/story-11604375-detail/story.html|title=Rams rack up the goals as they cruise to victory in Senior Cup encounter|newspaper=[[Derby Telegraph]]|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612171921/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-rack-goals-cruise-victory-Senior-Cup-encounter/story-11604375-detail/story.html|archivedate=12 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in a 5–0 win over [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]] in the final of the same competition.&lt;ref name="seniorcup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2343232,00.html|title=Rams lift the Senior Cup |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423011817/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2343232%2C00.html |archivedate=23 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the campaign, Hendrick impressed enough to earn a contract extension at Derby, which he signed in January 2011 to take him through until Summer 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/hendrick-and-connolly-agree-new-derby-deals|title=Hendrick and Connolly agree new Derby deals|publisher=[[Football Association of Ireland]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–2013====
Approaching the end of the 2010–11 campaign, Derby manager [[Nigel Clough]] stated his desire to give Hendrick a run in the first team, stating "(He's) progressed and done well this season...we would love to see him in the team for three or four games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/clough-keen-duo-chance-rams/story-11605160-detail/story.html|title=Nigel Clough is keen to give young duo a chance for Rams before season ends|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108193648/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Clough-keen-duo-chance-Rams/story-11605160-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick made his debut in the following match on 23 April 2011, as an 80th-minute replacement for [[Robbie Savage]] in a 4–2 home defeat to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~52424,00.html |title=Derby County 2 – 4 Burnley |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=23 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425233456/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10270~52424%2C00.html |archivedate=25 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2011–12 Derby County F.C. season|2011–12 season]], manager Nigel Clough stated that Hendrick would feature in the Derby County first team squad more often.&lt;ref name="11/12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/hendrick-future-knocks-door-rams/story-12905468-detail/story.html|title=Hendrick one for future as he knocks on door at Rams|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108190426/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Hendrick-future-knocks-door-Rams/story-12905468-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allocated the squad number of 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2396288,00.html |title=Squad Numbers Confirmed |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111707/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2396288%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite missing the majority of Derby's pre-season due to his call-up to the [[2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|European under-19 tournament]],&lt;ref name="11/12" /&gt; Hendrick was involved in first team duty from the start of the campaign, making substitute appearances in the season's opening two matches, against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He then claimed a place in the starting line-up from the third match (a 1–0 win at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]) onward. He scored his first professional goal in his fifth start of the season, claiming the winner in a 2–1 victory at [[Derby County F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|local rivals]] [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/14864055.stm|title=Nott'm Forest 1–2 Derby County|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 September 2011|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2456295,00.html |title=Hero Jeff named in Team of the Week |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924182056/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10270~2456295%2C00.html |archivedate=24 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his rich vein of form followed into the next match, a 3–0 thumping of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], in which Hendrick grabbed his first goal at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] and secured a second consecutive Team of the Week place.&lt;ref name="millwallhometotw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2465381,00.html|title=Trio rewarded with Team of the Week spots|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=28 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820185118/http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2465381,00.html#|archive-date=20 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick's form saw him linked with switches to Premier League duo [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref name="premierlinks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/aston-villa-west-bromwich-albion-3314957|title=Derby midfielder a target for Prem clubs|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=8 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speculation saw Derby enter into contract talks with the midfielder over a new four-year deal.&lt;ref name="premierlinks" /&gt; However, his form tailed off badly (as did Derby's) over the subsequent six weeks, culminating in his substitution in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 19 November 2011, the first time in his young career he had been removed from a match early after being in the starting eleven, with Clough suggesting that the contract talks and Hendrick getting "[[Sports agent#Role|people]]" had had a negative effect on his game.&lt;ref name="peoplenow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/boss-blames-contract-talks-hendrick-dip-form/story-13909785-detail/story.html|title=Boss blames contract talks for Hendrick dip in form|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=29 July 2016}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the Dublin native signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract, extending his stay at the Pride Park club until the summer of 2015.&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2538477,00.html|title=Hendrick Pens New Rams Deal|publisher=Derby County F.C.|date=10 December 2011|accessdate=12 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820175821/http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2538477,00.html#|archive-date=20 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick missed Derby's Christmas and New Year programme of fixtures with an ankle ligament injury in a 1–0 defeat against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref name="2011injury"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16284131|title=Derby's Jeff Hendrick ruled out until January|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrick returned to the first team squad as an unused substitute in a 1–0 win against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 14 January 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16453637|title=Derby 2–0 Coventry|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; returning to playing action a week later in the 0–0 draw at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] as a 47th-minute substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16559443|title=Burnley 0–0 Derby|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2012|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started every match for the remainder of the season after this fixture, displacing [[James Bailey (footballer)|James Bailey]] in central midfield.

His run and nutmeg set up an easy finish for [[Jonathan Walters]] which proved to be the only goal of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34063056|title=Republic of Ireland 1–0 Georgia|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrick scored his first goal for Ireland on 5 September 2016. He opened the scoring in the third minute in the 2–2 away draw against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup qualifying]] match with a low shot just outside the penalty area which was deflected in off [[Branislav Ivanović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2016/0905/814414-daryl-murphy-snatches-point-for-ireland-in-serbia/|title=Daryl Murphy snatches point for the Republic of Ireland in Serbia|publisher=RTÉ Sport|first=Ed|last=Leahy|date=5 September 2016|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==

Hendrick is known for being very hard-working, tactically aware and for his ability to pass the ball successfully.&lt;ref name="F365"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football365.com/news/forensically-watching-ordinary-player-jeff-hendrick|title=Forensically watching an ordinary player: Jeff Hendrick|publisher=Football365|first=Peter|last=Goldstein|date=30 March 2018|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is capable of playing as a central midfielder or an attacking midfielder behind the striker.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt; His big strength is winning second balls from aerial duels and keeping the attack going in advanced positions.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt; Owing to his lack of proficiency in scoring goals, Hendrick's most frequent task is recycling possession high up the pitch to create chances for his teammates.&lt;ref name="F365"/&gt;
