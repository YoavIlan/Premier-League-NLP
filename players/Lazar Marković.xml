'''Lazar Marković''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Лазар Марковић}}, {{IPA-sh|lâzaːr mǎːrkoʋitɕ|pron}}; born 2 March 1994) is a Serbian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]].

He started his career at [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] before moving to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in 2013, where he won a domestic [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in his only season, after which he completed a £20 million move to Liverpool. His second season at Liverpool was spent on loan at [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]], and finished prematurely due to injury. He was then transferred to [[Sporting CP]] on a season-long loan, which was cancelled in January 2017, after which he was loaned to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. In January 2019 he moved to [[Fulham F.C|Fulham]] on a free transfer after not making a competitive appearance for Liverpool since May 2015.

Marković made his full international debut for Serbia in 2012.

==Club career==
===Partizan===
After playing for the youth selections of [[FK Borac Čačak|Borac Čačak]], Marković joined [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in 2006 as a 12-year-old trainee.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.294.html:352273-Braca-Markovic-Sanjamo-Ligu-sampiona | title=Braća Marković: Sanjamo Ligu šampiona! | language=Serbian | publisher=novosti.rs | date=7 November 2011 | accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2011, coach [[Aleksandar Stanojević]] promoted Marković to the first team ahead of the final round of the [[2010–11 Serbian SuperLiga|2010–11 SuperLiga]], which Partizan played against [[FK Sloboda Užice|Sloboda Užice]]. He was given the number 50 shirt. Marković was used as a second-half substitute for [[Joseph Kizito]] in his team's 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.72.html:332319-JSL-Partizan-pobedio-i-na-rastanku | title=JSL: Partizan pobedio i na rastanku | language=Serbian | publisher=novosti.rs | date=29 May 2011 | accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
On 11 July 2011, together with [[Nikola Ninković]], Marković signed his first professional contract with Partizan, for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.partizan.rs/14289-markovi%C4%87-i-ninkovi%C4%87-profesionalci/ | title=Marković i Ninković profesionalci! | language=Serbian | publisher=partizan.rs | date=11 July 2011 | accessdate=11 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sport.blic.rs/Fudbal/Domaci-fudbal/200111/Partizan-osvezio-vezni-red-svojim-talentima-Ninkovicem-i-Markovicem | title=Partizan osvežio vezni red svojim talentima, Ninkovićem i Markovićem | language=Serbian | publisher=blic.rs | date=11 July 2011 | accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marković made his first appearance of the 2011–12 season in Partizan's opener against [[KF Shkëndija|Shkëndija]], in the qualifying round of the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], playing the last three minutes of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/matches/round=2000260/match=2007494/index.html | title=Four-goal Partizan too hot for Skendija | publisher=uefa.com | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first senior goal in a league match against [[FK Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]], on 13 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mozzartsport.com/vesti/5181/presre%C4%87ni-markovi%C4%87/ | title=Presrećni Marković | language=Serbian | publisher=mozzartsport.com | date=15 August 2011 | accessdate=22 August 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325045514/http://www.mozzartsport.com/vesti/5181/presre%C4%87ni-markovi%C4%87/ | archivedate=25 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2011, Marković was voted Partizan's Player of the Year in a poll on the club's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=568504 | title=Marković najbolji igrač Partizana | language=Serbian | publisher=b92.net | date=24 December 2011 | accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full senior season, Marković made 26 league appearances and scored six goals. Despite not scoring a goal in the second half of the championship, Marković earned [[2011–12 Serbian SuperLiga|2011–12 SuperLiga]] Team of the Year selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sport.blic.rs/Fudbal/Domaci-fudbal/214566/Lazovic-Markovic-i-Simic-predvode-idealan-tim-Superlige | title=Lazović, Marković i Šimić predvode idealan tim Superlige | language=Serbian | publisher=blic.rs | date=14 May 2012 | accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
As Partizan appeared in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage|group stage of an UEFA competition]] for the first time since 2010, Marković appeared in all group fixtures, impressing against the likes of [[Neftçi PFK|Neftchi Baku]], [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]].

===Benfica===
On the morning hours of 10 June 2013, Partizan club president [[Dragan Đurić]] told ''[[Sportski žurnal]]'', "[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] wants to loan Marković to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] for two years, and honestly speaking, I hope to God that they don't come to an agreement so that Lazar can stay six more months at Partizan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=sr:КРАЈ САГЕ: Челзи позајмио Марковића у Бенфику на две године|url=http://www.zurnal.rs/2013/06/10/kraj-sage-celzi-pozajmio-markovica-u-benfiku-na-dve-godine/index.html|work=zurnal.rs|language=Serbian|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was later misinterpreted by several non-Serbian sports news outlets, which incorrectly cited Đurić stating, "It is true, Chelsea will send Marković on a loan for two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partizan Belgrade Claim Chelsea Have Already Signed Serbian Youngster Lazar Markovic|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2013/06/10/partizan-belgrade-claim-chelsea-have-already-signed-croatian-youngster-lazar-markovic/|work=caughtoffside.com|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partizan: Chelsea own Markovic|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/premierleague/story/Partizan-Chelsea-own-Markovic-28825949|work=FOX Sports|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately eight hours after the article was published, Benfica's official website released a statement stating Marković had signed a five-year contract with the club, not mentioning any loan deal with Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazar Markovic contratado pelo SL Benfica por cinco temporadas|trans-title=Lazar Markovic signed by Benfica for five seasons|url=http://aovivo.slbenfica.pt/Noticias/DetalhedeNoticia/tabid/790/ArticleId/30008/language/pt-PT/Lazar-Markovic-contratado-pelo-SL-Benfica-por-cinco-temporadas.aspx|work=S.L. Benfica|language=Portuguese|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier statements regarding a potential loan deal with Chelsea caused great confusion among journalists and followers of the transfer saga alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benfica contradict Partizan, claim they're signed Markovic to 5-year deal|url=http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/6/10/4415428/lazar-markovic-transfer-rumour-benfica|work=weaintgotnohistory.com|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2013, Marković made his debut for Benfica in 2–1 win against [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]], scoring a decisive goal at the 92nd minute that drew the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benfica 2–1 Gil Vicente|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/gamecast/statistics/id/372753/statistics.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739|work=espnfc.com|date=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third matchday of the [[2013–14 Primeira Liga]] season, against [[Sporting CP]] at the [[Estádio José Alvalade]], Marković scored the equalizing goal after a dribble past three players, as the match ended in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SuperLiga – New signings shine as Lisbon derby ends in draw |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/superliga-sporting-lisbon-v-benfica-live-185345122.html |work=uk.eurosport.yahoo.com |date=31 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904090640/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/superliga-sporting-lisbon-v-benfica-live-185345122.html |archivedate= 4 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2014, in injury time of Benfica's [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]] [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Semi-finals|semi-final second leg match]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], Marković was sent off for a fight with his opponent [[Mirko Vučinić]]. Neither were on the field of play at the time, Marković having been substituted and Vučinić still on the substitutes' bench. Marković therefore missed [[2014 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]] through suspension; Benfica lost the final to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] on penalties (4–2) after a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Juventus 0–0 Benfica|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27226534|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
