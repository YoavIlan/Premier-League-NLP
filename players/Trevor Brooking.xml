'''Sir Trevor David Brooking''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE}} (born 2 October 1948) is a former [[England national football team|England]] international [[Association football|footballer]], manager, [[pundit]] and football administrator; he now works as director of football development in England.

He played most of his career for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] making 647 appearances for the club. He won the [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975 FA Cup]] and the [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980 FA Cup]] in which he scored the only goal. He was also the club's [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|player of the season]] on four occasions and caretaker manager on two occasions in 2003. Brooking played 47 times for [[England national football team|England]], scoring five times. He was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1981, elevated to [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|Commander]] of same order (CBE) in 1999, and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 2004. In 2009 a stand at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] was named after Brooking. Since retiring from playing, he has taken up a number of positions in broadcasting as an on-air analyst and in football and sports administration.

==Club career==

===West Ham United===
Brooking was born in [[Barking, London|Barking]] maternity hospital to mother Margaret and father, Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking attended Ripple Infants School and left [[Ilford County High School]] with 11 [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]]s and 2 [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]].&lt;ref name="brooking"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooking |first=Trevor |title=Trevor Brooking |publisher=Pelham Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-7207-1374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father took him to see his first [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] game at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], a 1–1 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 19 Apr 1958 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2094&amp;united=19_Apr_1958 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged fifteen he trained at both [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name="page 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However West Ham manager, [[Ron Greenwood]] watched him with scout [[Wally St Pier]], and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies.&lt;ref name="page 17"/&gt; Despite his parents being offered £500 and a car by manager [[Tommy Docherty]] to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;

Brooking made his debut in place of wide-right [[Brian Dear]] on 29 August 1967 in a 3–3 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4–2 away win at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=85&amp;united=Trevor_Brooking |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only [[hat-trick]] came on 6 April 1968 in a 5–0 home defeat of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; During his third season, in December 1969 Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref name="page 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club signed [[Peter Eustace]] for £90,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected and he considered giving up the game.&lt;ref name="page 39"/&gt; However he returned to playing and with the departure of [[Martin Peters]] to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971–72 season with the purchase of midfielder [[Tommy Taylor (footballer born 1951)|Tommy Taylor]], and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the failure of the defensive partnership between [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Alan Stephenson]] saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1972–73 season he came to the attention of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] manager [[Brian Clough]], who offered West Ham £400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] offered £425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him.&lt;ref name=brooking/&gt;

He won the [[FA Cup]] twice, in [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]]&lt;ref name=1975fa&gt;{{cite web |title=1975 West Ham v Fulham |url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120428152821/http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham |dead-url=yes |archivedate=28 April 2012 |publisher=www.thefa.com |accessdate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  with Brooking scoring a vital goal in a 2–1 win in a 4th round replay away at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]&lt;ref name=stfc&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 28 Jan 1975 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2911&amp;united=28_Jan_1975 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]; in the latter, he scored another vital goal in a 2–1 win in a third round replay against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]&lt;ref name=wbfc&gt;{{cite web |title=Game played on 08 Jan 1980 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3158&amp;united=08_Jan_1980 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup Final hero: Sir Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203349/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking was a member of the West Ham team which won the [[1980–81 West Ham United F.C. season|Second Division in 1981]]. He also appeared in the [[1975 FA Charity Shield]], the [[1976 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]], the [[1980 FA Charity Shield]] and the [[1981 Football League Cup Final]]. His last game for West Ham came on 18 May 1984 in 1–0 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; In total he made 647 appearances and scoring 102 times, wearing the number 10 jersey, his total appearances for West Ham only beaten by [[Billy Bonds]], [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Frank Lampard, Sr.|Frank Lampard]] Sr. He had a [[testimonial match]] against an England XI in October 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Brooking accepted an invitation to play for [[Newcastle Blue Star F.C.|Blue Star]] in a Wearside League game against [[Coundon TT F.C.|Coundon]] on 28 April 1985.  Blue Star had paid for him to fly to Newcastle as their guest and reportedly paid him an appearance fee of £500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://northernleagueday.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-the-northern-league-matters-to-me-1/ |title=Why the Northern League matters to me |publisher=NorthernLeagueToday |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Brooking played briefly for [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] making two appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cork City&amp;nbsp;— History |url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/club-info/history/ |publisher=www.corkcityfc.net |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lyallpavilion&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir Trevor Brooking Opens John Lyall Pavilion |url=http://fcbusiness.co.uk/news/article/newsitem=1481/title=sir+trevor+brooking+opens+john+lyall+pavilion |publisher=www.fcbusiness.co.uk |accessdate=24 September 2012 |date=20 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231051/http://fcbusiness.co.uk/news/article/newsitem=1481/title=sir+trevor+brooking+opens+john+lyall+pavilion |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Brooking made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 3 April 1974 in a 0–0 draw against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref name=England&gt;{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking&amp;nbsp;— England |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222125910/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |dead-url=yes |archivedate=22 February 2013 |publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played 47 times, scoring 5 goals but only appeared twice in major tournaments. At [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] in Italy he played in England's opening game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] which was a 1–1 draw, but was dropped for the second game against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] which England lost 1–0. Re-instated to the starting eleven against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] he scored England's first goal in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England match details 1980-1984 |url=http://www.englandfc.com/nostal/yrbyyr/1980_1984.html |publisher=www.englandfc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927231019/http://www.englandfc.com/nostal/yrbyyr/1980_1984.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to injury [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 1982]] was to see him limited to playing as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] against Spain on 5 July 1982. Playing for only the last half-hour of the game, Brooking forced one excellent save from the Spanish goalkeeper, [[Luis Arconada]], but with England needing to win to qualify for the semi-final a 0-0 draw saw them eliminated. This was to be his final international appearance.&lt;ref name=Lastintgame&gt;{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/B/Trevor-Brooking |publisher=Www.thefa.com |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Brooking was primarily right-footed, but was comfortable on his left foot. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his controlled passing and midfield authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diamonds Aren't Forever |url=http://www.thesportcollective.com/diamonds-arent-forever-joe-cole-england-liverpool-chelsea-west-ham/2011/06/ |publisher=www.thesportcollective.com |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after [[Cyril Lord]] the carpet salesman, as [[Ron Greenwood]] told him "you're always on the floor").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow [[baseball]] player called [[Boog Powell]] the team had witnessed during a tour of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, [[Hadleigh (TV series)|Hadleigh]], after a television [[upper class]] and urbane detective played by [[Gerald Harper]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadleigh&gt;{{cite news |last=Coe |first=Sebastian |title=Government programme for sport delivered by Lottery |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3035967/Government-programme-for-sport-delivered-by-Lottery.html# |accessdate=17 September 2012 |newspaper=www.dailytelegraph.co.uk |date=12 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
In April 2003, after West Ham manager [[Glenn Roeder]] collapsed due to a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], Brooking, having long been on the board at West Ham, briefly took over as caretaker manager. The club were fighting relegation from the [[Premier League]]. Brooking took charge of three games. His first game resulted in a 1–0 away win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] with a goal from [[Frédéric Kanouté]].&lt;ref name=mcfc2003&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Kanoute injects fresh hope into West Ham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/28/match.manchestercity |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=www.guardian.co.uk |date=28 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second saw West Ham beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1–0, thanks to a goal from [[Paolo Di Canio]].&lt;ref name=whufccfc2003&gt;{{cite news |title=Di Canio grabs West Ham lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2968013.stm |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final game of the season saw West Ham draw 2–2 away at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] resulting in relegation,&lt;ref name=bcfcwhu2003&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham relegated |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2978071.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  albeit with 42 points, a record number for a relegated team.&lt;ref name=fortytwo&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title='Survival Sunday' looms in what promises to be one of the tightest Premier League relegation battles ever |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8362912/Survival-Sunday-looms-in-what-promises-to-be-one-of-the-tightest-Premier-League-relegation-battles-ever.html |accessdate=12 August 2011 |newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk |date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first three games of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003/2004 season]] with West Ham now in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], Roeder was sacked after West Ham suffered an away defeat to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]&lt;ref name=Roedersacked&gt;{{cite news |title=Roeder sacking inevitable |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3178205.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brooking was again installed as caretaker manager. He managed for eleven games, losing only once, to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], a 2–0 away defeat in which [[Jermain Defoe]] was sent-off.&lt;ref name=gills&gt;{{cite news |title=Gillingham 2-0 West Ham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3109594.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003 he was replaced by [[Alan Pardew]], who was appointed on his recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media career==
In 1984, Brooking joined the [[BBC]] as a pundit, and has featured on radio and television commentary since, including the BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]'' and coverage of [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]]. He was also the co-commentator in the ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]'' video game series, alongside [[Peter Brackley]] until ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 6]]''.

==Football administration==
Brooking was Chair of the Eastern Region Council for Sport and Recreation from 1987 until 1997, and between 1999 and 2002 he was chairman of [[Sport England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, he joined [[the Football Association]] as Director of Football Development, a role which gave him total of control of coaching and development in English football, as well as a role in appointing future [[England national football team|England]] managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooking|2014|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a key part of the selection process for the successor of the [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], revealed in May 2006 to be [[Steve McClaren]]. In 2004, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to sport.&lt;ref name="LG"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=57315 |supp=y|page=1|date=12 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In 2009 West Ham United announced that from 8 August, the start of the 2009/10 Premier League Season, 'The Centenary Stand' at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] would be named 'The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand' in his honour.&lt;ref name=stand&gt;{{cite web|title=Srand for Sir Trevor |url=http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724154238/http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stand was used by away supporters and had been the scene for crowd disturbances. In 2009 in a [[2009 Upton Park riot|match between West Ham and Millwall]] seats were torn out by Millwall fans and hurled towards West Ham fans.&lt;ref name=seats&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham and Millwall charged over crowd trouble |url=http://www.wharf.co.uk/2009/09/west-ham-and-millwall-charged.html |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=www.wharf.co.uk |date=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227092224/http://www.wharf.co.uk/2009/09/west-ham-and-millwall-charged.html |archivedate=27 December 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent seasons, Millwall fans were segregated to the upper tier of the stand and kept at least 30 yards from West Ham fans to prevent crowd disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walters |first=Mike |title=West Ham vs Millwall goes into lockdown |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/West-Ham-v-Millwall-match-sees-massive-security-operation-to-prevent-repeat-of-2009-riot-article861002.html |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=www.dailymirror.co.uk |date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stand at the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] is also named after Brooking and used by West Ham after their move from the Boleyn Ground from the start of the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref name="Olympic stand"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/9962213/West-Ham-United-reveal-further-plans-for-Olympic-Stadium-redevelopment.html |title=West Ham United reveal further plans for Olympic Stadium redevelopment |work=The Telegraph |date=29 March 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=It is obviously a terrific honour (to have the stand named after me), which I am very grateful for because this is my club. It will be my club forever. The great thing was being able to spend my whole career with West Ham, having a stint as caretaker manager and as a director.
I still try and get to most of the home games. On my travels, if I am in a cab or something then everyone talks to me about West Ham because they know I am associated with the club. It is something I am only too pleased about whenever it happens. We have a very passionate and loyal support
