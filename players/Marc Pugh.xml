'''Marc Anthony Pugh''' (born 2 April 1987) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] of the {{English football updater|HullCity}}, on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. He plays mainly as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] but can also play as a [[midfielder]].

Pugh started his career with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], where he progressed through the youth system. He was released by the club having made his first team while on loan at [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] and signed a short-term contract with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in 2006. Pugh later signed a professional contract at the club and after rejecting an extended contract in 2007 he signed for [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. He was loaned out to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], joining the latter permanently in 2009.

Pugh left Hereford after one season to sign for Bournemouth in 2010, where he was top scorer in his first two seasons. He has since made over 300 appearances for the club, helping them win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Championship in 2013 and the Premier League two years later. As a result, Pugh has played and scored in all five of England's nationwide football divisions.

==Early and personal life==
Pugh was born in [[Bacup]], Lancashire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Barry J. |editor-last=Hugman |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2010–11 |year=2010 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-84596-601-0 |page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Tony and Denise.&lt;ref name="AFC Bournemouth star Marc Pugh: Hat-trick was for my family"/&gt; He grew up in [[Stacksteads]] and attended [[All Saints' Catholic High School, Rawtenstall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making a Marc – footballer Marc Pugh's Free Press diary |url=https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/making-marc---footballer-marc-1706547 |newspaper=Rossendale Free Express |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Laura, with whom he has two daughters.&lt;ref name="AFC Bournemouth star Marc Pugh: Hat-trick was for my family"/&gt; Pugh is a devout Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=Howard |title=Marc Pugh: I've got a great life and I owe it all to God |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14242715.Marc_Pugh__I___ve_got_a_great_life_and_I_owe_it_all_to_God/ |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Burnley===
Pugh started his career with [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003.&lt;ref name="Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster |website=TheFootballNetwork.net |publisher=DA Group |url=http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st85191.htm |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], they decided to keep him on for a third year.&lt;ref name="Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster"/&gt; As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Scholes |title=Pugh gets deal |url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/pugh_gets_deal_282980/index.shtml |website=Clarets Mad |publisher=Digital Sports Group |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to him to being [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] out to [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] of the [[Conference National]] in November 2005 to play first team football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidderminster agree deal for Pugh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kidderminster_harriers/4424424.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 3–1 defeat to [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]].&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; He converted a [[Simon Heslop]] [[Cross (football)|cross]] during a match against [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]] to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidderminster 3–1 Dag &amp; Red |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/4472998.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 December 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on ''[[Soccer AM]]'''s [[Showboat#Showboating|showboating]] section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marc Pugh |url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/QandA/0,,10443~1146115,00.html |publisher=Shrewsbury Town F.C. |date=18 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705214147/http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/QandA/0%2C%2C10443~1146115%2C00.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after picking up a groin injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pugh returns from Harriers spell |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/4523850.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pugh resumes harriers spell |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~765006,00.html |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=7 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151929/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0%2C%2C10413~765006%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pugh returns from Harriers spell |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/4650330.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 January 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; He learned that he would not receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006, which was partly because both [[Chris McCann]] and [[Kyle Lafferty]] had both already received professional contracts and they were only second year apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youth team news |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~795034,00.html |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=27 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151944/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0%2C%2C10413~795034%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bury===
Having just been released from Burnley, Pugh signed for [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on a short-term contract on 23 March 2006, following a three-week [[Trial (association football)|trial]].&lt;ref name="Shakers capture midfield quartet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakers capture midfield quartet |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bury/4836832.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakers sign Pugh |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/715043.Shakers_sign_Pugh/ |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |location=Blackburn |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bury were entangled in a [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] battle, and Pugh made his debut two days later after coming on as an 80th-minute substitute in a 2–1 home win over [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bury 2–1 Rochdale |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4819762.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marked his first start for Bury with a goal from 10&amp;nbsp;yards in a 1–1 away draw with [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on 15 April 2006,&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lincoln City 1–1 Bury |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4890980.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Chris Casper]] commented "Mark's a good player and he's got a bright future if he keeps his feet on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Casper pays tribute to Pugh |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casper-pays-tribute-to-pugh-1027072 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 2005–06 season by playing six matches and scoring one goal for the club.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; As a result of his good performances, and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation in 19th place, Bury manager Chris Casper offered him a new one-year contract at [[Gigg Lane]]; his first professional contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three extend at Gigg |url=http://www.buryfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10422~832460,00.html |publisher=Bury F.C. |date=23 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004034112/http://www.buryfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10422~832460%2C00.html |archivedate=4 October 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=League Two: 2005/06: Latest table |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=242 |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
