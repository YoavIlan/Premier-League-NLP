'''Wulfert Cornelius''' "'''Marco'''" '''van Ginkel''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmɑrkoː vɑŋ ˈɣɪŋkəl|-|Marco van Ginkel pronunciation.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;''Van'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; born 1 December 1992) is a Dutch [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/chelsea-article/article/3229666/title/marco-van-ginkel |title=MARCO VAN GINKEL |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708081652/http://www.chelseafc.com/chelsea-article/article/3229666/title/marco-van-ginkel |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel began his career in the youth ranks of [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]], joining the [[Arnhem]]-based club as a six-year-old in 1999. After making his way through the various youth levels at the club, Van Ginkel debuted for the senior team in 2010 before sealing a transfer around £9&amp;nbsp;million to Chelsea in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=1968948.html |title=Van Ginkel confirmed as Chelsea's latest recruit |publisher=UEFA |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a serious knee injury early into his Chelsea career which ruled him out for seven months. He then went on season-long loans to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in [[2014–15 A.C. Milan season|2014–15]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and PSV in [[2015–16 Stoke City F.C. season|2015–16]].

At international level, Van Ginkel represented the Netherlands at the [[Netherlands national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels before making his [[Netherlands national football team|senior team]] debut against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1473545/agent-chelsea-interested-van-ginkel?cc=5901 |title=Agent: Chelsea interested in Van Ginkel |publisher=ESPNFC |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Vitesse===
[[File:Marco van Ginkel.png|thumb|left|Van Ginkel playing for [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]].]]
Van Ginkel made his debut for [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]] on 9 April 2010, replacing [[Nicky Hofs]] in the 67th minute as the club fell to a 4–1 defeat to [[RKC Waalwijk]] in [[2009–10 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/04/09/netherlands/eredivisie/rkc-waalwijk/sbv-vitesse/781847/ |title=RKC Waalwijk vs. Vitesse  4 – 1 |publisher=US Soccerway |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was just seventeen at the time of his senior club debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/5/27/4369534/potential-chelsea-fc-transfer-target-marco-van-ginkel-vitesse-arnhem |title=Getting to know Chelsea target Marco van Ginkel |publisher=SB Nation |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first senior goal for the club came in his first appearance of the [[2010–11 Eredivisie]] campaign, netting in the 43rd minute to bring the game to 2–2 before two second-half goals sent [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] to a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/08/14/netherlands/eredivisie/afc-ajax/sbv-vitesse/941419/ |title=Ajax vs. Vitesse 4–2 |publisher=US Soccerway |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ginkel scored Vitesse's second and fifth goals in a 5–2 defeat of [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Roda JC]] on 29 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2011/01/29/netherlands/eredivisie/sbv-vitesse/roda-jc/941590/ |title=Vitesse vs. Roda JC 5–2 |publisher=US Soccerway |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012–13 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] on 19 December 2012, Van Ginkel scored Vitesse's second goal in a memorable 10–1 win over [[Topklasse|third division]] side [[ADO '20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/12/19/netherlands/knvb-beker/sbv-vitesse/aanhouden-doet-overwinnen-1920/1408127/ |title=Vitesse vs. ADO '20 10–1 |publisher=US Soccerway |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2013, Van Ginkel notched a brace and [[Wilfried Bony]] netted a hat-trick as Vitesse defeated [[Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] in a 5–3 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/02/23/netherlands/eredivisie/stichting-heracles-almelo/sbv-vitesse/1290631/ |title= Heracles vs. Vitesse 3–5 |publisher=US Soccerway |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stellar [[2012–13 Eredivisie|campaign]] that saw Van Ginkel net eight Eredivisie goals and Vitesse finish in fourth, the club's highest position since finishing in third in [[1997–98 Eredivisie|1998]], he was voted as the [[Dutch Football Talent of the Year#Dutch Football Talent of the Year|Dutch Talent of the Year]] awarding his play as the best footballer in the league under 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892/transfer-zone/2013/05/27/4006681/chelsea-set-to-secure-van-ginkel-as-mourinhos-first-signing |title=Chelsea set to secure Van Ginkel as Mourinho's first signing |publisher=Goal.com |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johan Cruyff Trophy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitesse.nl/vitessenl/nieuws/detail/3488 |title=Marco van Ginkel wint Johan Cruijff Prijs |publisher=Vitesse |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=27 May 2013 |language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his prospected moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], he was regarded as being the next [[Frank Lampard]] by Vitesse manager [[Peter Bosz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/vitesse-praise-van-ginkel-hunters-chelsea-and-new-coach-suggests- |title=Vitesse praise Van Ginkel hunters Chelsea, new coach suggests player could be leaving soon |publisher=Sports Witness |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
On 3 July 2013, English [[Premier League]] club Chelsea announced that they had reached an agreement with Vitesse for the transfer of Van Ginkel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3227800/title/agreement-reached-for-transfer-of-van-ginkel |title=AGREEMENT REACHED FOR TRANSFER OF VAN GINKEL |publisher=Chelsea |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705055057/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3227800/title/agreement-reached-for-transfer-of-van-ginkel |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fee reported to be in the region of £8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23148099 |title= Chelsea set to complete deal for Marco van Ginkel |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, Chelsea confirmed that they had completed the signing of Van Ginkel, with the Dutch international midfielder signing a five-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229499/title/van-ginkel-signs |title=VAN GINKEL SIGNS |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708070811/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229499/title/van-ginkel-signs |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the official Chelsea website upon his signing with the club, Van Ginkel described himself as "a box-to-box player" who "covers a lot of metres and can score a goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229543/title/first-words-marco-van-ginkel |title=First Words: Marco van Ginkel |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708070812/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3229543/title/first-words-marco-van-ginkel |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
On the opening day of the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season, Van Ginkel made his competitive debut for Chelsea as a substitute against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/10241983/Chelsea-2-Hull-City-0-match-report.html|title=Chelsea 2 Hull City 0: match report|date=18 August 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=Henry|last=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2013, he played his first [[UEFA Champions League]] game in a 2–1 home defeat by [[FC Basel|Basel]]. On 24 September, in a [[2013–14 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], Van Ginkel suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|injury]] that kept him out of play for around seven months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10335638/Chelseas-Marco-van-Ginkel-expected-to-be-out-for-six-to-nine-months-after-tearing-anterior-cruciate-ligament.html|title=Chelsea's Marco van Ginkel expected to be out for six to nine months after tearing anterior cruciate ligament|date=26 September 2013|work=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his competitive return to football in Chelsea's under-21s' match away to Manchester United on 21 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2586509/Chelsea-youngster-Van-Ginkel-returns-injury-U21-clash-United.html|title=Chelsea youngster Van Ginkel returns from injury in U21 clash with United|publisher=Mail Online |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Milan====
On 1 September 2014, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] announced that Van Ginkel had joined the [[Serie A]] club on loan from Chelsea for the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15 season]]. During his loan spell, Van Ginkel wore the number 21 jersey, formerly owned by some of the great names of the club such as [[Andrea Pirlo]] and [[Mauro Tassotti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2014/8/31/6091101/chelsea-fc-transfer-news-marco-van-ginkel-joins-ac-milan |title=Done deal, Marco van Ginkel joins AC Milan|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his first appearance for Milan on the bench against [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 14 September 2014, but he did not make his debut until 23 September. On 23 September, he made his first start, as well as his debut, for Milan against [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]]. His debut, however, was cut short as he was taken off on a stretcher in the 34th minute after suffering an ankle injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/09/23/italy/serie-a/empoli-fc/ac-milan/1836161/ |title=Empoli vs. Milan  2 – 2|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/9/23/6835013/chelsea-fc-ac-milan-injury-news-marco-van-ginkel-taken-off-on-a-stretcher |title=Marco Van Ginkel taken off on a stretcher, Fernando Torres scores|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his injury, Van Ginkel made his way back on the bench on 19 October, as Milan faced [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]], but was an unused substitute. Van Ginkel would continue to be left on the bench without a single minute of game time, leading his agent, Karl Jansen, to speak out: "We aren't happy about that is clear. It [leaving Van Ginkel out] went against all logic. Marco didn't have to go to Italy, if he wasn't going to be used anyway. Milan agreed with that. A fit and in-form Van Ginkel plays his way into Milan's starting XI."
After Jasen speaking out for Van Ginkel, rumors started around about the possibly of Van Ginkel returning to Chelsea, or going on loan for another team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/11/4/7154787/marco-van-ginkel-ac-milan-loan |title=Van Ginkel agent troubled by Milan treatment|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November, Van Ginkel was finally deemed fit enough to start for Milan in a match against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. He played nearly the entire game, being substituted off for [[Riccardo Montolivo]] in the 89th minute in a 2–0 Milan victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/30/italy/serie-a/ac-milan/udinese-calcio/1836349/|title=Milan vs. Udinese  2 – 0|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following game, on 7 December, Van Ginkel was again left on the bench as an unused substitute as Milan crashed into a 1–0 defeat against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/12/07/italy/serie-a/genoa-cfc/ac-milan/1836365/|title=Genoa vs. Milan  1 – 0|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel took a turn for the worst as he picked up an ankle injury during practice caused by teammate [[Sulley Muntari]]. The tackle from Muntari was described as "hard challenge, but it was not a violent challenge" by head coach [[Filippo Inzaghi]]; with the injury, Van Ginkel was ruled out for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2014/12/15/7393511/more-bad-news-for-marco-van-ginkel|title=More bad news for Marco van Ginkel|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ginkel made his return to the bench on 18 January 2015, but it was not until 24 January that Van Ginkel made his return onto the pitch, playing against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]; he was substituted off in the 55th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/24/italy/serie-a/ss-lazio-roma/ac-milan/1836487/|title=LAZIO VS. MILAN  3 – 1|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ginkel played every minute in the league since 4 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/04/04/italy/serie-a/us-citta-di-palermo/ac-milan/1836667/|title=PALERMO VS. MILAN  1 – 2|date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 9 May, he scored the opener in a 2–1 home victory over [[A.S.

==Style of play==
Van Ginkel primarily plays as a central midfielder but has been lauded for his ability to play in a multitude of positions including defensive midfield and across the attacking midfield.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} From his early playing days at Vitesse, he has primarily played in an attacking role, though he has matured in his ability to play in a deeper defensive role. Van Ginkel is recognized as a solid, well-rounded player who has all the tools of a future superstar. On the pitch he is widely known for his maturity on the ball, impressive ball control and an extensive range of passing. He is comfortable with both feet, makes intelligent runs into the box and has an exceptional long-range shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/marco-van-ginkel-profile-chelsea-2028133 |title=Marco van Ginkel profile: Chelsea new boy can become 'a hybrid of Frank Lampard and vintage Michael Essien' |publisher=Mirror Football |accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ginkel has described himself as "a real box-to-box player. I can score goals but I can also be important to defense." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2395634/Marco-van-Ginkel-looking-make-flying-start-Chelsea.html |title=He's a cross between Lampard and Gerrard and Dutchman Van Ginkel is looking to make a flying start at Chelsea |publisher=Mail Online |accessdate=27 November 2013 |location=London |first=Matt |last=Barlow |date=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] spoke of the youngster, likening him to [[England national football team|England]] greats [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Steven Gerrard]]. He has described Van Ginkel as an engine with immense physical power. As with several others, Mourinho was quick to point out his overall game: "He covers a fantastic area of the field defensively and after that he has this instinct where he wants to go into finishing areas, he wants to score goals. He’s very good in the air."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
