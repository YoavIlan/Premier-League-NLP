==Club career==
===Derby County===
====2011–12 season====
Hughes made his debut for the club's reserve team as a 70th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 6–1 [[The Central League#Division One Central|Central League]] win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] on 22 September 2011&lt;ref name="walsallreserves"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby County Res 6–1 Walsall Res| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2444297,00.html| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =22 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made two additional appearances in the [[The Central League#Central League Cup|Central League Cup]]. It was his "outstanding"&lt;ref name="portvalereserves"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby County Res 1–0 Port Vale Res| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2500904,00.html?| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =1 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; performance in a 1–0 win over [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] reserves in the competition on 1 November which brought him to manager [[Nigel Clough]]'s attention for possible inclusion in the Derby first-team squad against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] four days later.&lt;ref name="hughesinsquad"/&gt;

Hughes made his full debut for Derby as a 90th-minute substitute for [[Jamie Ward]]. Despite entering the match late with the scores level, there was still time for Hughes' first-team debut to end in defeat as a 94th-minute goal saw Peterborough win 3–2.&lt;ref name="peterborodefeat"&gt;{{cite web| title =Peterborough United 3 – 2 Derby County| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~58235,00.html| archive-url =http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110116024428/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10270%7E58235%2C00.html| dead-url =yes| archive-date =16 January 2011| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Derby midfielder [[Paul Green (footballer, born 1983)|Paul Green]], who was out-of-contract at the end of the season, rejected a contract offer, Clough dropped him and promoted Hughes to the first-team squad as his replacement for the penultimate match of the season at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name="pompey"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Clough-cast-net-Green-turns-offer/story-15866524-detail/story.html| title =Clough to cast net after Green turns down offer| newspaper =Derby Telegraph| date =20 April 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120422082108/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Clough-cast-net-Green-turns-offer/story-15866524-detail/story.html| archivedate =22 April 2012| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes started the match on the substitute's bench and came on in the 68th minute, replacing [[Theo Robinson]] in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref name="pompeygame"&gt;{{cite web| title =Portsmouth 1–2 Derby County| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~59014,00.html| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes started his first match for the senior team in the final match of the season, a 1–1 draw against Peterborough United.&lt;ref name="firststart"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby County 1–1 Peterborough United| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~59299,00.html| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =28 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' performance match earned praise from Derby manager Nigel Clough.&lt;ref name="cloughpraise"&gt;{{cite web| title =Clough Impressed By Hughes Display| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2754789,00.html| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =30 April 2012| access-date =1 May 2012| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120502201320/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2754789,00.html#| archive-date =2 May 2012| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Derby's awards night, Hughes won the Scholar of the Year Award.&lt;ref name="2012awards"&gt;{{cite web| title =Bryson Named Club Player of the Year| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2754942,00.html| publisher =Derby County F.C.| date =2 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
After impressing in pre-season, Clough said that Hughes could be in line for a place in the starting line-up in the first match of [[2012–13 Derby County F.C. season|the season]] against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref name="frame"&gt;{{cite web| title ='Will Hughes is in frame for Derby County starting line-up'| url =http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Hughes-frame-Derby-County-starting-line/story-16669813-detail/story.html| newspaper =Derby Telegraph| date =8 August 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120813102631/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Hughes-frame-Derby-County-starting-line/story-16669813-detail/story.html| archivedate =13 August 2012| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clough was particularly impressed with his substitute appearance against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] saying, "When he came off the bench at Colchester, he was very good indeed. I thought he was the star of the subs. He looked comfortable. I don't think he gave the ball away and he made our equaliser. We are very pleased with him."&lt;ref name="frame"/&gt;

Hughes scored his first goal for the club in a 5–1 win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 1 September 2012.&lt;ref name="goal1"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby 5–1 Watford| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19378170| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes signed a new contract in October 2012, committing his future at the club until summer 2015.&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite web| title =Hughes Pens New Rams Deal| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/hughes-commits-to-the-rams-434969.aspx| publisher = Derby County F.C. | date = 20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes scored his second goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 10 November, scoring an equalising goal from 20 yards.&lt;ref name="goal2"&gt;{{cite web| title =Millwall 1–2 Derby| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20189961| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 10 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Hughes was linked with moves to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and Manchester City.&lt;ref name="nov12links"&gt;{{cite news | title =Derby County teenager Will Hughes attracts Premier League interest ahead of possible England debut| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9673363/Derby-County-teenager-Will-Hughes-attracts-Premier-League-interest-ahead-of-possible-England-debut.html| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Clough denied the rumours,&lt;ref name="nov12denial"&gt;{{cite web| title =No bids for promising Ram| url =http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/no-bids-promising-ram-185755004.html| publisher =Yahoo!

Hughes was named the [[Football League Young Player of the Month]] for November 2012, after a series of impressive performances.&lt;ref name="FLYPotM"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hughes named Young Player of the Month | url = http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/20121221/hughes-named-young-player-of-the-month_2293322_3015087 | publisher = The Football League | date = 21 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130319215632/http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/20121221/hughes-named-young-player-of-the-month_2293322_3015087 | archivedate = 19 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the 2013 January transfer window, it was reported in the ''[[Derby Telegraph]]'' that Hughes was being closely observed by 10 [[Premier League]] clubs with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s manager [[Martin Jol]] saying of Hughes, "Believe me, there are probably 10 clubs in the Premier League having a look at him. He is one of these wonderful talents, so he is always on lists. If you have a good scouting system, he will always be on the list but we will see."&lt;ref name="martinjolcomments10"&gt;{{cite web| title =Fulham boss Martin Jol one of 10 with eyes on Will Hughes| url =http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fulham-boss-Martin-Jol-10-eyes-Hughes/story-17691095-detail/story.html |newspaper=Derby Telegraph | date = 27 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, during a 0–0 draw against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Hughes picked up a groin injury and was replaced after 63 minutes. As a result of this injury, Hughes ended his ever-present run of Derby first-team appearances after 35 matches and ended a run of 37 consecutive appearances.&lt;ref name="march13inj"&gt;{{cite web| title =Midfielder Will Hughes ruled out of Derby County's tough double header| url =http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Midfielder-Hughes-ruled-Derby-County-s-tough/story-18265227-detail/story.html |newspaper=Derby Telegraph | date = 27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With twelve matches remaining in the season and with Derby unlikely to fight for a play-off place and with Hughes being ruled out for the first two matches in March;&lt;ref name="march13inj"/&gt; Clough said he considered resting Hughes for the rest of season to reduce stress on his body.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In April 2013, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract after his 18th birthday, extending his stay until June 2016.&lt;ref name="deal1year"&gt;{{cite web| title =Hughes Extends Derby Contract| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/hughes-extends-derby-contract-778500.aspx| publisher = Derby County F.C. | date = 18 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes returned to first-team action before schedule on 20 April as an 85th-minute substitute in Derby's 3–1 against Peterborough United.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby 3–1 Peterborough| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133302| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 20 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Hughes won the [[Sammy Crooks]] Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref name="ypoy13"&gt;{{cite web | title=Keogh Named Club Player of the Year| publisher=Derby County F.C. | url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/keogh-named-club-player-of-the-year-803602.aspx| date = 2 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Hughes made his first appearance for the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] squad in a friendly against [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Northern Ireland U21]] on 13 November.&lt;ref name="u21sqaud"&gt;{{cite web| title =England U-21 ring changes for Northern Ireland friendly| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20255047| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes came on as a 65th-minute substitute for [[Josh McEachran]], becoming the second youngest player to get capped for the U21s,&lt;ref name="u21debut"&gt;{{cite web| title =Hughes Gains England Under 21 Honours| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/hughes-gains-england-under-21-honours-485320.aspx| publisher =Derby County F.C. | date = 13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; beaten only by [[Theo Walcott]].&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt; Derby youth academy director [[Darren Wassall]] praised Hughes after his call-up to the England U21 side, saying "It's a great achievement to get in at 17 and we are all delighted for him. To make that rise into the Under-21s so soon is fantastic for him and everyone at the club."&lt;ref name="praisewassall"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby's Will Hughes can "come alive" for England Under-21s| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20272033| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes called the experience "surreal".&lt;ref name="hughesu21surreal"&gt;{{cite web| title =Will Hughes: England call surreal says Derby teenager| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20340777| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Hughes has been described as a "flair player" who uses through balls and mazy runs to create space for teammates and beat opposition defences in attacking positions.&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"&gt;{{cite web| title =Derby's Will Hughes – the Championship's latest sensation| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20769208| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes said in a December 2012 interview for the BBC, that he bases his play on Barcelona and [[Spain national football team|Spanish international]] central midfielders [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]].&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt; Hughes states his strengths are his passing and technical ability and targeted improvements in pace and physical strength.&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt;

Hughes' former England U21 coach [[Stuart Pearce]] described Hughes as "technically a very sound player". "He rarely gave the ball away in training or in the game he played [against Northern Ireland], which is vitally important at international level. He's progressing really well."&lt;ref name="bbcdec12interview"/&gt;
