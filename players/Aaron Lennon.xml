'''Aaron Justin Lennon''' (born 16 April 1987) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

He began his career at hometown club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], making his first-team debut in 2003 and becoming the youngest player to play in the Premier League at that time. In 2005, he moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for £1&amp;nbsp;million, where he made 364 appearances across all competitions and scored 30 goals. In 2008, Lennon won his first major honour, the Football League Cup, as Tottenham emerged victorious with a [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2–1 win]] over London rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. In September 2015, he joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for £4.5&amp;nbsp;million, after his successful spell with the club on [[Loan (sports)|loan]].

Lennon made his senior debut for the [[England national football team|English national team]] in 2006, and has been selected by England for two World Cups.

==Early life==
Born in [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Lennon has one older brother and a younger sister and brother and is of Irish and Jamaican heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/180771/Robert-Green-plays-golf-and-finds-a-ball-game-he-can-get-to-grips-with |title=Robert Green plays golf and finds a ball game he can get to grips with |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |first=David |last=Pilditch |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="englandplayers.netprofile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandplayers.net/football/aaronlennon/index.html |title=England Players Profiles – Aaron Lennon |publisher=EnglandPlayers.net |accessdate=26 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115235/http://www.englandplayers.net/football/aaronlennon/index.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended City of Leeds High School, but then attended [[Boston Spa School]] due to the fact that the school was closer to [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]] so it was easier for him to focus on both GCSEs and his football career.&lt;ref name="englandplayers.netprofile" /&gt; He was first spotted by scouts when he was eight years old; his older brother Anthony played for Manchester United's youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-391043/Englands-silent-hero.html |title=England's silent hero |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |first=James |last=Mills |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
In 2001, Lennon joined the [[Leeds United F.C. Reserves and Youth Team|Leeds United Academy]].&lt;ref name="football top-profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballtop.com/players/aaron-lennon |title=Aaron Lennon. Biography |publisher=Footballtop.com |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set a record as the youngest player ever to have his boots sponsored when he signed up with [[Adidas]] at the age of just 14.&lt;ref name="football top-profile" /&gt; Two years later, he began his professional career at Leeds United, where he became the youngest player to appear in the [[Premier League]] at the age of 16 years and 129 days, coming off the bench at [[White Hart Lane]] against Tottenham Hotspur in a 2–1 loss in August 2003.&lt;ref name="Leeds debut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3152277.stm |title=Kanoute grabs Spurs winner |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2003 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon scored his only goal for Leeds against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2004 during a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4107129.stm |title=Sunderland 2–3 Leeds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 December 2004 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon had been featuring from the bench up until that point, but he soon took his chance when [[John Oster]] was sacked for bad behaviour, becoming a regular starter from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/4128427.stm |title=Leeds sack Oster after incident |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb0405/&gt; His pace and skills on the wing excited Leeds fans, and he was one of the star performers in Leeds' first season in the Championship under the management of [[Kevin Blackwell]] with his performances earning rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-lennon-was-sold-on-the-cheap-deane-1-5340783 |title=Leeds United v Tottenham Hotspur: Lennon was sold on the cheap – Deane |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |location=Leeds |first=Leon |last=Wobschall |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last involvement at Leeds was playing and scoring in [[Lucas Radebe]]'s testimonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socceramworld.com/lucas-radebe-testimonial/4.html |title=The Lucas Radebe Testimonial |publisher=Soccer AM World |date=2 May 2005 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826233750/http://www.socceramworld.com/lucas-radebe-testimonial/4.html |archivedate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Leeds' financial problems, Lennon was sold to Spurs for a heavily reduced fee, with a sell-on clause inserted into the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/hull-city/tigers-target-former-leeds-teenager-lennon-to-join-relegation-battle-1-7064322 |title=Tigers target former Leeds teenager Lennon to join relegation battle |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
[[File:Aaron lennon25.jpg|thumb|upright|Lennon in 2008]]

With Leeds suffering financial difficulties, Lennon made a £1&amp;nbsp;million move to Tottenham Hotspur on 15 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2013-2014/aaron-lennon-poised-for-everton-switch_sto4587518/story.shtml |title=Everton sign Aaron Lennon on loan from Spurs |publisher=Eurosport |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Spurs debut came a couple of months later in a 2–0 home defeat against Chelsea on 27 August 2005.&lt;ref name="spurs-debut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4168856.stm |title=Tottenham 0–2 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2005 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2006, Lennon scored his first Premier League goal in Tottenham's 2–0 victory over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/report?id=185769&amp;cc=3436 |title=Birmingham 0–2 Tottenham |publisher=ESPN FC |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was nominated by fellow players for the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]] Young Player of the Year for both the [[2005–06 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2006–07]] seasons, but lost out to [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], respectively.&lt;ref name="pfa-2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4903072.stm |title=Chelsea head list of PFA nominees |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6582201.stm |title=Ronaldo secures PFA awards double |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with Tottenham on 8 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/6242677.stm |title=Lennon signs long-term Spurs deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2008, Lennon won his first major career honour as Tottenham came from a goal down to defeat Chelsea 2–1 after extra time at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008 League Cup Final]].&lt;ref name=2008LC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7256729.stm |title=Tottenham 2–1 Chelsea |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved deal was signed in March 2009 which contracted him to Spurs until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/mar/20/aaron-lennon-tottenham-contract |title=Lennon extends Spurs deal to 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon finished the 2008–09 season as the Tottenham Fans' Player of the Season, the club's Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season, and was nominated for a third successive year for PFA Young Player of the Year, this time losing out to Ashley Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8019726.stm |title=Giggs earns prestigious PFA award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 47 matches in all competitions and scored five goals, including a late equaliser in a memorable [[North London derby]] which ended 4–4 and was manager [[Harry Redknapp]]'s first match in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7684610.stm |title=Arsenal 4–4 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs finished eighth in the league and reached the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 League Cup Final]], which they lost on penalties to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a goalless draw at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref name=2009LC&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7905889.stm |title=Man Utd 0–0 Tottenham (aet) |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His goals early in the [[2009–10 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2009–10 season]] – against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]], and Birmingham City – kept Tottenham at the top of the league table with four successive wins, their best start to a league season since the [[1960–61 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1960–61]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_5527728,00.html |title=Crouch – All up four grabs |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2009, Lennon was injured in a match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. Tottenham were consequently reduced to ten men as manager Harry Redknapp had used all three available substitutes and they would go on to lose the match 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8317280.stm |title=Tottenham 0–1 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Ian |last=Hughes |date=24 October 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on 22 November in a 9–1 victory against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and provided three assists and scored one goal. He was substituted in the 79th minute for [[David Bentley]], receiving a standing ovation from the fans at White Hart Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8365091.stm |title=Tottenham 9–1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon suffered a groin injury in December 2009 which kept him out of the team during the first months of 2010 and in the run up to the [[2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/8529463.stm |title=Aaron Lennon out for six weeks with injury – Redknapp |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return from injury in a 3–1 defeat against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] on 24 April 2010, appearing as a second-half substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-3-1-tottenham-report-3359272 |title=Manchester United 3–1 Tottenham: Two Giggs penalties and a Nani stunner keep Fergie's title hopes alive |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2010, he scored a last minute winner in a 2–1 victory against [[Liverpool]] at White Hart Lane after a [[Benoît Assou-Ekotto]] long ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/nov/28/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league |title=Aaron Lennon's late blast sees Tottenham sink Liverpool |newspaper=The Guardian |first=David |last=Hytner |location=London |date=28 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2011, Lennon went on a blistering run as Tottenham counter-attacked and then delivered a perfect pass to assist [[Peter Crouch]] in a 1–0 win over [[A.C.

[[2016–17 Everton F.C. season|The new season]] had a more frustrating feel as Lennon found himself well down the pecking order when new boss [[Ronald Koeman]] took charge of the club. Lennon had played just 14 minutes of football during the first two months of Everton's league campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/time-evertons-aaron-lennon-come-12081522 |title=Is it time for Everton's Aaron Lennon to come in from the cold? |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |first=Glen |last=Williams |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his first league start coming on 19 November 2016 in a home match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-team-news-aaron-lennon-12201121 |title=Everton team news – Aaron Lennon and James McCarthy start against Swansea City |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |date=19 November 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnley===
On 23 January 2018, Lennon signed for Premier League club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42792135 |title=Lennon completes move to Burnley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 January 2018 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lennon was called up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21 team]] for the first time in October 2005 and on 8 May 2006, he was picked in [[England national football team|England]]'s [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] squad, despite being only 19 years of age and uncapped at senior level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/08/newsstory.sport7 |title=Eriksson gambles on Walcott |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 May 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |location=London |first=Sean |last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named [[man of the match]] in the [[England national football B team|England B]] encounter against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] on 25 May 2006 in England's World Cup warm-up match at the [[Madejski Stadium]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], which England B ultimately lost 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/commentary?gameId=198168 |title=England B vs. Belarus B – Football Match Commentary |publisher=ESPN FC |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full England debut as a second-half substitute in the 6–0 win over [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] on 3 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/players/player=69587/profile/index.html |title=Aaron Lennon |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon appeared as a second-half substitute for England in their 2006 World Cup group stage match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] (his first World Cup finals appearance). England scored twice following his and Wayne Rooney's arrival on the field, winning the match 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853008.stm |title=England 2–0 Trinidad &amp; Tobago |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon then played in the quarter-final match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], coming on as a substitute for the injured [[David Beckham]]. Lennon was then himself substituted for [[Jamie Carragher]] immediately prior to a penalty shootout, in which England lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991618.stm |title=England 0–0 Portugal (Portugal win 3–1 on penalties) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon also came on as a substitute during a 5–0 [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Euro 2008 qualifying]] victory over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] on 2 September 2006 and made an instant impact by assisting Peter Crouch's second goal after receiving the ball for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5289630.stm |title=England 5–0 Andorra |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start for England in a Euro 2008 qualifier against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in March 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-458774/Lennon-undergoes-surgery.html |title=Lennon undergoes surgery |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}} and was also selected in the first XI for the following match against Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6497817.stm |title=Andorra 0–3 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be Lennon's last appearance for exactly two years as it wasn't until 28 March 2009 that he was selected again by England, starting in a friendly match with [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/5062756/Aaron-Lennon-hits-his-stride-at-just-the-right-time-to-give-England-cutting-edge.html |title=Aaron Lennon hits his stride at just the right time to give England cutting edge |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Alan |last=Smith |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7967094.stm |title=England 4–0 Slovakia |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=28 March 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon started again for England when they played [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] on 1 April 2009 at Wembley Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7973880.stm |title=England 2–1 Ukraine |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called up for the friendly against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|World Cup qualifier]] versus [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], following his fine form for Tottenham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8229098.stm |title=Capello recalls Crouch and Lennon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named man of the match in the 5–1 win over Croatia, their biggest defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1212480/Aaron-Lennon-booked-World-Cup-place-Croatia-display-says-England-captain-John-Terry.html |title=Aaron Lennon has booked his World Cup place with Croatia display, says England captain John Terry |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}
