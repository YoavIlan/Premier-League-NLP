'''Daniel William John Ings''' (born 23 July 1992) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from fellow {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Ings started his career in the youth team of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined [[AFC Bournemouth]], progressing through their youth system, while also spending time at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] on loan. In 2011 Ings joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] with whom he won the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 Championship]] Player of the Year, and helped them achieve promotion to the Premier League. Following Burnley's relegation, and the expiry of his contract with the club, Ings moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2015, but his first season at [[Anfield]] was ended after two months due to injury. His second season with Liverpool was also mired by injury, with Ings only making two League Cup appearances throughout the 2016–17 season. Ings joined Southampton on loan in August 2018, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.

Formerly an [[England national under-21 football team|under-21 international]], Ings made his senior debut for England in October 2015.
