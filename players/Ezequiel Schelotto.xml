'''Ezequiel Matías Schelotto''' ({{IPA-it|skeˈlɔtto}}; born 23 May 1989) is an Argentine-Italian [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for Italian club [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo Verona]], on loan from [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. He is nicknamed ''El Galgo'' ("The Greyhound" in Spanish) because of his running skills or, less frequently, ''El Mosquetero'' ("The Musketeer").

==Club career==
===Cesena===
Schelotto joined [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]] side [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]] in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=826:i-convocati-per-il-ritiro-di-castrocaro&amp;catid=9:squadra&amp;Itemid=126|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040223/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=826%3Ai-convocati-per-il-ritiro-di-castrocaro&amp;catid=9%3Asquadra&amp;Itemid=126|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 March 2012|title=I convocati per il ritiro di Castrocaro|date=20 July 2008|accessdate=2 November 2010|publisher=AC Cesena|language=Italian|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in April 2009, his transfer was finally cleared by [[FIFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1739:arrivato-il-transfer-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=124|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040229/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1739%3Aarrivato-il-transfer-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1%3Anews&amp;Itemid=124|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 March 2012|title=Arrivato il transfer di Schelotto|date=4 April 2009|accessdate=2 November 2010|publisher=AC Cesena|language=Italian|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that season, following his approved transfer, Schelotto played six matches out of a possible seven for Cesena, scoring one goal and helping Cesena to promotion back up to the second tier [[Serie B]].

===Atalanta===
====Cesena (loan)====
In June 2009, Schelotto was signed by [[Serie A]] side [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] on a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal for €250,000&lt;ref name=Cesena2010bilancio&gt;AC Cesena SpA ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2010 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in July 2009, he was instantly loaned back to his previous club, Cesena. During the [[2009–10 Serie B]] campaign, Schelotto made 40 league appearances for the side, scoring six goals. Of his 40 matches, 33 of them were from the starting XI. He earned just €82,750 in 2009–10 season.&lt;ref name=TNAS/&gt;

On 24 June 2010, Schelotto was signed outright by Atalanta for an additional €2.5 million fee,&lt;ref name=Cesena2010bilancio/&gt; which were just relegated to the Serie B following an 18th-place finish during the [[2009–10 Serie A]], whilst Cesena earned their second consecutive promotion as the club earned promotion to the top flight following a top three Serie B finish. Following his purchase, the player was again loaned back to the [[Emilia-Romagna]]-based club, along with veteran midfielder [[Fabio Caserta]] and central defender [[Maximiliano Pellegrino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3511:accordo-con-latalanta-per-la-cessione-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=124|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727115620/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3511%3Aaccordo-con-latalanta-per-la-cessione-di-schelotto&amp;catid=1%3Anews&amp;Itemid=124|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 July 2011|title=Accordo con l'Atalanta per la cessione di Schelotto|date=24 June 2010|accessdate=31 January 2011|work=AC Cesena|language=Italian|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto wage was also increased significantly. As he left the club in January 2011, he earned €268,333.31 from Cesena for the first 7 months of 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name=TNAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coni.it/images/arbitrati2012/515_A.pdf|title=Dott. Augusto Carpeggiani / Sig. Ezequiel Matias Schelotto|date=6 June 2012|access-date=27 September 2016|work=Tribunale Nazionale di Arbitrato per lo Sport|publisher=Italian National Olympic Committee|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelotto had a bitter Serie A season with Cesena, one in which the team started brightly, even topping the league table by round three, but then endured a landslide that saw the team drop to 18th place and into the relegation places by November. He lost his starting place on 24 October as the coach used [[Luis Antonio Jiménez|Luis Jiménez]] as a new supportive striker in the three forward formation. Since then, he only made four starts to replace [[Giuseppe Colucci (footballer)|Giuseppe Colucci]] (who was injured) and [[Stephen Appiah]] (twice), respectively, as one of the midfielders. His last start — and last match — with Cesena was on 23 January 2011, a match where Cesena fielded an inferior squad against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] where the three forwards, Schelotto, [[Igor Budan]], and [[Dominique Malonga]], were not regular starters.

During the first half of the 2010–11 campaign, Schelotto made 17 league appearances with one goal. On 31 January 2011, he was transferred to Serie A side [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] on loan.

====Catania (loan)====
On 31 January 2011, Schelotto transferred to Catania in Sicily, on loan from Atalanta. In his transfer deal, Catania were sold the option to sign the player on a co-ownership basis at the conclusion of the current campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciocatania.it/article.php?id=21979|title=Matias Ezequiel Schelotto al Catania|date=31 January 2011|access-date=27 September 2016|publisher=Calcio Catania|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto started his first match for the Sicilians on 6 February 2011, a match that Catania lost 1–0 away to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], in part due to an early red card by Argentine defender [[Pablo Sebastián Álvarez|Pablo Álvarez]].

====Return to Atalanta====
Schelotto returned to Atalanta on 1 July 2011. He was included in the first team squad of Atalanta for [[2011–12 Serie A]] campaign, which the club was promoted back to the top tier as the champions of Serie B in May 2011. During his 1½ seasons with the Serie A club, he earned a transfer to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano]] for €6 million transfer fee in January 2013, despite in a cash-plus-player deal.

===Internazionale===
Schelotto joined Italian giants [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] on 31 January 2013 for €3.5 million cash plus 50% "card" of [[Marko Livaja]] (Inter valued 50% rights of Livaja for €2.5 million but bought the rights back from Cesena for €1.5 million cash).&lt;ref&gt;AC Cesena S.p.A. ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FC Internazionale Milano SpA ''bilancio'' (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; Schelotto made his debut on 3 February in a 3–1 loss against [[A.C. Siena|Siena]], playing the first 45 minutes before giving way to [[Mateo Kovačić]]. He scored his first goal for the club in the 1–1 draw against city rivals Milan on 24 February 2013.

Schelotto spent two seasons on loan to other Italian clubs from 2013–14 season to 2014–15 season; on 31 August 2015, it was agreed between the two parties Schelotto would terminate his contract by a mutual consent.

====Sassuolo (loan)====
On 29 August 2013, Schelotto signed on loan with Serie A side [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/43567|title=Transfers, Schelotto moves to Sassuolo|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=11 June 2014|publisher=FC Internazionale Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September he scored his first league goal for Sassuolo in a 2–2 draw with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=377254|title=Sassuolo vs. Lazio – Football Match Report – September 29, 2013 – ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parma (loan)====
On 22 January 2014, Schelotto joined [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] along with his Sassuolo compatriot, [[Jonathan Rossini]], signing on a loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fcparma.com/news/lad-leonardi-sul-calciomercato-operazioni-vantaggiose-sul-campionato-guardo-sempre-davanti?lang=en|title=Jonathan Rossini and Ezequiel Schelotto presented by general manager Pietro Leonardi|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=Parma FC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222063615/http://fcparma.com/news/lad-leonardi-sul-calciomercato-operazioni-vantaggiose-sul-campionato-guardo-sempre-davanti?lang=en|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chievo (loan)====
On 25 August 2014, Schelotto joined [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]] on a seasons long loan.

====Sporting C.P.====
On 20 November 2015, Schelotto joined Portuguese side [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] on a three-and-a-half year contract, after being released by Internazionale in the summer of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.football-italia.net/76004/sporting-sign-schelotto|title=Sporting sign Schelotto|work=Football Italia|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezequiel Schelotto 2017.jpg|thumb|Schelotto playing for [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].]]
On 31 August 2017, Schelotto completed a transfer to [[Premier League]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], signing a three-year contract at the south coast club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2017/august/albion-sign-argentine-defender/|title=Albion Sign Argentine Defender|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Official Site|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chievo (loan)====
On 28 January 2019, Schelotto joined to [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo Verona]] on loan until 30 June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/ufficiale-chievo-verona-fatta-per-il-ritorno-di-schelotto-1207447|access-date=28 January 2019|title=UFFICIALE: Chievo Verona, fatta per il ritorno di Schelotto|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Thanks to his Italian ancestry, Schelotto was eligible for Italian [[citizenship]]. In November 2009, he was called up to the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian national under-21 team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cesenacalcio.it/notizie/news/ezequiel-schelotto-convocato-nellunder-21.html |title=Ezequiel Schelotto convocato nell'Under 21 |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-09 |publisher=AC Cesena |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722030742/http://www.cesenacalcio.it/notizie/news/ezequiel-schelotto-convocato-nellunder-21.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately featured in the starting lineup in a game against [[Hungary national under-21 football team|Hungary]] on 13 November.

Since making his debut, he played all available [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification]] matches, and unusually as right back in the last qualification match against Wales in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/azzurri/2010/09/07-127847/Europei+U.21,+l'Italia+vince+e+si+qualifica+per+i+playoff|title=Europei U.21, l'Italia vince e si qualifica per i playoff|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=11 September 2010|work=Corriere dello Sport – Stadio|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that match, Italy beat [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] 1–0 and narrowly topped Wales as the group winner. He assisted [[Stefano Okaka]] to score the second goal in the first leg of the playoff round against [[Belarus national under-21 football team|Belarus]], but missed the second leg due to suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.football-italia.net/oct09w.html|title=U-21: No replacements|date=9 October 2010|work=Football Italia|accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy were eventually eliminated due to a 0–3 loss against Belarus in [[Barysaw|Borisov]].

On 10 August 2012, he was called up by [[Cesare Prandelli]] to the [[Italy national football team|Italian senior team]] for a friendly against [[England national football team|England]], where he made his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 2–1 Italy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19238374|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Born in [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name=BDFutbol/&gt; Schelotto also holds an Italian passport due to his Italian descent from [[Cogoleto]] ([[Province of Genoa|GE]]), in [[Liguria]], where his great-great-grandfather Giovanni Battista Francesco Schelotto emigrated from in the late 19th century. He is the fifth of seven children — including 5 males — two of whom are also footballers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/Sport/514179/|title=Schelotto, parla il "levriero": "Dopo il ko ci rialzeremo"|publisher=ecodibergamo.it|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/node/11937|title= Schelotto wants Azzurri career |publisher=football-italia.net|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
