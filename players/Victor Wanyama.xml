'''Victor Mugubi Wanyama''' ({{IPA-all|wɑˈɲɑːmɑ|[[Kenyan English]]:|Victor Mugubi Wanyama.ogg}}; born 25 June 1991) is a Kenyan professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and captains the [[Kenya national football team|Kenyan national team]].&lt;ref name="Captain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/23267053 |title=Celtic's Victor Wanyama has joined Southampton, say Kenyans |work=BBC Sport |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama became the first ever Kenyan player to score in the [[UEFA Champions League]] when he scored the first goal in [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s 2–1 win over [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on 7 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/224/652/3/ |title=Wanyama: Saints' sights on Europe |work=FIFA |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2013, Wanyama moved to Premier League club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for £12.5 million making him the most expensive player sold by a Scottish club, surpassing the £9.5 million Russian club [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] paid for [[Aiden McGeady]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague=england-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/213/511/7/index.html |title=Southampton in record swoop for Wanyama |work=FIFA |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has earned over 50 caps for the [[Kenya national football team|Kenyan national team]] since making his international debut in May 2007 at the age of 15.

== Early life ==
Wanyama attended Kamukunji High School, which fields a successful football team. Upon leaving High School, he also played with JMJ Academy for three years during which time he also joined [[Kenyan Premier League]] clubs [[Nairobi City Stars]] and [[AFC Leopards]].&lt;ref name=Cement&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/InsidePage.php?id=2000000305&amp;cid=38&amp;story=Mugabe%20wants%20to%20cement%20position%20in%20Belgium%20club Mugabe wants to cement position in Belgium club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132405/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/InsidePage.php?id=2000000305&amp;cid=38&amp;story=Mugabe%20wants%20to%20cement%20position%20in%20Belgium%20club |date=4 March 2016 }} Standard Digital, 5 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he joined [[Allsvenskan]] club [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]] but after the departure of his brother [[McDonald Mariga]] to [[Serie A]] side [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] in 2008, Wanyama returned to Kenya.

== Club career ==

=== Beerschot AC ===
After a successful trial, Wanyama signed for [[K. Beerschot AC|Beerschot AC]] on a four-year contract in summer 2008. He made his debut in a League match at the end of the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|2008–09 season]]. In September 2009, he was fined €100 and given a three-match suspension for a violent tackle on [[Matías Suárez]] of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=44838 Wanyama suspendu trois matchs (Wanyama suspended three games)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AV6dTJkR?url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=44838 |date=7 September 2012 }} Footgoal, 29 September 2009 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2010 [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] attempted to sign Wanyama but Beerschot did not allow him to leave. Russian club [[CSKA Moscow]] also attempted to sign him, but they failed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=57331 Wanyama va rester au Germinal Beerschot (Wanyama stays with Germinal Beerschot)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819044505/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=57331 |date=19 August 2010 }} Footgoal, 16 April 2010 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama scored his first goal for Beerschot on 11 December 2010, a 77th-minute equaliser against Westerlo. In April 2011, he received another three match suspension after video evidence showed he had elbowed Brecht Dejaeghere of [[K.V. Kortrijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=67175 Wanyama poursuivi (Wanyama continued)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AV6iiuF7?url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=67175 |date=7 September 2012 }} Footgoal, 18 April 2011 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2011, Wanyama finally completed a £900,000 move to Celtic, after the Scottish club had failed to sign him the previous year.&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;{{cite news

On 20 October 2012, Wanyama scored twice against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] at [[St Mirren Park]], the second of which was a half volley from 25 yards out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinical Celtic warmed up for the Nou Camp with what turned out to be little more than a training exercise as they outclassed a feeble St Mirren |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19939572 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 October 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, Wanyama's agent released a statement saying that he had turned down an improved contract offer from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], stating that his wage demands could not be met by the club amid speculation of interest from clubs in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scottish Football – Wanyama rejects Celtic deal |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/scottish-football-wanyama-rejects-celtic-deal-185103875.html |work=Eurosport |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=26 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128003423/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/scottish-football-wanyama-rejects-celtic-deal-185103875.html |archivedate=28 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November, Wanyama opened the scoring with a powerful header as [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] shocked [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage, by beating them 2–1 at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1855396.html |title=Debutant Watt lights up memorable Celtic victory |work=UEFA |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southampton ===
[[File:Victor Wanyama 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Wanyama with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2014]]

After much speculation and a previous breakdown in talks, on 11 July 2013, Wanyama signed for [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for a fee claimed to be £12.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=  Victor Wanyama: Southampton sign Celtic midfielder for £12.5m  | url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22969633| publisher=BBC Sport| date=11 July 2013 | accessdate= 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the first Kenyan to ever play in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wanyama makes Saints switch | url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/wanyama-makes-saints-switch-909448.aspx | publisher=Southampton FC | date= 11 July 2013| accessdate= 11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanyama said: {{centred pull quote|Southampton is a good club and it has good players, so I just want to train hard and work hard to be a part of the starting XI. We'll see where that will take me. It feels great and I am happy to be here. There were other options, but Southampton is a club with ambitions so I chose to come here. I'm very grateful to be here and I'm looking forward to playing in the Premier League.}}

He made his debut on 17 August 2013, in 1–0 away win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Brom 0–1 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644676 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wanyama made 24 appearances in his first season, but injuries hindered his efforts to make much of an impact in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Wanyama desperate for Saints to end with record breaking tally|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/11160909.Victor_Wanyama_desperate_for_Saints_to_end_with_record_breaking_tally/|publisher=Daily Echo|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
