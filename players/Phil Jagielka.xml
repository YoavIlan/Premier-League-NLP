Jagielka is also the captain of Everton.

Jagielka started his career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 2000, where he played mainly as a [[central midfielder]]. He helped them achieve top-flight status for the [[2006–07 Sheffield United F.C. season|2006–07 season]], after which he joined Everton for a £4&amp;nbsp;million fee.

He has received 40 England caps since his debut in 2008 and was included in the England squads at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Jagielka was born in [[Manchester]]&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and attended [[Knutsford Academy]]. He played for Holy Family Football Club, a Sunday team affiliated with, although not directly linked to, the school of the same name, from the ages of eight to 11. He played as a right winger, as he possessed great pace, and even played in matches against boys of the school year older than him. However, he first impressed youth scouts whilst playing for his local team [[Hale Barns]] United in [[Altrincham]]. He predominantly played midfield during his time with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1132676/From-time-keeper-England-centre-half--rise-rise-Phil-Jagielka.html|title=From time keeper England centre half rise rise PhilJagielka|accessdate=20 March 2009 | location=London | newspaper=Daily Mail | first=Matt | last=Lawton | date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}} He also played for his school team, Moorlands Junior School, playing any position including in goal and with boys 2 school years above him.&lt;ref&gt;Moorlands Junior School&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the academy of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a youngster and spent time training with clubs such as [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1998 at 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shail|first=Mark|title=Jagielka has got his sights set on the Premiership|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/championship/jagielka-has-got-his-sights-set-on-the-premiership|publisher=givemefootball.com|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=17 November 2005}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Sheffield United===
Jagielka made his way through the youth ranks at Sheffield United before making his first-team debut on 5 May 2000 against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the final [[Football League First Division|First Division]] match of the [[1999–2000 Sheffield United F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], whilst still a trainee. He was rewarded with a professional contract the following day and having progressed well at the start of the following season, he signed a three-year deal with the club in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warnock hails teenage ace |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/1108377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 January 2001 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He established himself in the Sheffield United first-team in the [[2002–03 Sheffield United F.C. season|2002–03 season]] and started to attract the attention of other clubs, including [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], who were linked with a £6&amp;nbsp;million joint bid for Jagielka and United teammate [[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]], but Sheffield United said they would resist any attempts to sign the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades deny Leeds approach |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/3153119.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2003 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka stated in April 2005 he was happy to stay at United, despite several [[Premier League]] clubs being interested in signing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jagielka wants to stay at Blades |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4432967.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; United manager [[Neil Warnock]] told [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in June 2005 that Jagielka would not be sold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades warn Hammers off Jagielka |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4115204.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] made a £4&amp;nbsp;million bid for Jagielka, after which United upped their valuation of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewell unhappy over Jagielka bid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4724037.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November, Jagielka had been linked with a £4&amp;nbsp;million move to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], but United manager Neil Warnock said there had been no contact from Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fudge|first1=Simon|title=Blades deny fresh Jags links|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11672/2353563/blades-deny-fresh-jags-links|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka signed a new three-year deal with United in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jagielka commits future to Blades |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/5266726.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played as team captain in [[Chris Morgan (footballer)|Chris Morgan]]'s absence. Jagielka gave United their first Premier League victory since April 1994 when he hit a 91st minute half-volley against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for a 2–1 win in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheff Utd 2–1 Middlesbrough |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/5373476.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |first=Sophie |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being recognised as one of United's key players, chairman [[Kevin McCabe (businessman)|Kevin McCabe]] admitted that Jagielka could be sold if the price was high enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades may sell Jagielka |url=http://www.football.co.uk/sheffield_united/blades_may_sell_jagielka_238477.shtml |publisher=Football.co.uk |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a home match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 30 December 2006, due to a thigh injury to starting goalkeeper [[Paddy Kenny]] and with his team 1–0 up, Jagielka was forced to play in goal for the remainder of the match. Arsenal were kept at bay for the remaining 34 minutes and Jagielka's late save from [[Robin van Persie]] secured the 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheff Utd 1–0 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6205685.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 December 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to deputise in goal meant that Neil Warnock was able to – and usually did – do without a substitute goalkeeper on the bench in order to give himself more tactical options (League rules then limited the number of substitutes to 5).

By the end of the [[2006–07 Sheffield United F.C. season|2006–07 season]], he had made 133 consecutive league appearances for United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The lowdown – Everton v Wigan|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/the-lowdown-everton-v-wigan.html|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=22 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930022736/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/the-lowdown-everton-v-wigan.html|archivedate=30 September 2012|date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; including every league match in the [[2004–05 Sheffield United F.C. season|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 Sheffield United F.C. season|2005–06]] seasons and every minute of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name=guardian070512/&gt; When Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2006–07 season, Jagielka was linked with moves away from United and goalkeeper Paddy Kenny said he believed it was time Jagielka moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenny feels Jagielka should leave |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/6709039.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; New United boss [[Bryan Robson]] urged Jagielka to wait for the outcome of the club's relegation arbitration hearing before deciding to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blades call to Jagielka |url=http://www.football.co.uk/sheffield_united/blades_call_to_jagielka_247725.shtml |publisher=Football.co.uk |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
====2007–2012====
[[File:Phil Jagielka 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Jagielka playing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2011]]

Jagielka eventually signed for Everton on 4 July 2007, in a deal worth £4&amp;nbsp;million on a five-year contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everton secure deal for Jagielka |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/6270146.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest amount ever paid for a Sheffield United player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prentice|first=David|title=Jagielka factfile|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/other-sport/jagielka-factfile-3480991|newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=12 July 2008|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his home debut at [[Goodison Park]] on 31 July 2007 as a second-half substitute in a pre-season friendly against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], replacing [[Joseph Yobo]] in central defence. After a slow start to his Everton career, Jagielka developed into an important member of the first team. He scored his first Everton goal in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] against [[AZ Alkmaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7145803.stm |title=AZ Alkmaar 2–3 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |first=Caroline |last=Cheese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored an own goal against Wigan Athletic, although Everton won 2–1. He put in a succession of man of the match performances in the following matches, against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[SK Brann|Brann]] and Manchester City. He scored his first league goal for Everton against Reading on 9 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7223966.stm |title=Everton 1–0 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2010 |first=Ian |last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka started the 2008–09 season as first-choice centre back, playing every minute of every league match until being injured in a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester City. He was named the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for February&lt;ref name=PL&gt;{{cite web |title=Phil Jagielka: Overview |url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/3222/Phil-Jagielka/overview |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won Everton's fans and club player of the season.&lt;ref name=evertonawards&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards Winners|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/awards-winners|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka scored the winning penalty for Everton in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], but he was claimed to have fouled [[Danny Welbeck]] after 68 minutes, with many claiming it to be a penalty, which the referee did not award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/7990227.stm|title=Man Utd 0–0 Everton (aet) |date=19 January 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he ruptured his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] playing against Manchester City, and as a consequence missed the [[2009 FA Cup Final]], which Everton lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

After missing the end of the 2008–09 season and more than half of 2009–10, Jagielka played his first senior fixture since the cruciate ligament injury in an away match against [[Sporting CP]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in February 2010, coming on as a substitute for an injured [[Philippe Senderos]].

====2013–present====
[[File:Phil Jagielka 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Jagielka playing for Everton in 2014]]

On 3 January 2013, Jagielka signed a new contract at Everton, keeping him at Goodison Park until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England defender Phil Jagielka signs new long-term Everton contract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/03/everton-phil-jagielka-new-contract|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, manager [[David Moyes]] announced that Jagielka would be appointed as the club captain for the [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14 season]] after the retirement of [[Phil Neville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phil Jagielka to succeed departing Phil Neville as Everton captain|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/8633931/phil-jagielka-to-succeed-departing-phil-neville-as-everton-captain|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moyes left for Manchester United, new manager [[Roberto Martínez]] stated that Jagielka would make a "phenomenal captain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.football365.com/everton/8778099/Premier-League-Everton-boss-Roberto-Martinez-backs-Phil-Jagielka-as-captain | title=Martinez: Jagielka suits role | publisher=Football365.com | accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jagielka's first season as captain, Everton amassed a Premier League club record 72 points to finish fifth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/phil-jagielka-everton-even-stronger-7162257 |title=Phil Jagielka: Everton will be even stronger next season under Roberto Martínez |newspaper=North Wales Daily Post |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with him being awarded three accolades at the club: Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season and Goal of the Season.&lt;ref name=evertonprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Phil Jagielka|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/players/p/pj/phil-jagielka|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka reclaimed his place as Everton's starting centre back in March 2017 after [[Ramiro Funes Mori]] suffered a knee injury on international duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2016–17 Everton Player Reviews: Phil Jagielka |url=https://royalbluemersey.sbnation.com/2017/6/7/15745936/phil-jagielka-season-review-everton-ronald-koeman-ashley-williams-ramiro-funes-mori |publisher=Royal Blue Mersey |date=7 June 2017 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Jagielka scored in three successive league matches for Everton: first, in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] on 4 April – his first league goal in two years – then in a 4–2 victory against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at Goodison Park on 9 April, and finally, in a 3–1 home victory over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 15 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39414200|title=Manchester United 1–1 Everton |date=4 April 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Hafez |first=Shamoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39470449|title=Everton 4–2 Leicester City |date=9 April 2017 |accessdate=9 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Henson |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39536681|title=Everton 3–1 Burnley |date=15 April 2017 |accessdate=15 April 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Whalley |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Jagielka is a former member of the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] team, and scored in a 2–0 victory over [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England U21s keep hopes alive|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/england/2976038.stm|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2007, Jagielka was named in the [[England national football B team|England B team]] for the first time, for their match against [[Albania national football team|Albania]]. Starting on the bench, he replaced Phil Neville at right back at the beginning of the second half. On 11 May 2008, Jagielka was named in the [[England national football team|senior England squad]] for the first time for the friendlies with [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7395247.stm |title=Hart &amp; Jagielka in England squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently expressed his delight at the call up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2008/05/13/jags-england-delight |title=Jags' England Delight |publisher=Everton F.C. |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly thanked everyone at Everton for their help. On 1 June 2008, Jagielka got his first international cap for the senior team against Trinidad and Tobago, playing the second half of a match in which England used two different sides for each half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trinidad &amp; Tobago 0–3 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7425208.stm|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka was once again named in the England squad for the friendly match against European champions Spain, 11 February 2009, and subsequently played for the first 45 minutes, after an impressive string of performances at club level publicly praised by manager David Moyes after the FA Cup fourth round replay tie between Everton and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_4898063,00.html|title=David Moyes has praised Phil Jagielka after his performance in the FA Cup win over Liverpool|author=Bailey, Richard|date=5 February 2009|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka received his fourth cap when he played in England's first post 2010 FIFA World Cup friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 11 August 2010 at Wembley Stadium where he scored an own goal to put the visitors ahead in a 2–1 England win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerrard brace saves England from embarrassment |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/38775.html |publisher=ESPN |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2010, Jagielka made his first competitive start, and played for the entirety of the match in a 4–0 win over Bulgaria. He was said to have "read the game brilliantly on a night when he proved his credentials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Daily-Mirror-player-ratings-England-4-0-Bulgaria-Joe-Hart-Phil-Jagielka-and-James-Milner-shine-but-Jermaine-Defoe-takes-Man-of-the-Match-award-article571573.html|title=Daily Mirror player ratings: England 4–0 Bulgaria|date=3 September 2010|newspaper=Daily Mirror|location=London|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up to the England squad once again for the Euro 2012 qualifier against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9056797.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=Capello calls up striker Davies | date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up again for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier and friendly against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] on 26 March and came on in the 88th minute for [[Scott Parker]]. On 12 November, he started as centre-half in a friendly against Spain and gave an exceptional performance as England ground their way to a 1–0 win.

Jagielka was originally placed on the standby list for England's [[UEFA Euro 2012]] squad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18081125 | title=England Euro 2012 squad: Ruddy, Carroll &amp; Defoe in, Ferdinand out |publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 May 2012 | accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played the full match in a pre-tournament warm-up match against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], which England won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18184726 | title=Norway 0–1 England |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 28 May 2012, Jagielka was added to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 squads#England|main squad]] after [[Gareth Barry]] was ruled out of the tournament with an abdominal injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18232535 | title=Euro 2012: England confirm squad numbers |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka did not feature in any of England's four matches during the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/teams/team=39/index.html | title=England Squad | publisher=UEFA | accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Jagielka scored his first goal for England, a diving header during a 2–1 friendly victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="England 2–1 Italy"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19238374 |title=England 2–1 Italy |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2014, Jagielka was named in England's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/12/england-world-cup-squad-hodgson-barkley-sterling |title=England World Cup squad 2014: Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling called up |date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second England goal on 30 May 2014 to wrap up a 3–0 friendly win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] at Wembley, reacting after goalkeeper [[Raúl Fernández (footballer)|Raúl Fernández]] dropped a corner from Jagielka's Everton teammate [[Leighton Baines]].&lt;ref name="England 3–0 Peru"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 3–0 Peru |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27383301 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; England were unbeaten in 11 competitive matches in which Jagielka has played in (won eight and drawn three), until they lost 2–1 to Italy in their opening match of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2624125/Phil-Jagielka-England-World-Cup-profile.html |title=Phil Jagielka – England World Cup profile |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285071 |title=England 1–2 Italy |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=14 June 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagielka scored his third England goal, and first in a competitive fixture, on 9 October 2014; his header opened a 5–0 Wembley win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group E|UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref name="England 5–0 San Marino"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29454223 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagielka became the first Everton player to captain England when they played against Lithuania on 12 October 2015 in a UEFA Euro qualifying match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-england-captaincy-short-story-10242155|title=Everton and the England captaincy: A short story|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|first=David|last=Prentice|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2016, he became the most capped Everton player by England when he came on as a second-half substitute against Spain in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beesley|first=Chris|title=Everton captain Jagielka breaks Alan Ball's record|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-captain-jagielka-breaks-alan-12182878|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
