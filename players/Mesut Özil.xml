He is considered to be one of the best players in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/02/ranking-the-20-best-players-in-the-premier-league-october-2016/mesut-ozil/ | title=Ranking the best players in the Premier League | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=2 November 2016 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/13/mesut-ozil-still-one-best-players-world-says-arsene-wenger/ | title=Özil still 'one of the world's best' says Wenger | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=13 October 2017 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ozil-is-one-of-the-best-players-in-the-world-under-fire/1l89o8e6gg6dn1bfaik226ji20 | title=Özil still 'one of the world's best' says Reus | publisher=Goal | date=25 June 2018 | accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil plays mostly as an attacking midfielder, but can also be deployed as a winger. He began his senior career as a member of his hometown club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in the [[Bundesliga]], departing two seasons later to join [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] for €5 million. He garnered break-out attention at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], where at age 22, Özil was instrumental in the side's campaign where they reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. He was also nominated for the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball Award]], as well as being ranked first in assists in major European and domestic competitions, with 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imscouting.com/global-news-article/The-top-10-assists-leaders-in-Europe-for-201011/13447/ | title=The top 10 assists leaders in Europe for 2010⁄11 | publisher=imscouting.com | date=30 May 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This garnered him a €15 million transfer to [[La Liga]] club [[Real Madrid]].

At Madrid, Özil won the [[Copa del Rey]] in his first season, before registering a league high 17 assists as the Spanish side won the league title in the [[2011–12 La Liga|following season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/assists/_/league/ESP.1/year/2010/spanish-primera-division?cc=5901 | title=Spanish La Liga | publisher=EXPN Soccernat | accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the [[Supercopa de España]] in the same season, becoming renowned for his technical skills and creativity; due to his agility, finesse and versatility as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], he has also been compared to [[Zinedine Zidane]] by former manager [[José Mourinho]].&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/primera-liga/news/detail/item807157/Mourinho:-Ozil-will-make-history-at-Real/|title=Mourinho: Ozil will make history at Real|publisher=ESPNSTAR.com|date=26 May 2012|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a second-place La Liga finish to rivals [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2012-13 La Liga|2012–13]] season, Özil relocated to England to join [[Premier League]] side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a then club-record deal worth £42.5 million (€50 million),&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/german-international-ozil-joins-arsenal|title=German international Özil joins Arsenal|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive German player of all time]].&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23929339 |title=Mesut Özil: Arsenal sign Real Madrid midfielder for £42.4m |publisher=BBC |date=2 September 2013 | accessdate = 4 September 2013 | first = David | last = Ornstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/234697.html |title= Arsenal smash club record to sign Mesut Özil |date=2 September 2013 |work=The Guardian | accessdate = 4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first season, Özil helped end the club's largely publicised [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1966–present)|nine-year trophy drought]], winning the [[2014 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] in 2014. He later became victorious in two more FA Cup campaigns, while also winning the [[FA Community Shield]]. Özil would also record the second most assists (19) in a Premier League season in [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15]], as well as being named in multiple teams of the season in England.

At international level, Özil played 92 matches for the Germany national team, scoring 23 goals, and registered 40 assists. He has also won a record five German Player of the Year awards. Özil represented his country in three [[FIFA World Cup]]s, as well as two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, and was an integral part in both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and [[UEFA Euro 2012]] team in South Africa and Ukraine, starring as the joint-highest assist provider in both competitions. Özil was also a key contributor as Germany won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, gaining several plaudits for his versatility and creativity. After the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Özil [[Mesut Özil#Retirement controversy|retired from international competition]], alleging discrimination and disrespect by the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) and the German media.

==Club career==
===Schalke 04===
After plying his trade at youth level for various clubs in [[Gelsenkirchen]], including a five-year stint for [[Rot-Weiss Essen]], Özil moved to the youth system of [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in 2005. He was deployed a midfielder and wore 17 as his squad number, after starting as a playmaker and central attacking midfielder in the place of the suspended [[Lincoln (footballer)|Lincoln]] in [[Ligapokal]] matches against [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/artikel/352932|title=Ein 17-Jähriger soll Lincoln ersetzen|publisher=kicker.de|language=German|accessdate=13 November 2007|date=27 July 2006|author=Jean-Julien Beer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon making the first team at Schalke, he was described as "the next big thing". However, soon after declining an offer from Schalke 04, claiming that a yearly salary of €1.5 million would not be enough, he eventually fell out with club management and moved on to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in January 2008.&lt;ref name="Mesut Özil Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/84775/mesut-ozil?cc=5901|title=Mesut Özil Bio|publisher=espnsoccernet.com|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to [[Mirko Slomka]], the then-Schalke 04 manager, claiming that Özil would not play another match for Schalke 04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/kurzpaesse-ewerthon-nach-barcelona-kuffour-nach-amsterdam-a-531698.html | title=Kurzpässe: Ewerthon nach Barcelona, Kuffour nach Amsterdam | work=Der Spiegel | date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Werder Bremen===
[[File:Mesut Özil Werder Bremen.jpg|thumb|upright|Özil with [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in April 2010]]
On 31 January 2008, Özil moved to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] for a reported fee of {{€|5 million}}, signing a contract with the German club until 30 June 2011. Other than Werder Bremen, [[Hannover 96]] and [[VfB Stuttgart]] were reportedly interested as well in binding Özil to their respective clubs, however did not want to pay such a high transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/millionen-deal-bremen-verpflichtet-schalker-oezil-a-532301.html | title= Millionen-Deal: Bremen verpflichtet Schalker Özil | work= Der Spiegel | date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After transferring to Werder Bremen, Özil got the jersey number 11. On 26 April 2008 (30th match day) Özil scored the go-ahead goal in the 33rd minute against [[Karlsruher SC]], to put his team up 2–1. This was Özil's very first Bundesliga goal. He played in twelve games throughout the second half of the season, six times playing in the starting formation, becoming second with Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga at the end of the 2007–08 season.

Although Bremen failed to get going in their 2008–09 Bundesliga season, eventually finishing a disappointing tenth, Özil managed to make a significant impact in most games and came away with a respectable three goals and 15 assists that highlighted his attacking credentials.&lt;ref name="Shapland, Dave"/&gt; He helped lead the North German club to the [[2009 DFB-Pokal Final|2009 DFB-Pokal]] with the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4to40.com/wordpress/biographies-for-kids/mesut-oezil/|title=Mesut Oezil|publisher=4to40.com|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also excelled in Europe where he led Werder Bremen to the final of the last ever [[UEFA Cup]], losing out to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Shapland, Dave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_47_787_bundesliga-player-profile-mesut-ozil-werder-bremen.html|title=Bundesliga player profile – Mesut Ozil, Werder Bremen|last=Shapland|first=Dave|publisher=adifferentleague.co.uk|date=28 November 2009|accessdate=9 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119215410/http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_47_787_bundesliga-player-profile-mesut-ozil-werder-bremen.html|archivedate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009–10 season, Özil became the key playmaker of Werder Bremen, stepping into the shoes of Brazilian [[Diego (footballer, born 1985)|Diego]] who had left for [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], was named the best player of the first leg of the 2009 Bundesliga season.&lt;ref name="Real profile English"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193041476158/1330012508587/jugador/Jugador/Ozil.htm|title=Mesut Özil|publisher=Real Madrid C.F|accessdate=27 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428162816/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193041476158/1330012508587/jugador/Jugador/Ozil.htm|archivedate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2010, the 33rd match day, Özil played his 100th Bundesliga game, scoring the 1–0 lead in a 2–0 win against his former club Schalke 04. Özil went on and led Werder Bremen to become third in the league and again to the DFB-Pokal final, however this time it was lost against Bayern Munich by 0–4. In his [[2009–10 Bundesliga|second season]], Bremen finished a respectable third, with Özil contributing 9 goals and 17 assists in 31 league fixture appearances. During the 2009–10 season, Özil was also declared as the "best player of the first half of the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportschau.de/sp/kurzmeldungen.jsp?meldung=7&amp;popup | title=Sportschau.de: Wahl – Mesut Özil ist Spieler der Hinrunde | publisher=Sportschau | language = German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928021958/http://www.sportschau.de/sp/kurzmeldungen.jsp?meldung=7&amp;popup |archivedate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real Madrid===
====2010–11 season====
[[File:Mesut ozil v drese realu madrid.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Özil playing for [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in 2010]]
Due to his performances in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Özil ensured his place among Europe's top young talents. He was sought by teams like [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. English striker [[Wayne Rooney]] was one of the many admirers Özil had garnered with his performances in the World Cup, and had even asked [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] to sign the German playmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/ferguson-wayne-rooney-sign-mesut-ozil-book | title = Sir Alex Ferguson: 'Wayne Rooney wanted me to sign Mesut Özil' | work = The Guardian | date = 22 October 2013 | accessdate = 29 March 2014 | first = Owen | last = Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports claiming that a deal was struck for a transfer to Barcelona, but Werder Bremen denied the reports and on 17 August 2010, the team announced that they had reached an agreement with Real Madrid for Özil's transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1330010084519/noticia/Noticia/Mesut_Ozil_to_play_for_Real_Madrid.htm|title=Mesut Özil to Play for Real Madrid|accessdate=17 August 2010|publisher=Real Madrid C.F.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819014107/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1330010084519/noticia/Noticia/Mesut_Ozil_to_play_for_Real_Madrid.htm|archivedate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee is believed to have been in the region of €15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8921836.stm|title=Real Madrid confirm signing of Germany star Mesut Ozil|publisher=BBC sport|date=17 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing, Özil said, "When the offer came in to join Real Madrid, there is no decision to make. Let's be honest – you don't refuse this club. I was in no rush to leave Werder Bremen, but this is one club you say yes to. They are an institution, a club with a fantastic history, stadium and squad full of world-class players. The prospect of performing at the Bernabéu is so awesome you jump straight in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=821820&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;root=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5901|title=Mesut Ozil Interview: Real Madrid's new star|date=10 September 2010|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil made his debut on 22 August in a friendly match against [[Hércules CF|Hércules]], which Real Madrid won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2010/08/22/2082959/hercules-1-3-real-madrid-benzema-brace-seals-friendly|title=Hercules 1–3 Real Madrid: Benzema Brace Seals Friendly Triumph|publisher=Goal.com|date=22 August 2010| accessdate=23 August 2010|last=Madden|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; His jersey numbers were changed often before the season started. He was given the number 26 in the pre-season and 19 for his debut. But following the transfer of [[Rafael van der Vaart]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], he was given the vacant 23.

Özil was brought in to back up teammate [[Kaká]], but due to his surgery, Özil obtained a starting role. He then made his La Liga debut for Real Madrid as a substitute for [[Ángel Di María]] in the 62nd minute against [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]], which Real Madrid drew 0–0.&lt;ref name="Real Madrid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1330012984541/noticia/Cronica/1330012984541.htm |title=Report: The Whites make their debut in the 2010/11 edition of La Liga |accessdate=16 September 2010 |publisher=Real Madrid C.F. |date=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902025048/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1330012984541/noticia/Cronica/1330012984541.htm |archivedate=2 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mesut Özil and Daniele Bonera.jpg|thumb|right|Özil taking on [[Daniele Bonera]] of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] during the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]]]]
He made his season debut in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] on 15 September.

He finished atop the [[2011–12 La Liga|La Liga]] assists chart, with 17 assists. On 2 May 2012, he helped Real Madrid to clinch a record 32nd [[La Liga]] title as he assisted Real's first goal and scored the second goal against Bilbao, which Real Madrid later won by 3–0. Eleven days later, Özil scored two goals in the final game of the regular season against Mallorca, once again consolidating his excellent performance with the club. The win made Real the first club in the Spanish top flight to ever reach 100 points in a single season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/323691?cc=5901|title=Ton-up Real set new landmark|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fine form with Real Madrid and German national team saw him earn nomination for [[UEFA Best Player in Europe Award]], in which he finished tenth, being the youngest player to feature in the Top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iniesta, Messi, Ronaldo up for Best Player Award|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1842518.html|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=8 June 2017|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====

At the end of the season, Özil had 26 assists, more than any other player in the leagues.

===Arsenal===
[[File:Mesut Özil Arsenal (4).jpg|thumbnail|Özil taking a free kick for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 22 September 2013]]
On 2 September 2013, Özil agreed to join English side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-1" /&gt; Both the fee paid for Özil as well as the contract duration were undisclosed, but they are believed to be around £42.5&amp;nbsp;million (€50&amp;nbsp;million) for a five-year deal.&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-2" /&gt; The transfer makes him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive German football player of all time]].&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-3" /&gt; Özil was assigned the number 11 shirt and the centre-attacking midfield role by the team.&lt;ref name="Arsenal-sign-4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2409704/Mesut-Ozil-signs-Arsenal-did-Real-Madrid-bully-Germany-star-42-5million-tramsfer.html|title=Did Real Madrid 'bully' Ozil into joining Arsenal?

Özil said of the transfer, "At the weekend, I was certain I would stay at Real Madrid but afterwards I realised I did not have the faith from the coach or the bosses. I am a player who needs this faith and that is what I have felt from Arsenal, which is why I have joined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/with-arsene-wengers-belief-i-can-get-even-better--mesut-ozil-8796397.html |title='With Arsene Wenger's belief I can get even better' – Mesut Ozil |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |newspaper=London Evening Standard | first = James | last = Olley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Özil's first press conference, he said: "I would have come here for free, that wouldn't have been a problem."

Özil made his debut for Arsenal in their league game away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 14 September 2013. He assisted [[Olivier Giroud]]'s goal in the 11th minute of the match as they went on to win 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23999428 |title=Sunderland 1–3 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after that, he made his [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut for Arsenal against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24044269 |title=Marseille 1–2 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |last=Magowan |first=Alistair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over three weeks after making his debut for Arsenal, he made his [[Emirates Stadium|home]] debut against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in a 3–1 victory. He was involved in all three goals, with two assists and a free kick which was saved but fell into [[Aaron Ramsey]]'s path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24098512 |title=Arsenal 3–1 Stoke City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |last=Magowan |first=Alistair}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Arsenal, a brilliantly controlled finish from a Ramsey cross, in a 2–0 win against [[S.S.C.

The German playmaker provided the cross for [[Jack Wilshere]]'s second goal against Marseille and gave further assists for Aaron Ramsey and [[Mathieu Flamini]] in the 3–0 win over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. Özil missed the chance to score his fourth Arsenal goal when he saw his penalty in the win over Marseille saved by [[Steve Mandanda]].&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

In October, Özil was again short-listed for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award, along with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/ballondor/news/newsid=2207371/ | title = Men's shortlists for FIFA Ballon d'Or 2013 revealed | publisher = FIFA | date = 29 October 2013 | accessdate = 29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil was also featured on the [[UEFA Team of the Year]]. Özil began December with two goals in as many games against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. A minor shoulder injury forced him out of the final game of December in a win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. After the 6–3 defeat at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in which he made another assist, Özil was involved in an altercation with teammate [[Per Mertesacker]], who was angry with Özil's failure to thank the travelling supporters, an omission for which he subsequently apologised via Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/266435.html |title=Ozil apologises to Arsenal fans |publisher=ESPN |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bevan |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25383956 |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger plays down importance of Man City loss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil started four of Arsenal's six games in January. The playmaker missed Arsenal's victory over Cardiff City on New Year's Day with a shoulder injury before returning to make a late appearance from the bench against Tottenham Hotspur in the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. The 25-year-old produced a slide-rule pass for [[Lukas Podolski]] to score his first goal against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and provided the ball for [[Santi Cazorla]]'s goal against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at the end of the month to take his assist tally to 10.&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

February was a difficult month for Özil, as he struggled to reach the heights he showed in his first few months at the club. The German playmaker pulled off a brilliant piece of skill to win a penalty against Bayern Munich in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|Champions League knockout phase]], but his spot-kick was saved by [[Manuel Neuer]]. Speaking before the draw with Manchester United, Arsène Wenger spoke about Özil, saying, "He has done well, he is adapting as well to the Premier League – we have seen it before [that it takes time]. I wouldn't like to put too much pressure on him because he has been a top-class player until now. He didn't have the best of games [at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]] (a 5–1 loss, where Özil was the centre of attention due to a bad performance) but that can happen. He works very hard to adapt to the physical level of the Premier League and for me he is an exceptional player."&lt;ref name="Arsenal profile" /&gt;

On 8 March, Özil scored his first goal of 2014 in a 4–1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/08/arsenal-everton-fa-cup-live-mbm|title=Arsenal v Everton: FA Cup – as it happened|date=8 March 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil was showing signs of old form and started in Arsenal's second leg Champions League last 16 clash with Bayern Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cryer |first=Andy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26505997 |title=Bayern Munich 1–1 Arsenal (agg 3–1) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was substituted at half-time, and the reasoning behind it was that Özil had suffered a hamstring injury and will face a month out, missing key fixtures against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ornstein |first=David |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26544491 |title=Mesut Ozil: Arsenal's record buy out for month with hamstring injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil played all three of Arsenal's remaining fixtures during the last month of his debut season in England. The German playmaker came off at half-time in extra-time of Arsenal's [[2014 FA Cup Final]] victory over Hull at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27354148| title=Arsenal 3–2 Hull|publisher=BBC Sport| accessdate = 18 May 2014 | date = 17 May 2014 | first = Phil | last = McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking before the FA Cup final, Per Mertesacker praised his compatriot's impact on the side during his first season in England.

After entering January with six months remaining on his contract, which would allow him to engage in pre-contract negotiations with any club, Özil assisted in a win over Crystal Palace, and also assisted in a loss in the reverse fixture against Swansea City on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42672226|title=Arsenal 4–1 Crystal Palace|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42784104|title=Swansea 3–1 Arsenal|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, he re-signed with the club on a three-year extension, keeping him contracted until 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42885533|title=Mesut Ozil: Arsenal midfielder signs new contract until 2021|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported his salary more than doubled to £350,000 per week, making him the highest-paid player in Arsenal's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espn.co.uk/football/arsenal/story/3369152/arsene-wenger-paying-mesut-ozil-mega-salary-was-cheapest-option-for-arsenal | title = Wenger: Paying Ozil mega salary was 'cheapest option' for Arsenal | publisher = ESPN | date = 2 February 2018 | access-date = 5 February 2018 | first = Mattias | last = Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/01/31/mesut-ozil-signs-new-350000-a-week-deal-become-arsenals-highest/ | title = Mesut Ozil agrees new £350,000-a-week deal to become Arsenal's highest paid player | website = The Telegraph | date = 31 January 2018 | access-date = 5 February 2018 | first = Jeremy | last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42885533 | title = Mesut Ozil: Arsenal midfielder signs new contract until 2021 | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 31 January 2018 | access-date = 5 February 2018 | first = David | last = Ornstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
Following the departure of [[Jack Wilshere]], Özil returned to wearing the number 10, for the new season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/24/mesut-ozil-proudly-shows-off-no-10-shorts-arsenal-team-mate-alexandre-lacazette-7755433/|title=Mesut Ozil proudly shows off his No. 10 shorts to Arsenal team-mate Alexandre Lacazette|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=11 August 2018|publisher=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named one of Arsenal's vice-captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11469681/laurent-koscielny-named-arsenals-main-captain-by-head-coach-unai-emery|title=Emery names Koscielny main captain|accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil scored his first goal of the season in Arsenal's 2–1 away win over Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45456658 | title = Newcastle United 1-2 Arsenal: Granit Xhaka's free-kick sets Gunners on way to win | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 15 September 2018 | access-date = 18 September 2018 | first = Harry | last = Poole}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October he captained Arsenal for the first time in a 3–1 comeback win over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

Özil was one of the leading forces in Germany's [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], scoring five times during the campaign as Germany won all ten of its games to top their [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group A|group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season%3D2012/round%3D15171/match%3D2002111/index.html|title=Germany stroll past Austria to reach EURO 2012|publisher=UEFA|date=2 September 2011|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil also confirmed his reputation as a decisive passer, as he provided seven assists, more than any European international during Euro 2012 qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2011/10/11/20895300000.html|title=Die Top-Elf der EM-Qualifikation|publisher=Sportal.de|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=19 October 2011|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014183933/http://www.sportal.de/sportal/generated/article/fussball/2011/10/11/20895300000.html|archivedate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/statistics/index.html|title=Statistics|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his country's chances at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], Özil simply replied, "We have the potential to beat anyone and we have what it takes to win the title."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1028494/ozil-to-receive-german-poty-award?cc=5901|title=Ozil to receive German POTY award|publisher=ESPN FC|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 FIFA World Cup===
[[File:Award ceremony of the World Cup in Brazil 07.jpg|thumb|left|Özil holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] after the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|2014 Final]]]]

Özil ended the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign as Germany's [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Goalscorers|top scorer]] with eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/statistics/topscorers.html |title=Top scorers |accessdate=16 October 2014 |publisher=FIFA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919025443/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/statistics/topscorers.html |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an injury to [[Marco Reus]] in a warm-up game, Özil was moved from his customary number 10 role into the left-winger position for the majority of the tournament. He started all seven of Germany's [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] games, and helped Germany make history by becoming the first European team to win the World Cup in South America. Özil scored the decisive goal in the 119th minute of Germany's 2–1 [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|round of 16]] victory over [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], a match widely praised as one of the most entertaining of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27969924|title=Germany 2–1 Algeria|date=30 June 2014|accessdate=1 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil then provided an assist for [[Sami Khedira]] in Germany's [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7–1 semi-final win over Brazil]]. The goal Özil assisted, with a clever pass, made the score 5–0 to Germany after just 29 minutes. The shocking nature of the 5-goal flurry generated worldwide astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28102403|title=Brazil 1–7 Germany|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], Özil played 120 minutes before being replaced by Arsenal teammate [[Per Mertesacker]]. Germany were crowned World Champions with a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28181689|title= Germany 1–0 Argentina |date=14 July 2014|publisher= BBC Sport|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the trophy was presented to the Germany team, [[UEFA]] President [[Michel Platini]] asked Özil for his match shirt as a souvenir, and Özil obliged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/michel-platini-asked-mesut-ozil-for-his-shirt-during-germanys-world-cup-celebrations-picture/|title= Michel Platini asked Mesut Ozil for his shirt during World Cup celebrations |date=14 July 2014|work= 101 Great Goals|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded the tournament as the leader in passes completed in the final-third (171), was ranked joint-second in chances created (17), behind only [[Lionel Messi]] (23), and ranked second overall in possessions won in the final-third (6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/07/14/stats-things-mesut-ozil-did-better-than-anybody-else-at-world-cu/|title= Things Mesut Ozil did better than anybody else at World Cup |date=14 July 2014|work= HITC Sport|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA Euro 2016===
On 12 June 2016, Özil completed the full 90 minutes of Germany's opening [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] which Germany won 2–0. He assisted [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]]'s goal in the 92nd minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36454267 | title = Germany 2–0 Ukraine | publisher = BBC Sport | first = Alistair | last = Magowan | date = 12 June 2016 | access-date = 23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2016, Özil completed 99% of his passes, created six chances and claimed the Man of the Match award in Germany's win over Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.squawka.com/news/mesut-ozil-completes-99-of-his-passes-in-dominant-display-against-northern-ireland/704308 | title = Özil MOTM |date=21 June 2016|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Özil started in Germany's 3–0 round of 16 win over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].

===2018 FIFA World Cup===
Özil was selected by manager Joachim Löw in Germany's final 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-announce-final-world-cup-squad-with-manuel-neuer-without-leroy-san%C3%A9/a-44064011|title=Germany announce final World Cup squad, with Manuel Neuer, without Leroy Sané|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the national team heavily under-performing as defending champions by being eliminated in the group stages, Özil featured in two of the country's three games, and averaged more chances per 90 minutes (5.5) than any other player in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user=Squawka| number=1021023103332298753| title=Mesut Özil created more chances per 90 minutes (5.5) at the 2018 World Cup than any other player to play at least 90 minutes at the tournament. 11 created in total in 180 minutes of football.|date=22 July 2018| author=Squawka Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement controversy===
In May 2018, Özil, alongside fellow German international [[İlkay Gündoğan]], both of Turkish descent, met with and posed for photographs with Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], in the lead up to the [[2018 Turkish general election|Turkish general election]].

After the nation's World Cup campaign, losing out at the group stage, Özil posted a series of messages on [[social media]] on 22 July, in order to clarify the photograph and address the criticisms he had faced. In a lengthy post, he described the photograph as simply "respecting the highest office of my family's country", while also adding his conversations with Erdoğan revolved solely around their mutual interest in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/nationalelf/728002/artikel_mesut-oezil-tritt-aus-der-nationalmannschaft-zurueck.html|title=Mesut Özil tritt aus der Nationalmannschaft zurück|publisher=kicker.de|language=German|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özil also commented on several media outlets that were using the photograph to push right-wing propaganda, while also selectively criticizing him for his Turkish background, noting the lack of media uproar after [[Lothar Matthäus]] met with Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2018/7/22/17599796/ozil-turkish-president-erdogan-german-politics-arsenal-die-mannschaft-germany-national-team-football|title=Özil speaks, defends meeting with Turkish president and calls out DFB for double-standards|publisher=BavarianFootball|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthäus was subsequently criticized for his meeting with Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sportbuzzer.de/artikel/lothar-matthaus-wladimir-putin-fotos-erklarung/ | title = Doppelmoral-Debatte: Lothar Matthäus erklärt seine Fotos mit Wladimir Putin | language = German | website = Sportbuzzer | date = 8 July 2018 | access-date = 18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/matthaus-shitstorm-putin-foto_de_5b4300cee4b05127ccf3b843 | title = Matthäus bekommt Shitstorm nach Putin-Foto – und schlägt zurück | language = German | website = huffingtonpost.de | date = 9 July 2018 | access-date = 18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later detailed his core issue with the national team stemmed from his interactions with [[Reinhard Grindel]], the DFB president, accusing him of displaying both racism and disrespect on multiple occasions, while also noting similar incidents with other high-profile German nationals, namely Bernd Holzhauer and Werner Steer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination|title=Mesut Ozil walks away from Germany team citing ‘racism and disrespect’| work= [[The Guardian]] |access-date = 23 July 2018 | date = 22 July 2018| first = Tom | last = Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then retired from the team as a form of protest against members of "racially discriminative backgrounds" who work within the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user=MesutOzil1088| number=1020984884431638528| first = Mesut | last = Özil| title=The past couple of weeks have given me time to reflect, and time to think over the events of the last few months.

I pray and my teammates know that they cannot talk to me during this brief period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/fussball-wm2010/ich-habe-nie-angst/1873174.html|title=Mesut Özil: Ich habe nie Angst|first=Michael|last=Rosentritt|date=2 July 2010|work=Der Tagesspiegel|language=German|trans-title=Mesut Özil: I am never afraid|quote=TAGESSPIEGEL: Ihre Art sich direkt vor einem Spiel zu konzentrieren ist es, Verse aus dem Koran leise vor sich hin zu sprechen. MESUT ÖZIL: Das mache ich in der Kabine, bevor wir rausgehen. Ich bete dann und meine Mitspieler wissen schon, dass sie in dieser kurzen Zeit nicht mit mir reden können.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observes fasting during the Islamic month of [[Ramadan]], but he has admitted that: "Because of my job I cannot follow Ramadan properly. I do it only the few days I can, only when I have a free day. But other than that it's impossible, because you have to drink and eat a lot to stay at peak fitness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singh|first=Amar|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2871/special/2011/08/27/2637353/my-manager-told-me-to-choose-between-fasting-or-playing-i|title='My manager told me to choose between fasting or playing – I chose to fast' – how Muslim footballers including Mesut Ozil and Amr Zaki approach Ramadan|publisher=Goal.com|date=27 August 2011|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, he performed ''[[Umrah]]'' pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mesut Ozil visits Muslim holy city Mecca ahead of Euro 2016|url=http://www.squawka.com/news/mesut-ozil-visits-muslim-holy-city-mecca-ahead-of-euro-2016/677656|accessdate=31 May 2016|publisher=Squawka|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match against [[Atletico Madrid]], an Atletico fan threw a piece of bread at Ozil while he was preparing to take a corner. Ozil picked up the bread, kissed it, and brought it to his forehead to express gratitude towards the food given to him, which is important in Islam. His gesture was later widely applauded throughout the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/6155713/mesut-ozil-takes-bite-out-of-baguette-thrown-at-him-during-atletico-madrid-clash/|title=Mesut Ozil kisses bread thrown at him by Atletico Madrid fans during Europa League clash|work=The Sun|date=27 April 2018|access-date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Özil received the [[Bambi (prize)|Bambi award]] for being a prime example of successful integration within German society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-52875620101112|title=Soccer stars steal show at Germany's Bambi Awards|agency=Reuters|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil started dating singer [[Mandy Capristo]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/336628/Mesut-Ozil-s-popstar-girlfriend-Mandy-Capristo-joins-Arsenal-glamour-WAGs|title=Mesut Ozil's popstar girlfriend Mandy Capristo joins Arsenal glamour WAGs| work= Daily Star|date= 4 September 2013| accessdate = 30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship ended in October 2014, following reports of Özil being involved with another woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/mandy-capristo-splits-from-mesut-ozil-after-his-affair/15690161 | title=Mandy Capristo splits from Mesut Ozil after his affair | work=Mid-day | date=17 October 2014 | accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2015, Özil and Capristo appeared together at the Bambi awards ceremony in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-star-mesut-ozil-pictured-6824875 | title= Arsenal star Mesut Ozil pictured with former girlfriend in Berlin after rumoured split last year | work=Mirror | date=13 November 2015 | accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Instagram]] photo uploaded by Özil used the [[hashtag]] #OziStoIsBack, suggesting that the couple is back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/off-the-pitch/arsenal/news/mesut-ozil-back-with-ex-girlfriend-mandy_257191.html | title=Arsenal's Mesut Ozil rekindles relationship with ex-girlfriend Mandy Capristo? | work=Sports Mole | date=13 November 2015 | accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they broke up in 2017 and Özil has been dating former Miss Turkey, [[Amine Gülşe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/news/social/mesut-ozil-gets-super-close-to-former-miss-turkey-amine-gulse/|title=Mesut Ozil gets super close to former Miss Turkey, Amine Gulse|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
As part of the BigShoe project, Özil donated his 2014 World Cup winnings, an estimated £240,000, to pay for 23 sick Brazilian children to have medical surgery as a "personal thank you for the hospitality of the people of [[Brazil]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Kerian|title=Mesut Ozil donates World Cup winnings so 23 children can have surgery in Brazil as 'personal thank you for the hospitality'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2695152/Mesut-Ozil-donates-World-Cup-winnings-23-children-surgery-Brazil.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, international media covered Özil's visit to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, home to around 80,000 people displaced as a result of the Syrian civil war. Özil toured the camp as well as playing with children, signing autographs and handing out football shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3597801/Arsenal-s-Mesut-Ozil-heads-Jordan-kick-starstruck-child-refugees.html | title=Arsenal's Mesut Ozil heads out to Jordan for a kick-about with starstruck child refugees | date=19 May 2016 | access-date = 30 June 2016 | first = Spencer | last = Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he worked with the charity My Shining Star to make a child cancer patient's dreams come true.  He invited the child, Charlie, to be a guest at his private box and in the player's lounge during a game with Sunderland at [[Emirates Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2017/05/09/35365242/charity-thanks-class-ozil-for-making-dream-come-true-for|title=Arsenal news: Charity thanks 'class' Ozil for making dream come true for child with brain tumour |date=9 May 2017|work=''Goal.com''|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and sponsorships===
In 2013, Özil signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/13183-mesut-ozil-adidas-boots.html | title= Mesut Ozil switches to the Three Stripes! | publisher = Footballboots.co.uk | date = 12 July 2013 | accessdate = 1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared in commercials for [[Adidas Predator]] boots with other star players such as [[Lionel Messi]], [[Gareth Bale]], [[Thomas Müller]] and [[James Rodriguez]]. One of those adverts, entitled "Create Your Own Game", was released in August 2015, in which Özil featured alongside those players.&lt;ref name="Adverts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale and Mesut Ozil star in exciting new Adidas advert|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/lionel-messi-gareth-bale-mesut-6207334|date=6 August 2015|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Özil launched his own logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/13820-mesut-ozil-launches-his-own-logo.html | title=Mesut Özil Launches His Own Logo | publisher = Footballboots.co.uk | date = 1 August 2013 | accessdate = 1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Özil's "M" [[goal celebration]] – which is in tribute to his young niece Mira – is included in [[EA Sports]]' ''[[FIFA 17]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United’s Paul Pogba dab, Arsenal's Mesut Ozil dummy and the best Fifa 17 celebrations |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-s-paul-pogba-dab-arsenals-mesut-ozil-dummy-and-the-best-fifa-17-celebrations-a3352696.html |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=REVEALED: The heartwarming meaning behind Ozil's 'M' celebration |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/10/15/28502012/revealed-the-heartwarming-meaning-behind-ozils-m-celebration |accessdate=11 October 2018 |agency=Goal}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''The Magic of the Game / Gunning for Greatness'', was released in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/03/revealed-how-mesut-ozil-pleaded-with-arsenal-manager-arsene-wenger-to-end-his-real-madrid-hell-6485256/ | title= Revealed: How Mesut Ozil pleaded with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to end his Real Madrid hell | work = Metro|location=UK | date = 3 March 2017 | accessdate = 13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-mesut-ozil-jose-mourinho-row-real-madrid-coward-a7607316.html | title= Arsenal's Mesut Özil was called a 'coward' by Jose Mourinho in blistering dressing-room row at Real Madrid | work = The Independent | date = 2 March 2017 | accessdate = 13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
