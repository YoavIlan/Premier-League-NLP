He spent the 2017–18 season on loan to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] of the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].

==Life and career==
===Early life and career===
Bramall was born in [[Crewe]], Cheshire.&lt;ref name=BCFCprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bcfc.com/birmingham-city/players/cohen-bramall/ |title=Cohen Bramall |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |accessdate=23 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823163657/https://www.bcfc.com/birmingham-city/players/cohen-bramall/ |archivedate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career in [[non-League football]] in his local area, with [[Kidsgrove Athletic F.C.|Kidsgrove Athletic]], [[Alsager Town F.C.|Alsager Town]], [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich Town]], [[Market Drayton Town F.C.|Market Drayton Town]]{{snd}}with whom he won the 2015–16 Shropshire Premier Cup in his second spell at the club&lt;ref name=1516ShropPrem&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/marketdraytontown/teams/24359/match-centre/0-3304430 |title=Drayton win T J Vickers Cup in penalty shoot out |first=Cliff |last=Taylor |publisher=Market Drayton Town F.C. |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/non-league/2016/05/04/market-drayton-take-home-the-premier-cup/ |title=Market Drayton take home the Premier Cup |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=4 May 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}and [[Newcastle Town F.C.|Newcastle Town]].&lt;ref name=Pitmenweb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitmenweb.com/playerprofilebramall.htm |title=Cohen Bramall: Defence/Midfield |website=PitmenWeb |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, he moved to [[Northern Premier League]] Premier Division club [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]].&lt;ref name=Pitmenweb/&gt; He played on a part-time basis while working at a [[Bentley]] car factory.&lt;ref name=BBCToArsenal&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38572994 |title=Cohen Bramall: Arsenal sign non-league left-back |date=10 January 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bramall was first offered a trial with [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], appearing with their under-23 side in a match.&lt;ref name=BMailMeet&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/cohen-bramall-birmingham-city-arsenal-13506256 |title=Factory worker, rabonas and Arsenal – meet Birmingham City new boy Cohen Bramall |first=Alex |last=Dicken |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=21 August 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] of the [[Premier League]] were also interested in signing him.&lt;ref name=BBCToArsenal/&gt;

===Arsenal===
After a short trial, Bramall signed professional forms with Premier League club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 9 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20170109/cohen-bramall-joins-arsenal-under-23s |title=Cohen Bramall joins club as young pro |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=9 January 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was officially undisclosed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hednesfordtownfc.com/2017/01/cohen-bramall-makes-arsenal-move |title=Cohen Bramall makes Arsenal move |publisher=Hednesford Town F.C. |date=10 January 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was widely reported as around £40,000.&lt;ref name=BBCToArsenal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/10717289/arsenal-to-sign-hednesford-defender-cohen-bramall-sky-sources |title=Arsenal to sign Hednesford defender Cohen Bramall – Sky sources |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/non-league/hednesford-town-fc/2017/01/10/hednesford-town-youngster-cohen-bramall-officially-joins-arsenal/ |title=Hednesford Town youngster Cohen Bramall officially joins Arsenal |newspaper=Express &amp; Star |location=Wolverhampton |date=10 January 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the remainder of the season playing for the club's [[Arsenal F.C. Reserves|under-23]] side.&lt;ref name=BMailMeet/&gt; During Arsenal's pre-season before the [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18 season]], Bramall joined the first-team squad for the club's tour of Australia and China, making his senior debut in a friendly against [[A-League]] side [[Sydney F.C.|Sydney]].&lt;ref name=BMailMeet/&gt;

====Birmingham City (loan)====
On 21 August 2017, Bramall and Arsenal teammate [[Carl Jenkinson]] were [[loan (sports)|loaned]] to Championship club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] until the end of the season.&lt;ref name=ToBCFC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41000686 |title=Birmingham loan Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson and Cohen Bramall plus Southampton's Sam Gallagher |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bramall made his senior professional debut the next day in Birmingham's starting eleven for their [[EFL Cup]] match against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. He played 78 minutes in a 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/heres-how-birmingham-citys-arsenal-13515491 |title=Here's how Birmingham City's Arsenal loanee Cohen Bramall did on his professional debut |first=Alex |last=Dicken |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=23 August 2017 |accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first [[English Football League|Football League]] appearance in Birmingham's next match, playing the whole of a 2–0 defeat at home to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref name=sb1718/&gt; That was his last appearance until December, when, with central defenders [[Harlee Dean]] suspended and [[Marc Roberts (footballer)|Marc Roberts]] injured, he started at left wing-back in a 1–0 loss away to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fulham-v-birmingham-city-arsenal-14015944 |title=Fulham v Birmingham City: Arsenal loan man comes into makeshift defence at Craven Cottage |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=9 December 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite speculation that the loan might be cut short in the January transfer window,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/cohen-bramall-carl-jenkinson-birmingham-14113518 |title=Cohen Bramall and Carl Jenkinson: Birmingham City boss Steve Cotterill on the Arsenal duo's futures |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=5 February 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he remained at the club, and returned to the league team on 3 February, as a substitute for the injured [[Jonathan Grounds]] in a 3–1 win away to [[Sheffield Wednesday]]. He was involved in an incident for which Wednesday's [[Marco Matias (footballer)|Marco Matias]] was sent off for violent conduct. Former referee [[Mark Halsey]] said afterwards that if there had been a dismissable offence, it was committed by Bramall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/referee-got-wrong-man-birmingham-14250737 |title=Referee 'got the wrong man' in Birmingham City's win at Sheffield Wednesday – ex Premier League official |first=Shane |last=Ireland |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=5 February 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matias' red card was rescinded on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-wednesday/sheffield-wednesday-win-appeal-over-marco-matias-red-card-against-birmingham-city-1-9005473 |title=Sheffield Wednesday win appeal over Marco Matias' red card against Birmingham City |first=Chris |last=Holt |newspaper=The Star |location=Sheffield |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bramall played in two more Championship matches in February, but those were his last.&lt;ref name=sb1718/&gt;
