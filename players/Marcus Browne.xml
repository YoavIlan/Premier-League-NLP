=== Moving up the ranks ===

==== Browne vs. Kalajdzic ====
It was announced that Browne would challenge for his first title, the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC USNBC]] light heavyweight title on April 16, 2016 against fellow undefeated 25 year old [[Radivoje Kalajdzic]] (25-0, 14 KOs) at the Barclays Center in an 8-round bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/spence-algieri-formally-announced-april-16-barclays--101635|title=Spence-Algieri Formally Announced, April 16 at Barclays|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=January 2, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was originally scheduled for 10 rounds, but was cut to 8, minutes before the fight started, due the main event following on. At the time of the fight, Browne was ranked number 7 by the WBA and number 13 by the WBC. Browne won the via a controversial split decision at the end of 8 rounds. Two judges scored the fight 76-74 and 76-75 in favour of Browne, whilst the third judge scored it 76-74 for Kalajdzic. There was controversy from the first round when Kalajdzic fell to the canvas. Browne was credited with the knockdown, although he never threw a punch. Referee Tony Chiarantano was stood behind Browne, most likely misjudged the decision to count the knockdown. In the replay, it shows that Browne landed a punch whilst Kalajdzic slipped. Browne was also dropped in the sixth round. Both fighters claimed they had won in the post fight press conference.
