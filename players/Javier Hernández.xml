'''Javier Hernández Balcázar''' ({{IPA-es|xaˈβjeɾ eɾˈnandez βalˈkasaɾ|-|JavierHernandezBalcazarPronunciation.ogg}};{{efn|In isolation, ''Hernández'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|eɾˈnandes|}}.}} born 1 June 1988) is a Mexican professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for English club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]]. Hernández is commonly known by his nickname, '''Chicharito''' ({{IPA-es|tʃitʃaˈɾito|}}; [[Mexican Spanish]]: ''little [[pea]]''), which he wears on his shirt.

Hernández began his career in 2006, playing for Mexican club [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. In July 2010, he became the first Mexican player to join [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], scoring 20 goals and winning the Premier League in his [[2010–11 Premier League|debut season]]. After falling out of favour under managers [[David Moyes]] and [[Louis van Gaal]], he spent the 2014–15 season on loan at [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. In August 2015, Hernández signed for [[Bundesliga]] club [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]. After two seasons in Germany, Hernández returned to the Premier League and joined West Ham United. His minutes-per-goal ratio is among the most prolific in the history of the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name="goal ratio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/gallery/111326 |title=Best goal ratios of Premier League players |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mexican international, Hernández is the country's [[Mexico national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. He made his debut for the national team in September 2009 in a friendly match against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. He has represented Mexico at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[Copa América Centenario]], the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. He was the 2011 Gold Cup's top scorer with seven goals and was named the most valuable player of the tournament.

==Early life==
Hernández was born in [[Guadalajara]], Jalisco and first played in a recreation league when he was seven years old. Hernández lived in [[Morelia]], [[Michoacán]] for over four years while his father, footballer [[Javier Hernández (footballer, born 1961)|Javier "''Chícharo''" Hernández]], played for [[Monarcas Morelia]].&lt;ref name="Morelia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/la-zanahoria-de-el-chicharito |title=La Zanahoria de el Chicharito |website=''Zocalo.com.mx'' |publisher=Zócalo |language=Spanish |date=15 January 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Morelia, Hernández attended elementary school at the ''Instituto Piaget'' where he studied from third to sixth grade and played for the school's football team.&lt;ref name="Morelia"/&gt;

At the age of nine, Hernández joined [[C.D. Guadalajara]] and signed his first professional contract when he was 15.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/sports/soccer/02soccer.html |title=For World Cup, Javier Hernández Could Be Mexico's Next Big Thing |first=Billy |last=Witz |date=1 April 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was set to play in the [[2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship]], but an injury sidelined him from the team that ultimately won the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/146419/javier-hernandez?cc=5739 |title=Javier Hernández |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst playing football professionally, Hernández was also taking business administration classes at [[Universidad del Valle de Atemajac]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Hernández has held both [[Hugo Sánchez]] and [[Rafael Márquez]] as his football idols growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/722206.chicharito-elogia-a-johan-cruyff-y-rafael-marquez.html |title='Chicharito' elogia a Johan Cruyff y Rafael Márquez |publisher=El Sigoro De Torreón |date=25 March 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latintimes.com/copa-america-centenario-17-things-know-about-mexicos-javier-chicharito-hernandez-387992 |title=Centenario: 17 Things To Know About Mexico's Javier 'Chicharito' Hernández |publisher=Latintimes |date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===C.D. Guadalajara===
Hernández began playing with Chivas' lower division team, [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara Reserves|Chivas Coras]] in [[Tepic, Nayarit]] in the 2005–06 season.

With the score at 3–0, Hernández came on as a substitute for [[Omar Bravo]] in the 82nd minute, before scoring the fourth goal of the game five minutes later. It was his only goal in seven appearances in 2006–07. He made a further six appearances in 2007–08 without scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Worrall |first=Frank |title=Chicharito – The Biography of Javier Hernandez |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWIW21vQzesC&amp;pg=PT11 |year=2012 |publisher=John Blake Publishing |isbn=978-1-78219-079-0 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
====Transfer====
[[File:Chicharito.ogv|thumb|Hernández on his Manchester United debut]]
[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were first made aware of Hernández in October 2009; a scout went to Mexico that December and reported positively after watching a few games. Because of Hernández's age, the club originally planned to wait before making a move to sign him, but his potential involvement with the national team at the World Cup rushed the club into making a bid. United's chief scout, Jim Lawlor, was sent to Mexico for three weeks in February and March to watch Hernández and filed another positive report on him, before the club solicitor went over to Mexico to finalise the paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Boss: We had to move fast |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Boss-We-had-to-move-fast.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2010, Hernández agreed a deal to sign for Manchester United for an undisclosed fee, subject to a work permit application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Communications Dept. |title=Reds agree Hernandez deal |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Reds-agree-Hernandez-deal.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous day, Hernández had been present at Manchester United's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-final win over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Chicharito's 'dream' move |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Apr/Chicharitos-dream-move.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was conducted in complete secrecy; Hernández's agent was kept in the dark, as was his grandfather [[Tomás Balcázar]], who thought Hernández was going on a trip to [[Atlanta]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Duncan |last=White |title=Javier Hernandez, aka El Chicharito, living the Manchester United dream |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/7578217/Javier-Hernandez-aka-El-Chicharito-living-the-Manchester-United-dream.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Tom |last1=Marshall |first2=Steve |last2=Bartram |title=United's covert operation |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/Jun/Uniteds-covert-operation.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal, United played a friendly against Chivas to open the Mexican club's [[Estadio Chivas|new stadium]] on 30 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Marshall |title=Manchester United to play Chivas at new stadium |url=http://guadalajarareporter.com/sports-mainmenu-89/26618-manchester-united-set-guadalajara-date.html |website=Guadalajara Reporter |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711132837/http://guadalajarareporter.com/sports-mainmenu-89/26618-manchester-united-set-guadalajara-date.html |archivedate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, the work permit was granted, allowing the transfer to be made official on 1 July.&lt;ref name="mu"&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Tuck |title=Chicharito granted work permit |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2010/May/Chicharito-granted-permit.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernández made his United debut on 28 July, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for [[Nani]] in the [[2010 MLS All-Star Game]] at the [[NRG Stadium]], Houston; he scored his first goal for the club 18 minutes later, lobbing the ball over [[Nick Rimando]] from just outside the area after a long through-ball from [[Darren Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=MLS All-Stars 2 United 5 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2010/Jul/MLS-AllStars-2-United-5.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Hernández scored against Manchester United while playing in a friendly for his old club, Chivas; he started the game in a Chivas jersey and scored after just eight minutes.

Hernández made his competitive debut on 8 August and scored his first goal in the process, netting United's second of a 3–1 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2010 FA Community Shield]].

====Real Madrid (loan)====
On 1 September 2014, Hernández signed for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] on a season-long loan deal, with an option of a purchase at the end of the loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 September 2014 |title=Real Madrid sign Javier Hernández on loan from Manchester United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/01/javier-hernandez-real-madrid-manchester-united-loan |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent a medical and signed the contract that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicharito Hernández signs his contract with Real Madrid |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/en/news/2014/09/chicharito-hernandez-signs-his-contract-with-real-madrid |publisher=Real Madrid C.F. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut in the [[Madrid derby]] on 13 September, replacing [[Karim Benzema]] for the final 27 minutes as the team lost 2–1 at home to [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid 1–2 Atl Madrid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29176277 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, Hernández came on as a 77th-minute substitute for [[Gareth Bale]] and scored his first two goals in an 8–2 away win against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29275785 |title=Deportivo de La Coruña 2–8 Real Madrid |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent exit from Manchester United====
On 29 August 2015, it was reported that Manchester United manager [[Louis Van Gaal]] had told Hernández he could leave the club before the closure of the transfer window. Although with one year of his contract still remaining, it was unclear with scale of transfer fee United would demand for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Jason |title=Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal tells Javier Hernandez he is free to leave |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11832741/Manchester-United-manager-Louis-van-Gaal-tells-Javier-Hernandez-he-is-free-to-leave.html |accessdate=18 September 2018 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A clinical goalscorer, Hernández has been described as a "goal-poacher", due to a number of his goals being scored from close-range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Javier Hernández and the best tap-in merchants |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8385881/Javier-Hernandez-and-the-best-ever-tap-in-merchants.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf9"&gt;{{cite web |title=The False 9: Javier Hernandez – Rebirth of the Poacher? |url=http://www.thefalse9.com/2011/06/javier-hernandez-modern-day-poacher-in.html |website=The False 9 |access-date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His movement off the ball, pace, and ability to find space inside the box has also been praised.&lt;ref name="tf9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |date=16 March 2011 |title=Sir Alex Ferguson hails form of Javier Hernández for Manchester United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/16/alex-ferguson-javier-hernandez-manchester-united |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as one of the few players who seem capable of appearing behind a defender's back to knock in the ball from two yards, with his playing style being compared to that of German striker [[Miroslav Klose]].&lt;ref name="Christenson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Christenson |first=Marcus |title=Javier Hernández and the underrated art of the clinical goalscorer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/02/javier-hernandez-goalscorer-bayer-leverkusen-tottenham-champions-league-miroslav-klose |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudi Völler]], sporting director of Bayer Leverkusen, has praised Hernández for his keen positioning in front of goal, saying: "he certainly doesn't win every tackle but he has an incredible sense of where the ball will end up".&lt;ref name="Christenson" /&gt; Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] described Hernández as two-footed, very quick, in possession of a good spring, and a natural goalscorer. Ferguson also said Hernández's style reminds him of former United striker [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] – the so-called "baby-faced assassin" who scored the injury time winner against Bayern Munich in United's 1999 Champions League triumph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/premier-league/javier-hernandez-bliver-den-nye-solskjaer Javier Hernandez bliver den nye Solskjær] {{dk icon}} Tipsbladet, 1 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández's former teammate [[Jesús Padilla]] described him as "amazing in the air" despite his height.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;
Due to his small stature, he is extremely quick and agile, also possessing good technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/2590455/javier-hernandez-signs-for-bayer-leverkusen-from-man-united |title=Javier Hernandez signs for Bayer Leverkusen from Manchester United |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Richard Jolly |date=31 August 2015|access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2016 interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hernández commented on his abilities inside the penalty area, describing the intuition he has in knowing where an impending cross will fall from a teammate and outsmarting opposing defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the churning mind of Mexico's Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/05/31/chicharito-mexico-javier-hernandez-bayer-leverkusen |website=Sports Illustrated |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Mexico national team coach [[Juan Carlos Osorio]] described Hernández as having "a knack for the goal. Sometimes it seems like every rebound or every deflection goes into his path. Another thing is he doesn't dwell on a missed opportunity. He always looks forward to the next one. He has good ability in the air. He has good pace, and he makes those diagonal runs starting from the first defender in behind the second one. He also has the willingness to work defensively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Masters of Modern Soccer: Chicharito and the Art of Mexico's Synchronization |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/05/03/chicharito-javier-hernandez-mexico-juan-carlos-osorio-masters-modern-soccer |website=Sports Illustrated |first=Grant |last=Wahl |date=3 May 2018 |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
