'''Simon Luc Hildebert Mignolet''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈsimɔn ˈmiɲɔˌlɛː}}, {{IPA-fr|simɔ̃ miɲɔlɛ|lang}}; born 6 March 1988) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

Mignolet started his career with [[Belgian Second Division]] side [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]] in 2004, and spent six years with the club, making 100 senior league appearances and scoring a goal. He moved to Premier League side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/8746398.stm|title=Sunderland sign keeper Mignolet|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for £2&amp;nbsp;million, spending three years with them and making 101 appearances across all competitions before moving to Liverpool in June 2013 for £9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/8792847/transfer-news-liverpool-sign-goalkeeper-simon-mignolet-from-sunderland|title=Transfer news: Liverpool sign goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from Sunderland|last=Parrish|first=Rob|date=26 June 2013|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mignolet has represented the Belgium national team at every level from under-16 upwards. He made his senior debut in 2011, has since earned over 20 caps. He was also named to Belgium's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Sint-Truiden===
Mignolet was born in [[Sint-Truiden]]. He first joined his local football team, [[Belgian Second Division]] side [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]], in 2004, eventually rising through their youth system to become their first-choice goalkeeper in 2006 at age 18 after the departure of [[Dušan Belić]]. In 2009, he made 29 appearances and scored a penalty in the league, as he helped Sint-Truiden to win the [[Belgian Second Division]], and was named [[Belgian professional football awards|Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year]] the following year after he helped Sint-Truiden avoid relegation.

===Sunderland===
[[File:Simon Mignolet.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Simon Mignolet with Sunderland in 2011]]
After being invited for a training ground tour, Mignolet signed a five-year contract with English [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 17 June 2010 in a deal worth £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/17/sunderland-sign-simon-mignolet|title=Sunderland sign Belgium Under-21 goalkeeper Simon Mignolet|date=17 June 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619141456/http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |title=Mignolet on dream move |publisher=Sunderland A.F.C |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |archivedate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed by Sint-Truiden that Sunderland had beaten [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Twente|Twente]] and [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] to secure Mignolet's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2010/03/29/1854728/there-has-been-no-contact-between-psv-and-simon-mignolet|title=FINISHED: No Contact Yet Between PSV And Simon Mignolet|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mignolet made his Sunderland debut in a 2–2 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 15 August 2010, and was named man of the match for his performance. In the next home match, a 1–0 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Mignolet kept his first clean sheet for Sunderland, following an excellent reaction save to deny [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] a goal. Mignolet put in another fine performance against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as Sunderland drew 1–1 after [[Darren Bent]] equalised in the 95th minute. However, [[Craig Gordon]] would replace Mignolet in goal several weeks later, and remained first-choice thereafter. Mignolet did not feature again until 8 January 2011, when Sunderland suffered a loss at home to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]]. Mignolet would become first-choice goalkeeper again after a knee injury to Gordon in February, and earned a string of rave reviews for his performances.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Following the draw, Sunderland manager [[Steve Bruce]] hailed the young goalkeeper's fine start to life in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/03/05/2380907/sunderland-boss-steve-bruce-hails-performance-of-goalkeeper|title=Sunderland boss Steve Bruce hails performance of goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after draw with Arsenal - Goal.com|date=5 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mignolet cemented his position as first-choice goalkeeper the following season, being preferred to new signing [[Keiren Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8695430/Liverpool-1-Sunderland-1-match-report.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rory | last=Smith | title=Liverpool 1 Sunderland 1: match report | date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2011, Mignolet was injured during a 2–2 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], suffering a broken nose following a collision with [[Emile Heskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/7281455/Mignolet-suffers-broken-nose |title=Mignolet suffers broken nose |publisher=Sky Sports |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mignolet played every single match of [[2011–12 Sunderland A.F.C. season|the following season]], keeping a large number of clean sheets and producing several man of the match performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayner |first=Stuart |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/safc/safc-news/2012/09/24/simon-mignolet-just-fails-to-save-the-day-61634-31893069/ |title=Simon Mignolet just fails to save the day – Sunderland News – SAFC |publisher=JournalLive |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holden |first=Kit |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/match-report-sunderlands-simon-mignolet-at-his-best-to-keep-stoke-city-at-bay-8229208.html |title=Match Report: Sunderland's Simon Mignolet at his best to keep Stoke City at bay – Premier League – Football |publisher=The Independent |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form prompted Manchester City and [[England national football team|England]] goalkeeper [[Joe Hart]] to praise Mignolet in December 2012 as being the best goalkeeper in the league so far that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Young |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2264744/Simon-Mignolet-interview-On-pressure-injury-degree.html |title=Simon Mignolet interview: On pressure, his injury and his degree &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June 2013, it was reported [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] had agreed a deal to sign the player for around £9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23011973 |title=BBC Sport – Simon Mignolet: Liverpool sign Sunderland keeper for £9m |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
[[File:Simon Mignolet - Gerrard testimonial 2013.jpg|175px|thumb|Mignolet with Liverpool in 2013 during [[Steven Gerrard]]'s testimonial match]]
On 25 June 2013, Mignolet signed with Liverpool for a reported fee of £9&amp;nbsp;million on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23011973 |title=Simon Mignolet: Liverpool sign Sunderland keeper for £9m |publisher=BBC Sport |date= 25 June 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] hailed Mignolet as being "one of the top goalkeepers in the Premier League".{{cn|date=February 2019}} On 13 July 2013, he made his unofficial debut for Liverpool in a 4–0 win in a pre-season friendly over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/139323-reds-hit-preston-for-four-report |title=Reds hit Preston for four – report |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |first=Alex |last=Urquhart-Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August 2013, Mignolet made his official debut in the 1–0 home win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at [[Anfield]]. In the 89th minute of the match, he saved a [[Jonathan Walters]] penalty, as well as [[Kenwyne Jones]]' follow-up shot, to preserve Liverpool's lead and effectively win the match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23653990 "Liverpool 1–0 Stoke"] BBC Sport. 17 August 2013. Retrieved 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He then recorded two more clean sheets against Aston Villa and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with both matches ending 1–0 in favour of Liverpool. Two weeks later, he conceded his first goals for Liverpool in the Premier League in a 2–2 draw with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], though he was still named man of the match for the fixture. Mignolet was also named man of the match in the 3–3 draw with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], making nine saves throughout the match.{{cn|date=February 2019}}

[[File:Simon Mignolet, 2014.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mignolet playing for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2014]]
On 14 December 2014, Mignolet's run of 53 consecutive Premier League starts came to an end as he was replaced by [[Brad Jones (footballer)|Brad Jones]] in the starting 11 against Manchester United, with Brendan Rodgers saying Mignolet would be dropped for an "indefinite period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester United 3 Liverpool 0, match report: David de Gea the Old Trafford hero as rivals are swept aside|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/11293000/Manchester-United-3-Liverpool-0-match-report-David-de-Gea-the-Old-Trafford-hero-as-rivals-are-swept-aside.html|accessdate=14 December 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 12 days later, Jones went off injured after 16 minutes away at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and despite some errors, Mignolet kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Neil|title=Burnley 0–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544290|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this match, Mignolet kept four consecutive clean sheets against Sunderland, Aston Villa, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and Everton respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30257075|title=Sunderland 0–1 Liverpool|date=10 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30758464|title=Aston Villa 0–2 Liverpool|date=17 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30963476|title=Liverpool 2–0 West Ham|date=31 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31071270|title=Everton 0–0 Liverpool|date=7 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Football|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, Mignolet made some outstanding saves against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 3–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31106342|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March, Mignolet continued his resurgence in a 1–0 victory against Swansea, keeping a clean sheet as part of a strong performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31792005|title=Swansea City 0–1 Liverpool|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March, he saved a penalty taken by [[Wayne Rooney]] in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 1–2 Manchester United|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31893202|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2016, Mignolet signed new five-year deal with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Mignolet: Liverpool goalkeeper signs new five-year deal|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35347250|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, he saved a penalty from [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]'s [[Peter Crouch]] and [[Marc Muniesa]] in a penalty shoot-out to send Liverpool to the [[2016 Football League Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/26/liverpool-stoke-city-capital-one-cup-match-report|title=Joe Allen fires Liverpool to Wembley in shootout win over Stoke City|date=26 January 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he started the first five matches of the season, Liverpool manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] dropped Mignolet in favor of new signing [[Loris Karius]] on 24 September 2016 for the match against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37393500 |title=Liverpool 5–1 Hull City |date=24 September 2016 |publisher=BBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2016, Klopp confirmed Mignolet was no longer Liverpool's first-choice goalkeeper and that he will be given cup matches instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/liverpool-news-jurgen-klopp-simon-mignolet-efl-cup-vs-spurs-a7378771.html |title=Liverpool news: Jurgen Klopp confirms Simon Mignolet is no longer No 1 as Liverpool prepare for EFL Cup clash |date=24 October 2016 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mignolet returned to the starting lineup for the team in Premier League in December 2016.

Mignolet played in two further friendly internationals during the [[2011–12 in Belgian football|2011–12]] season, starting against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/match?id=337296&amp;cc=5739 |title=Match: Greece v Belgium |publisher=ESPN |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18294160 |title=England 1–0 Belgium |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the match against England, he did not play an international match for four months, with [[Thibaut Courtois]] being preferred instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benefoot.net/belgium-netherlands-team-news-courtois-starts-in-goal-for-the-rode-duivels/ |title=Belgium – Netherlands Team News: Courtois starts in goal for the Rode Duivels |publisher=BeNeFoot |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |first=Gary |last=Niblock}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the starting lineup on 14 November 2012 in a 1–2 friendly loss over [[Romania national football team|Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.belgianfootball.be/project/publiek/rencinter/en/wed_7692.htm |title=Romania 2–1 Belgium |publisher=Royal Belgian Football Association |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next international match came over six months later in a 4–2 friendly victory over the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on 29 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.belgianfootball.be/project/publiek/rencinter/en/wed_7805.htm |title=USA 2–4 Belgium |publisher=Royal Belgian Football Association |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mignolet served as back-up goalkeeper during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign]], with Courtois playing every minute as Belgium qualified for its first major tournament since the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/9029958/chelsea-keeper-thibaut-courtois-labelled-best-in-world-by-belgium-team-mate-toby-alderweireld|title=Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois labelled 'best in world' by Belgium team-mate Toby Alderweireld|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=17 April 2014|work=BSkyB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2015, Mignolet started for an injured Courtois in Belgium's last two [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifying]] matches: a 4–1 win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and a 3–1 victory over [[Israel national football team|Israel]], helping seal Belgium's qualification for the first time since co-hosting [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium claim Euro 2016 spot by trashing Andorra 4–1|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/10/uk-soccer-euro-andorra-idUKKCN0S40WT20151010|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Reuters|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Belgium’s preliminary [[Belgium national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: Belgium announce initial 28-man squad for Russia| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/belgium-world-cup-squad-confirmed-russia-2018-nainggolan-hazard-de-bruyne-lukaku-a8361241.html%3Famp |accessdate= 9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later appeared on their 24-man squad as a goalkeeper together with [[Thibaut Courtois]] and [[Koen Casteels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/0/belgium-world-cup-2018-squad-list-team-guide/ |title=Belgium World Cup 2018 squad list and team guide |last=Fifield |first=Andrew |date=15 July 2018 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
