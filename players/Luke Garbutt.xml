'''Luke Samuel Garbutt''' (born 21 May 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Harrogate]], [[North Yorkshire]],&lt;ref name=Hugman/&gt; Garbutt attended [[Harrogate Grammar School]] where he played in the Year 7 School Football team that reached the Harrogate and District Cup Final in 2005. His impressive performances for his junior club team, Pannal Ash Juniors, saw him signed by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] where he began his professional career. Shortly after leaving school, he was signed from their academy by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009, for an initial fee of £600,000 which was set by a tribunal as the two clubs could not agree a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton reveal Luke Garbutt compensation fee|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/6154979/Everton-reveal-Luke-Garbutt-compensation-fee.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=8 September 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was loaned to [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] during the 2011–12 season.

In the [[2012–13 Everton F.C. season|2012–13 season]] Garbutt made his Everton debut, coming on at half-time during a 5–0 [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] second-round win over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on 29 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2194845/Everton-v-Leyton-Orient-live.html | title=Capital One Cup Live: Everton 5 Leyton Orient 0 – as it happened from Goodison Park |newspaper=Daily Mail | accessdate=29 August 2012 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Ripley | date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Garbutt signed a new two-year contract with Everton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton left-back Luke Garbutt signs new two-year contract|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8803812/Everton-left-back-Luke-Garbutt-signs-new-two-year-contract|publisher=Sky Sports|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the season went to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on loan.

Garbutt made his Premier League debut as a late substitute at Southampton in April 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garbutt Pleased With Progress|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2014/05/26/garbutt-pleased-with-progress|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=26 May 2014 |archivedate=28 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528032838/http://www.evertonfc.com:80/news/archive/2014/05/26/garbutt-pleased-with-progress |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built on that with his first appearance for England's Under-21s in a 3–1 European Championship qualifying win over Wales the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wales U21 v England U21|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/307941/teams|publisher=Sky Sports|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
