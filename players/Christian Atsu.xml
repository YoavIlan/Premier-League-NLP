After spending the 2016–17 season on loan at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], he completed a permanent transfer to the club in May 2017.

A full international with over 30 caps since his debut in 2012, Atsu has represented Ghana at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and two [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments.
