Kovačić is usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]], but he is considered to be a versatile midfielder, having played in different positions and adapted to playing either [[Midfielder#Winger|wide]] on the left or as an [[midfielder|attacking midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is Inter new boy Mateo Kovacic? |url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/02/who-is-inter-new-boy-mateo-kovacic/ |publisher=Forza Italian Football |date=3 February 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovačić began his professional career with [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the age of 16, with whom he won two consecutive league titles, before joining [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in 2013. After the [[2014–15 Inter Milan season|2014–15 season]], he moved to Real Madrid, where he has won the Champions League on three occasions. A full Croatian international since 2013, Kovačić represented the nation at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], including a runner's up finish in the latter tournament. He is nicknamed ''Il Professore (The Professor).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mateo Kovacic: Scout Report Inter’s creative midfield talent |url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2014/01/23/mateo-kovacic-scout-report/ |publisher=Outside of the Boot |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovavic il migliore con la Croazia, soprannominato dai compagni "il Professore" |url=http://www.diggita.it/story.php?title=Kovavic_il_migliore_con_la_Croazia_soprannominato_dai_compagni_il_Professore-1 |publisher=diggita.it |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Youth career===
Born in [[Linz]], Austria, to [[Bosnian Croat]] parents who had moved there from [[Kotor Varoš]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kovačić began playing at an early age at the local [[LASK Linz]]'s academy.&lt;ref name="zidak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic-kao-maradona--modric--pele---/905740/ |title=Meteor Kovačić: Svi su ludi za dječakom koji je već sa 13 igrao zrelo kao nekad Maradona |last=Židak |first=Tomislav |work=[[Jutarnji list]] |date=22 November 2010 |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, when Kovačić was 13, he was spotted by scouts from several prominent European clubs, including [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Inter Milan]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], but his family opted to move to [[Zagreb]] instead, where he joined the [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb Academy|academy]] of Croatian giants [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="zidak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic--kako-je-stvoren-igrac-od-100-milijuna-kuna/1082758/ |title=Cijela istina o Mateu Kovačiću |last=Cigoj |first=Mark |work=Jutarnji list |date=2 February 2013 |language=Croatian |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kovačić suffered a serious injury in 2009 in which his leg was broken, but he returned to the pitch after a lengthy recovery on 31 May 2010, appearing in the last match of the [[Prva HNL Academy|Croatian under-17 academy league]], a 5–0 win against [[RNK Split]] under-17s.&lt;ref name="kadeti"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/398143/nogomet-1-hnl/kadeti-dinama-za-naslov-prestigli-hajduk |title=Kadeti Dinama za naslov prestigli Hajduk |last=Rupnik |first=Borna |date=31 May 2010 |publisher=[[Sportnet.hr|Sportnet]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dinamo Zagreb===
Kovačić started training with the club's senior squad under manager, [[Vahid Halilhodžić]], four months later, on 6 October 2010,&lt;ref name="vahid"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/mateo-kovacic-od-danas-trenira-sa-seniorima-dinama--plasi-me-nadimak-hrvatski-messi/892846/ |title=Mateo Kovačić od danas trenira sa seniorima Dinama: Plaši me nadimak Hrvatski Messi |date=6 October 2010 |newspaper=[[Sportske novosti]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to appear for the club in academy league matches during October. Later that month, it was reported by the local sports daily, ''[[Sportske novosti]]'', that [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s chief scout, Steve Rowley, had arrived in Zagreb to watch him perform in under-17 matches against [[HNK Cibalia|Cibalia]] and [[NK Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="sportske"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/arsenal-dosao-po-matea-kovacica--dinamo-nasao-novo-cudo-od-djeteta---miralema-ramica/899213/ |title=Arsenal došao po Matea Kovačića, Dinamo našao novo čudo od djeteta&amp;nbsp;— Miralema Ramića |date=29 October 2010 |newspaper=Sportske novosti |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kovačić eventually had his professional league debut in the [[2010–11 Prva HNL]] away match against [[NK Hrvatski dragovoljac|Hrvatski Dragovoljac]] on 20 November 2010, in which he scored Dinamo's fourth goal in their 6–0 win.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/407740/nogomet-1-hnl/i-kovacic-strijelac-u-dinamovoj-sestici |title=I Kovačić strijelac u Dinamovoj šestici |last=Rupnik |first=Borna |date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Sportnet |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him the youngest goalscorer in the history of the league, at the age of 16 years and 198 days, breaking the record set only a week earlier by [[Dino Špehar]] who had scored for [[NK Osijek]] at the age of 16 years and 278 days on 13 November 2010.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/TcomPrvaHNL/97374/Mateo-Kovacic-najmladi-je-strijelac-Prve-HNL.html |title=Mateo Kovačić najmlađi je strijelac Prve HNL |date=20 November 2010 |publisher=TPortal |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spehar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/407385/nogomet-1-hnl/spehar-spasio-bijelo-plave |title=Špehar spasio bijelo-plave |last=Plavčić |first=Mario |date=13 November 2010 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first senior season with Dinamo Zagreb he managed to appear in 7 matches, making a contribution in winning the league title.

In the [[2011–12 Prva HNL|2011–12]] season, Kovačić rapidly established himself as a first team regular. He played mainly in the position of left midfielder in 4–2–3–1 system. In the beginning of the season, he helped the team reach the Group Stage of the season's [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time in 12 years. Being only 17 years old, he appeared in the starting lineup of Dinamo's first group match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. He finished his first European season with Dinamo by scoring a goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in the last game of the Group Stage in [[Zagreb]] and thus became the second youngest ever scorer in the Champions League. In the domestic league, he was a regular starter, appearing in 25 league matches and scoring five goals in the process. During a league match against [[NK Lučko]], he became the youngest player to wear the captain's armband in Dinamo's history, taking the captaincy from [[Leandro Cufre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kvačić najmlađi kapetan u Dnamovoj povijesti |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/prvaliga/145385/Kovacic-najmladi-kapetan-Dinama-u-povijesti.html#.UQm78x32_Wo |date=27 August 2011 |work=Tportal.hr |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was another successful season for him in domestic competitions as he appeared in 32 domestic league and cup matches during that season, helping Dinamo to win their seventh consecutive league title. He also scored in the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] final against [[NK Osijek]] on [[Maksimir Stadium]]. In December 2011, he was named [[Croatian Footballer of the Year#Hope of the Year|Croatian Football Hope of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovačiću trofej Nada godine: Liga prvaka je bila uživancija |url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacicu-trofej-nada-godine-liga-prvaka-je-bila-uzivancija-248104 |newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]] |date=31 December 2011 |language=Croatian |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of [[2012–13 Prva HNL|2012–13]] season, he suffered a metatarsal bone injury that caused him to miss several games on the club's qualifying road to another Champions League. He returned just in time to play in Dinamo's first Champions League game against [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Kovačić played in all six Dinamo Zagreb's matches in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage]], against Porto, [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. He continued to impress with his mature performances at a young age during the first half of the season. In October 2012, he was nominated for [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy]], an award given by sports journalists to a young player from Europe perceived to have been the most impressive during a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kovačić kandidat za prestižnu nagradu "Golden Boy 2012." |url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacic-kandidat-za-prestiznu-nagradu-golden-boy-2012-287471 |newspaper=24sata |date=20 October 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season's winter break, Dinamo's board threw away the speculations about Kovačić leaving the club in the near future by saying they are building a new team around him and another rising star, [[Alen Halilović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovačića i Halilovića nećemo prodati! |url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/dinamo-sporting-nam-se-nije-javio-kovacica-i-halilovica-necemo-prodati/652404.aspx |publisher=index.hr |date=15 December 2012 |language=Croatian |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 30 January 2013, the media surprisingly revealed Kovačić was sold to Italian [[Serie A]] club Inter Milan.

During his time with Dinamo, Kovačić won two domestic league titles and two Croatian Cup titles, appearing in a total of 73 official matches, including 12 appearances in the UEFA Champions League.

===Inter Milan===
[[File:Mateo Kovacic.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Kovačić with Inter in February 2013.]]
On 31 January 2013, Kovačić agreed to a transfer to Inter Milan. It was revealed the deal was worth €15&amp;nbsp;million in total, with €11&amp;nbsp;million paid immediately and €4&amp;nbsp;million when and if Inter qualifies for the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name="Maglia 10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter, Kovacic da 10, Maglia e calcio senza paura |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/02-02-2013/inter-kovacic-10-video-maglia-calcio-senza-paura-914107775713.shtml |first=Luca |last=Taidelli |newspaper=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]] |date=2 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, Kovačić was given the number 10 shirt, previously worn by [[Wesley Sneijder]].&lt;ref name="Maglia 10"/&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Kovačić made his Inter Milan debut three days later on 3 February, coming on as a half-time substitute in a [[2012–13 Serie A|Serie A]] match against [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Siena-Inter 3-1, Stramaccioni affonda sotto i gol di Sestu e Emeghara |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Siena/03-02-2013/siena-inter-3-1-male-nerazzurri-sestu-emeghara-dominano--914124870634.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=3 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, Kovačić made his European debut before the home crowd at [[San Siro]] in [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] match against [[CFR Cluj]]. He provided the winning assist for [[Rodrigo Palacio]], who made it 2–0 for Inter, impressing the crowd with his performance, and was given standing ovations while being substituted off in the 89th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter-Cluj 2-0: Doppio Palacio, ottimo Kovacic, ma infortunio per Milito |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/14-02-2013/inter-cluj-2-0-doppio-palacio-ottimo-kovacic-ma-infortunio-milito-923391317.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=15 February 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played full 90 minutes in the 3–0 away win against CFR Cluj as Inter proceeded to the next round of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europa League, Cluj-Inter 0-3: doppietta di Guarin, poi Benassi.

Kovačić made his first domestic league start for Inter in the next round of Serie A in a 1–4 away loss against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. In the round of 16 of the UEFA Europa League, Inter was drawn to play against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. After a 3–0 loss in London, Inter needed a 4–0 win in [[Milan]] to proceed to the next round. The match ended in a 4–1 win for Inter after the match went into extra time, with Kovačić playing as a starter. He impressed with his composure and playmaking ability, once again receiving ovations by the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter-Tottenham 4-1, Cassano da applausi, ma non basta: Spurs ai quarti |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/14-03-2013/europa-league-inter-tottenham-92474067493.shtml |first=Valerio |last=Clari |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=14 March 2013 |language=Italian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Inter manager [[Andrea Stramaccioni]] hailed his performances on several occasions, describing him as a "star for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inter Milan coach Andrea Stramaccioni hails Mateo Kovacic |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/news/stramaccioni-hails-kovacic_74900.html |last=Mondal |first=Subhankar |date=18 March 2013 |publisher=Sportsmole.co.uk |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, Kovačić was a starter in his first ''[[Derby d'Italia]]'' against Juventus at San Siro.

[[File:Mateo Kovačić 2015.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kovačić playing for Real Madrid in a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk in 2015.]]
On 16 August 2015, Inter manager [[Roberto Mancini]] confirmed the club was forced to sell Kovačić to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] due to [[UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations|Financial Fair Play]] regulations. Speaking during a press conference after a friendly against Greek club [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], Mancini said, "There are rules that have to be respected.

[[File:Cristiano Ronaldo entrenando.jpg|thumb|left|Kovačić (left) warming up with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Casemiro]] during the 2015–16 season]]

In the opening months of the season, he was used quite regularly by then Real Madrid manager [[Rafael Benítez]], playing in almost every midfield position there is&amp;nbsp;– sometimes central, sometimes wide, sometimes further forward. However, after [[Zinedine Zidane]] replaced Benítez in early January, Kovačić's appearances became increasingly infrequent. With the Frenchman preferring to use a very defined starting 11 whenever possible instead of the more specific-lineups-for-specific-opponents approach employed by his predecessor, there was little room for Kovačić. He made eight appearances and scored one goal en Real Madrid's route to the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000638/match=2015789/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Spot-on Real Madrid defeat Atlético in final again |date=28 May 2016 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started off as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] at Dinamo Zagreb, but he transformed his game at Inter where he was deployed out wide and also as a central midfielder, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker, while being coached by Andrea Stramaccioni.&lt;ref name="Mehrotra"/&gt; One of his trademarks is dropping deep to receive the ball and then driving forward, often performing his slalom runs.&lt;ref name="Mehrotra"/&gt; Under the coach, Walter Mazzarri, he was often used in a more advanced position. Former manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] once claimed that Kovačić knows how to really reach the ball from deep and drive up the pitch like a 'raging bull'.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite web |last=Higgins |first=Timm |title=Could Mateo Kovacic Be The Heir To Luka Modric’s Crown? |url=http://www.managingmadrid.com/2017/2/10/14557684/could-mateo-kovacic-be-the-heir-to-luka-modrics-crown |work=Managing Madrid |accessdate=12 February 2017 |date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proven by his pass completion percentages, Kovačić is known for distributing the ball up the pitch.&lt;ref name=MM /&gt;

;Reception
The Croatia under-17 manager, [[Martin Novoselac]], reportedly said of Kovačić, "I haven't seen a youngster with so much talent since the days of Robert Prosinečki," referring to his fast development and talent.&lt;ref name="zidak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vahid"/&gt; Kovačić revealed that precisely Prosinečki is the player he admired the most while growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kovačić otkrio Talijanima koga je 'snimao' |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/nogomet/242330/Kovacic-otkrio-Talijanima-koga-je-volio-gledati.html |publisher=Tportal.hr |date=8 February 2013 |language=Croatian |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His compatriot, [[Zvonimir Boban]], who played for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] for over a decade, in an interview with [[Sky Italia]] (in 2013) said, "He has talents that could make him even better than me, he is an incredibly serious professional for someone his age. Kovačić is a complete player. He is not a born regista but he is playing there now. He is a complete talent that can still grow&amp;nbsp;— he has incredible potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inter snap up Kovacic and Kuzmanovic |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1320857/inter-snap-kovacic-kuzmanovic?cc=5739 |date=31 January 2013 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trapattoni described him as "a mixture of [[Kaká]] and [[Clarence Seedorf]]", because of his style of play and technical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Kovacic is a mix of Kaka and Seedorf' - Trapattoni |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2013/11/24/4428536/kovacic-is-a-mix-of-kaka-and-seedorf-trapattoni |date=24 November 2013 |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-time Inter captain [[Javier Zanetti]] stated that, with the exception of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who had arrived to Inter when he was 21, Kovačić was the most promising youngster he had seen in his 19 years at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Face to face: Javier Zanetti |url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/face-to-face-javier-zanetti |first=Jamie |last=Rainbow |date=12 August 2013 |publisher=WorldSoccer |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
