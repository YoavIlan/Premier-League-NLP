'''Anders Rozenkrantz Lindegaard''' ({{IPA-da|ɑnɐs ˈlenəɡɒːˀ|lang}}; born 13 April 1984) is a Danish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He began his career with his hometown club, [[Odense Boldklub]], but a lack of first-team opportunities led to a move to Norwegian club [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]] in 2009, with whom he won the [[Norwegian Football Cup]]. After winning the Goalkeeper of the Year award in both Denmark and Norway in 2010, Lindegaard was signed by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he played for five years as a back-up to [[Edwin van der Sar]] and [[David de Gea]]. He moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 2015, but was unable to break into the team and joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in January 2016, initially on loan. He joined Burnley in September 2017.

Lindegaard represented Denmark at [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] level before making his [[Denmark national football team|senior]] debut on 7 September 2010 against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. He went on to win 5 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for his country.

====2010–11 season====
[[File:Anders Lindegaard.jpg|200px|thumb|Lindegaard warming up for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] before a game in 2011]]
Since early November 2010, he was reported to have become a target for English club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Former United goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]], however, opined that Lindegaard was not yet ready for regular [[Premier League]] action.&lt;ref name="dm" /&gt; On 23 November 2010, it was reported that Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] expected to complete the signing of the player in the "next two or three weeks".&lt;ref name="MUCOSA"&gt;{{ cite news | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9221649.stm | title = Man Utd close to Anders Lindegaard signing | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 23 November 2010 | accessdate = 24 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125062551/https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9221649.stm| archivedate= 25 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 2010, Lindegaard joined Manchester United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee believed to be around [[Pound sterling|£]]3.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="dm2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd complete Anders Lindegaard signing |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9221649.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 November 2010 |accessdate=27 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125062551/https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9221649.stm| archivedate= 25 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained with the first team throughout December, but he was unable to play for his new club until the [[transfer window]] re-opened on 1 January 2011. Lindegaard was officially registered with the Premier League on 6 January, and assigned the number 34 jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=Lindegaard gets no.34 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Jan/Lindegaard-gets-34-shirt.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Lindegaard made his Manchester United debut in a 2–1 victory against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the [[FA Cup]] [[2010–11 FA Cup#Fourth Round Proper|Fourth Round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/31/anders-lindegaard-manchester-united-no1 |title=Anders Lindegaard does not want Manchester United's No1 shirt |date=31 January 2011 |work=Guardian |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Old Trafford]] home debut on 19 February in another FA Cup match, this time against the [[Conference National]] side [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]], in which United won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1408729_anders_lindegaard_united_werent_good_enough_ |title=Anders Lindegaard: United weren't good enough |first=Stuart |last=Mathieson |date=21 February 2011 |work=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he underwent knee surgery that would keep him out of action for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Anders set for knee op |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Mar/Lindegaard-set-for-knee-op.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, Lindegaard played in the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] final for the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United Reserves]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.

====2011–12 season====
On 14 September, Lindegaard made his first [[UEFA Champions League]] start for United against Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. The match ended in a 1–1 draw with Lindegaard winning critical acclaim for his performance. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, still decided to continue with first-choice keeper [[David de Gea]] for the next match in the Premier League against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Asked about challenging for the first-team spot, Lindegaard said, "What answer do you expect to that question? I've said a thousand times before I'm not here to pick my nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ferguson-snaps-over-stupid-query-about-de-gea-omission-2354958.html |title=Ferguson snaps over 'stupid' query about De Gea omission |first=Ian |last=Herbert |date=15 September 2011 |work=Independent.co.uk |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, Lindegaard was handed his second Champions League start for United. He played against [[FC Oțelul Galați|Oțelul Galați]], with the match ending in a 2–0 win for United, earning them their first Champions League Group stage victory.

On 1 October 2011, Lindegaard made his Premier League debut for United against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in a 2–0 win at Old Trafford. He continued his run of clean sheets in his next four appearances in the Premier League, which included a 1–0 home win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 5 November, a 1–0 away win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 3 December, a 5–0 away win at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 21 December and a 5–0 home win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in United's Boxing day fixture. His run of clean sheets in the league finally ended on 4 January away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] when he was beaten three times in a game that United lost 3–0. A week later, on 8 January, Lindegaard played his biggest game for Manchester United so far, a 3–2 win against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the FA Cup. He was chosen again for the starting line-up the following week when United beat [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/nu-er-lindegaard-nummer-1 |title=Nu er Lindegaard nummer 1 |first=Michael |last=Qureshi |date=14 January 2012 |work=Sporten.dk |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2012, he damaged ankle ligaments in training, forcing him to miss the game against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the next day, along with the unwell first-choice David de Gea, meaning youngster [[Ben Amos]] played goal. Later in the week, Sir Alex Ferguson revealed Lindegaard would miss the next four-to-five weeks and would not be expected back until the home game with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

On 3 August 2012, Lindegaard signed a new four-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United's Anders Lindegaard signs new four-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19109604 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took the number 13 jersey made vacant by the departure of [[Park Ji-sung]], who had left the club for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Marshall |title=Reds reveal shirt numbers |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Aug/manchester-united-squad-numbers-for-2012-2013-season.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=17 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
Since the match against Norwich on 17 November 2012, first-choice goalkeeper David de Gea was sidelined with wisdom teeth problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=McDonnell |title=Hottest tin roof: Spanish cat De Gea says there's no pressure like United pressure |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-goalkeeper-david-de-1461004 |work=mirror.co.uk |publisher=Mirror Online |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindegaard was kept in goal for United's next five games until De Gea was recalled for the Champions League match against [[CFR Cluj]]. Lindegaard returned to the first team on 1 December 2012, against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in a match which ended 4–3. After the match, he came in for criticism by former United goalkeeper [[Alex Stepney]], who said that he lacks "authority at the back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Sir Alex Ferguson needs to figure out that two into one won't go |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/08/sir-alex-ferguson-manchester-united |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher=The Guardian Online |date=8 December 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period on the bench as an understudy to De Gea, and with United having already secured the Premier League title a month earlier, Lindegaard started in goal for Sir Alex Ferguson's final game as United manager against West Brom at [[The Hawthorns]]; the match finished 5–5. That appearance was Lindegaard's tenth of the season, thus qualifying him to receive a Premier League winner's medal.

====2013–14 season====
In [[2013–14 Manchester United F.C. season|2013–14]], Lindegaard made just three appearances for the Manchester United first team – against Norwich in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in the FA Cup and Newcastle in the Premier League– keeping clean sheets against Norwich and Newcastle.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 31 August 2015, Lindegaard joined West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lindegaard signs for Albion |url=http://www.wba.co.uk/news/article/wba-albion-lindegaard-manchester-united-2659187.aspx |website=wba.co.uk |publisher=West Bromwich Albion FC |date=30 August 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2016, Lindegaard signed a one-year permanent deal with Preston North End after the mutual termination of his West Brom contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anders Lindegaard Completes Permanent Move To Deepdale |url=http://www.pnefc.net/news/article/2016-17/anders-lindegaard-in-permanent-move-to-preston-north-end-3165250.aspx|publisher=Preston North End F.C. |date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lindegaard has represented Denmark at [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[Denmark national football team|senior]] level. He made his debut for the U-19s in September 2002, and played a [[2003 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]] qualification 1–0 win over [[Switzerland national under-19 football team|Switzerland]] on 13 October 2002.&lt;ref name="UEFA" /&gt; He played a total six youth international games until September 2003.

Lindegaard made his senior international debut in a [[UEFA Euro 2012]] qualifier against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 7 September 2010, which Denmark won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=830052&amp;sec=transfers&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;cc=4716 |title=Man Utd eye Lindegaard as Van der Sar successor |date=4 October 2010 |work=ESPN soccernet |accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season=2012/round=15171/match=2002304/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Last-gasp Kahlenberg crushes Iceland |first=Peter |last=Bruun |date=7 September 2010 |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October 2010, Denmark faced [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in another Euro 2012 qualifier. Early on in the game, with Denmark trailing 2–0, an injury sustained by starting goalkeeper [[Thomas Sørensen]] brought Lindegaard into action. He made many saves to keep his team in the game, but conceded a goal in the 85th minute to [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] with the match finishing 3–1 in Portugal's favour. Lindegaard started the following Euro 2012 qualifier against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], in which he kept a [[clean sheet]] as Denmark won 2–0. He was expected to feature for Denmark at the Euro 2012 finals but due to injuries while playing for his club and lack of proper game time post-recovery, his national teammate [[Stephan Andersen]] took over after normal second-choice goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen was injured in a pre-tournament friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

===LGBT activism===
Lindegaard is one of the few footballers to have spoken out against the intolerance of [[Homosexuality in association football|homosexuality in football]] and the absence of openly gay players from the professional game. In a 2012 blog entry, he wrote, {{quote|As a footballer I think first and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/football-needs-gay-hero-says-manchester-united-goalkeeper-575849.html|title=Football needs gay hero, says Manchester United goalkeeper|publisher=Breaking News|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
