'''André Horst Schürrle''' ({{IPA-de|ʔanˈdʁeː ˈʃʏɐ̯lə, ʔɑ̃ˈdʁeː -, ˈʔandʁeː -}}; born 6 November 1990) is a German professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], on loan from [[Borussia Dortmund]], and the [[Germany national football team|German national team]].

He began his career at [[FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] in 2009, spending two years at the club before a £6.5 million transfer to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. His performances there gained the attention of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who signed him for a reported £18 million in 2013. Schürrle played one-and-a-half [[Premier League]] seasons at the English club before joining [[VfL Wolfsburg]] for £22 million in January 2015, winning the [[DFB-Pokal]] and [[DFL-Supercup]] in his first year.

Schürrle has been a full international for Germany since 2010, gaining over 50 caps and scoring 20 goals. He was a member of the German squads which reached the semi-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. During extra-time in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] he provided the assist for [[Mario Götze]]'s winning goal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Schürrle started his career at local club Ludwigshafener SC at age four, before joining [[1. FSV Mainz 05]] in 2006. He played as a defender before switching to his current position of an attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teenage Kicks: Andre Schurrle |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/01/teenage-kicks--andre-schurrle.html |work=Chelseafc.com |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent three years playing for the club's youth teams, where he won the [[Under 19 Bundesliga]] in 2009 under coach [[Thomas Tuchel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thomas Tuchel's carnival club party on as Mainz maintain perfect start |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/sep/23/thomas-tuchel-mainz-bundesliga |work=The Guardian |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1. FSV Mainz 05===
In August 2009, Schürrle made his [[Bundesliga]] debut in a 2–2 draw against [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] on the opening day of the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10 season]].&lt;ref name="schurrleopts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1531919.html | title=Schürrle opts for Leverkusen | publisher=UEFA.com | date=16 September 2010 | accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on 19 September 2009, Schürrle scored his first two league goals in a 3–2 away win against [[VfL Bochum]] before signing a professional contract with the club later in the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,650829,00.html | title=Kurzpässe: Auslosungsmodus der WM-Playoffs unklar, Kuranyi krank | language=German | publisher=Spiegel Online | date=23 September 2009 | accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Mainz announced that Schürrle had signed a five-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen, and would join the club at the end of the [[2010–11 Bundesliga|2010–11 season]]. The transfer fee agreed between the two clubs was believed to be in the region of €8 million.&lt;ref name="schurrleopts" /&gt;

===Bayer Leverkusen===
Schürrle completed his £6.5 million move to Bayer Leverkusen in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1173062-chelsea-transfer-rumours-who-is-andre-schurrle |title=Chelsea Transfer Rumours: Who Is Andre Schurrle? |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; signing a five-year contract with the club until the summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22219166 |title=Andre Schurrle: Chelsea hold transfer talks, say Leverkusen |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his debut in a [[2011–12 DFB-Pokal|DFB Pokal]] tie against [[SG Dynamo Dresden|Dynamo Dresden]]. He had to wait until 15 October 2011 to open his Bundesliga account for Bayer Leverkusen, when he netted a late equalizer against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], rescuing his side a point as the match finished 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2011-12/9/1143367/spielanalyse_borussia-mgladbach-15_bayer-leverkusen-9.html |title=Schürrle rettet Bayer einen Zähler |publisher=kicker |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2013 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schürrle registered his first European goal in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in a home win over [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/clubs/player=250005337/profile/index.html | title=Club History | publisher=UEFA.com}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September, Schürrle scored his first goal of the season against [[FC Augsburg]] in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/346360/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null |title=FC Augsburg 1–3 Bayer Leverkusen |publisher=ESPN FC |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=26 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010033329/http://espnfc.com/en/report/346360/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=null |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fixture against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] on 28 October 2012, Schürrle provided an assist for [[Stefan Kießling]] in a 2–1 win at the [[Allianz Arena]].

Schürrle scored his first [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|Premier League hat-trick]] the following 1 March, against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in a 3–1 away victory in the [[West London derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andre Schurrle's hat-trick sees Chelsea beat Fulham 3–1|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/287558/report|publisher=Sky Sports News | date = 1 March 2014 | accessdate = 11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, he assisted [[Samuel Eto'o]]'s goal in the fifth minute and sent Chelsea into a 2–0 lead in the seventh minute at home to Arsenal; he was awarded Man of the match after Chelsea won 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Premier League: Chelsea destroy 10-man Arsenal 6-0 as referee blunders |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/287588/report|publisher=Sky Sports News | date = 23 March 2014 | accessdate = 11 January 2015 | first = Rob | last = Parrish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April, he scored in Chelsea's second leg [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], to advance to the semi-finals on the away-goals rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/310247 | title = Champions League: Demba Ba's late goal sends Chelsea through against Paris St-Germain | publisher = Sky Sports News | date = 9 April 2014 | accessdate = 11 January 2015 | first = Rob | last = Parrish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first season in England ended with eight goals in 30 Premier League matches.
