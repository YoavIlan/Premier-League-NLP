On 14 August 2012, Gibson joined [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] on a one-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tranmere Rovers sign Ben Gibson from Middlesbrough |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19261010 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month was extended until January 2013 the following month, but in December 2012 was ruled out of action with an abductor problem, thus ending the duration of his first loan spell at Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tranmere Rovers extend Ben Gibson loan deal until January |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19543595 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ben Gibson: Tranmere Rovers loan could be ended by injury |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20717079 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new four-year contract with Middlesbrough on 18 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ben Gibson signs new four-year Middlesbrough deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20772754 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 2013, Gibson returned on loan to Rovers, until the end of the season.&lt;ref name=GibsonLoan2&gt;{{Cite news |title=Gibson Returns To Rovers |url=http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/news/article/gibson-140313-713991.aspx |publisher=Tranmere Rovers F.C. |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Middlesbrough===
The [[2013–14 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2013–14 season]] saw Gibson become more involved in the first team squad for Middlesbrough; the team did not perform well, and manager [[Tony Mowbray]] was sacked in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024081843/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |archivedate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aitor Karanka]] replaced him, and they finished twelfth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3535212,00.html |title=Aitor Named Head Coach |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=29 August 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113125628/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3535212,00.html| archive-date=13 November 2013| dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014–15 Middlesbrough F.C. season|following season]] saw the club finish fourth, qualifying for the [[2015 Football League play-offs|promotion play-offs]]. They reached the final at [[Wembley Stadium]], having won 5–1 on aggregate against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], but were defeated 2–0 by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Middlesbrough 0–2 Norwich City – BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32776552 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2015–16 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2015–16 season]], Gibson helped Middlesbrough secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], having finished as runners-up, behind champions [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 1–1 Brighton: Boro promoted to Premier League – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-v-brighton-championship-promotion-decider-live-boro-albion |accessdate=29 August 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson still remained as a crucial part of Middlesbrough's squad in their [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17 Premier League campaign]], though they did not record positive results; they dropped into relegation zone in March 2017, with Karanka being sacked later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-city-vs-middlesbrough-live-12688922 |title=Stoke City 2–0 Middlesbrough RECAP: Desperately disappointing afternoon as Boro drop into relegation zone |publisher=Gazette Live |date=4 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017 |last=Shaw |first=Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39291081 |title=Aitor Karanka: Middlesbrough sack manager after three and a half years |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11680/10804567/middlesbrough-chairman-steve-gibson-says-tired-aitor-karanka-sacrificed-himself |title=Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson says tired Aitor Karanka 'sacrificed himself' |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=17 March 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relegation back down to the Championship was confirmed in May 2017, after a 3–0 defeat to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], with the club having only been in the English top flight for one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/39854503 |title=Bye Boro!

===Burnley===
Gibson signed for Premier League club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 5 August 2018 on a four-year contract for a joint club-record fee of £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45076206 |title=Ben Gibson: Burnley sign Middlesbrough centre-back for joint club record fee |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2018 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Gibson has competed for the [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17s]], the [[England national under-18 football team|under-18s]], the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] and the [[England national under-21 football team|under-21s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ben Gibson |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/G/Ben%20Gibson |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the under-17 teams that won the 2009 Nordic Cup, where he scored in the final against [[Scotland national under-17 football team|Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland U17s defeated in Nordic Cup final |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/scotland-u17s-defeated-in-nordic-cup-1032775#XXGOhvtxt1FVPhHg.97 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref name="Ben Gibson Middlesbrough"/&gt;

Gibson made his debut for England under-21s in the first leg of the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs]] against [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000413/match=2015235/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Under-21 2015 - History - England-Croatia – UEFA.com |first= |last=uefa.com |date=10 October 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the back of an impressive campaign for Middlesbrough. His performances made him a key member of the under-21 set up and he formed an effective partnership with [[John Stones]].
