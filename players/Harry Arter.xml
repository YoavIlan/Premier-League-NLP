'''Harry Nicholas Arter''' (born 28 December 1989) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on loan from [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]], and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

He began his career at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], progressing through the club's youth academy before making his professional debut in 2007. He was loaned to [[Non-League football|non-league]] sides [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] and [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]] before being released, subsequently joining [[Woking F.C.|Woking]]. After one season at Woking, he returned to [[The Football League]] with Bournemouth, becoming a first team regular following a loan to [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in 2011. He contributed to Bournemouth's promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2013, and to the [[Premier League]] two years later.

Born and raised in England, Arter represents the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] internationally. He played for the nation at [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] level, and made his senior debut in June 2015.

==Early life==
Born in [[Sidcup]], in the London borough of [[Bexley]], to parents Terry and Linda Arter,&lt;ref name="show"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8316166.cherries-arter-keen-to-show-addicks-what-theyre-missing/ |title=Arter keen to show Addicks what they're missing |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was raised in the nearby area of [[Eltham]].&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11543759.AFC_Bournemouth__Charlton_exit_hurt_midfielder_Arter/ |title=AFC Bournemouth: Charlton exit hurt midfielder Harry Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three brothers, Benji, Daniel and Paddy and a sister, Carly.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Charlton Athletic===
He began his career with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Glenda|editor1-last=Rollin|editor2-first=Jack|editor2-last=Rollin|title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2012–2013|year=2012|publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group|Headline]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7553-6356-8|page=434|edition=43rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the club's youth system at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Turning down offers from other clubs to remain with Charlton,&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; he made his professional debut, and only appearance for the club, on 25 September 2007 in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], away to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He came on as an 86th-minute substitute for [[Svetoslav Todorov]] as Charlton lost 3–1 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luton 3–1 Charlton (aet)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008011.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was diagnosed with chronic [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]] in his [[Achilles tendon|achilles]] which eventually ruptured, leading to almost a year out of action.&lt;ref name="stuck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the42.ie/harry-arter-ireland-poland-2011405-Mar2015/ |title=Five years ago, Harry Arter was stuck in the Conference. Now he's eyeing up an Ireland debut |website=the42.ie |last=Kelly |first=Niall |date=25 March 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to fitness, he struggled to break into the first team under new manager [[Phil Parkinson]].&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arter immediately clashed with Parkinson, accusing the manager of "belittling" him by sending him for a trial with non-league side [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] prior to a short loan spell.&lt;ref name="balls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/harry-arter-3-356581 |title=Harry Arter Explains How He Ended Up Playing Non-League Football |website=balls.ie |last=Browne |first=PJ |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later had a loan spell with [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]] as Charlton suffered relegation to [[EFL League One|League One]] and Arter was subsequently released by Parkinson as part of an effort to reduce costs at the club. Arter later expressed his disappointment with the decision, stating "The money I was asking for [...] was nothing. I would have taken anything to stay at the time, so it wasn’t down to finance, it was him (Parkinson) not liking me as a footballer."&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Despite his release, he was allowed to train with Charlton's youth team by coach Steve Avory who had worked with Arter for several years in his youth career.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter later undertook unsuccessful trials with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and even offered to remain with Charlton without pay but was rejected by Parkinson.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt;

===Woking===
On 2 June 2009, Arter joined [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] on a one-year contract along with his former Charlton teammate [[Aswad Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=David|title=New Players|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1487/new-players/|publisher=[[Woking F.C.]]|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-boardman-happy-kingfield-return-4823711 |title=Boardman happy with Kingfield return |publisher=Surrey Live |last=Youlton |first=Clive |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being recommended by assistant manager [[Jimmy Dack]] who had worked with Arter previously at Welling.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter had been waiting for a firm offer to join [[AFC Wimbledon]] but accepted Woking's offer after Wimbledon failed to call back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11697518.AFC_Bournemouth_feature__Harry_Arter_s_rise_from_Conference_South_to_the_top_of_the_Championship/ |title=Harry Arter's rise from Conference South to the top of the Championship |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in the opening day of the 2009–10 season, during a 2–1 victory over his former side Welling United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1566/woking-finish-strongly-for-an-opening-win/ |title=Woking finish strongly for an opening win |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2009, Arter scored a [[hat-trick]] for the club during a 5–0 win over [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1724/hat-trick-harry-/ |title=Hat-trick Harry |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2009–10 season, it was well documented that Arter would be leaving Woking, with several [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs chasing Arter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Arter to remain at Woking despite interest|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8459616.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arter_Bournemouth"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sole, Arter and Sinclair leave Woking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8692865.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woking's website soon confirmed that Arter had agreed to sign for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] with the fee to be decided by an [[The FA|FA]] tribunal, as the two clubs could not agree a transfer fee,&lt;ref name="Arter_Bournemouth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=John|title=Player News|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/2149/player-news/|publisher=Woking F.C.|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Woking hoping to receive around £30,000 for the move after rejecting Bournemouth's initial £2,000 offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15658859.when-i-said-harry-arter-would-reach-the-top-they-looked-at-me-as-if-i-was-an-idiot/ |title=When I said Harry Arter would reach the top, they looked at me as if I was an idiot |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=13 November 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter later described how he had planned to give up football if his season with Woking had failed.&lt;ref name="artful"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/harry-arter-interview-artful-arter-two-wins-from-the-dream-10202511.html |title=Harry Arter interview: Artful Arter two wins from the dream |newspaper=The Independent |last=Pitt-Brooke |first=Jack |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
====2010–11====
On 7 June 2010, Arter joined [[Football League One|League One]] club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, later stated as £4,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14899272.AFC_Bournemouth__We_knew_Harry_Arter_was_worth_more_than___4_000_-_we_thought_he_was_worth_closer_to___10_000_/ |title=We knew Harry Arter was worth more than £4,000 - we thought he was worth closer to £10,000! |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Eddie Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfers – June 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8714557.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=League One guide: Bournemouth – Charlton Athletic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8835277.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had moved to sign Arter after impressing assistant manager [[Jason Tindall]] during a scouting assignment,&lt;ref name="artful"/&gt; with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14586002.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-demanding-year-for-ultimate-professional-harry/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: Demanding year for ultimate professional Harry |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, after impressing during the club's preseason fixtures,&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8332113.cherries-arter-aims-to-put-charlton-disappointment-behind-him/ |title=Arter aims to put Charlton disappointment behind him |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made his debut in their first match of the season, away to his former team Charlton. He was [[Penalty card|booked]] in the first half for a foul on [[Akpo Sodje]] and substituted at half time for [[Michael Symes]] as Bournemouth lost 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlton 1 – 0 Bournemouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8842030.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently dropped from the first team,&lt;ref name="aims"/&gt; not making another start in the league for Bournemouth until November,&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2010/2011"/&gt; having also been hampered by a [[hernia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8396745.cherries-harry-will-play-on-but-faces-surgery/ |title=Harry will play on, but faces surgery |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hernia eventually required surgery, resulting in Arter being ruled out for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8476568.cherries-arter-back-with-a-bang-after-october-nightmare/ |title=Arter back with a bang after October nightmare |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having fallen out of favour under new manager [[Lee Bradbury]], despite being handed a new three-year contract following his appointment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8849262.cherries-bradburys-belief-in-moles-and-arter/ |title=Bradbury's belief in Moles and Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=12  February 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 March 2011, Arter went on a one-month loan to fellow League One team [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in order to gain first team experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carlisle Utd: Harry Arter Joins on Loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/9415686.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he made his debut for the club, replacing [[Liam Noble]] for the last 30 minutes away to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. He scored an extra-time equaliser, the first of his professional career, but a minute later [[Liam Bridcutt]] scored Brighton's winner in a 4–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brighton 4 – 3 Carlisle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9407629.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four further appearances for the club during his loan spell before returning to Bournemouth.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2010/2011"/&gt;

====2011–12====
The sales of [[Danny Hollands]] and [[Anton Robinson]] during the 2011 summer transfer window allowed Arter to gain increased first team experience with Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9181634.cherries-star-arters-pledge-i-can-fill-the-midfield-void/ |title=Cherries star Arter's pledge: I can fill the midfield void|newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2011, Arter replaced [[Mark Molesley]] in the 66th minute of a game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Dean Court]], and 17 minutes later confirmed a 2–0 win with his first goal for the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cherries stroll to first win|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/238821/report|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=Sky Sports|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to score in his two following appearances, a 3–1 defeat to [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] and a 2–1 victory over his former side Carlisle.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt; His performances attracted the attention of several Championship clubs and Bournemouth rejected enquiries from two clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9283535.cherries-arter-focused-only-on-lees-side/ |title=Arter focused only on Lee's side |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before handing him an improved contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9279965.cherries-club-staves-off-championship-interest-in-arter/ |title=Club staves off Championship interest in Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite an upturn in form, Arter suffered from a poor disciplinary record, serving a one-match suspension after collecting five bookings within the first two months of the season and accumulating nine bookings by November. His tally was the worst in League One and led him to seek advice from a sports psychologist in order to control his anger, with the majority of his bookings being due to dissent towards match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9371262.cherries-hot-headed-harry-vows-to-clean-up-act/ |title=Hot-headed Harry vows to clean up act |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually received a two-match ban for receiving his tenth booking of the season a month later and a further three-match ban later in the season for his fifteenth booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9419992.cherries-banned-harry-wary-of-losing-place-in-team/ |title=Banned Harry wary of losing place in team |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9894619.cherries-arter-issues-apology-to-supporters/ |title=Arter issues apology to supporters |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bradbury was dismissed and replaced by former youth team manager [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]], Arter stated that he hoped to be used in a more attacking role after claiming that Bradbury had played him "too defensively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9768112.cherries-arter-relishing-new-attacking-role-after-defensive-claim-over-bradbury/ |title=Arter relishing new attacking role after 'defensive' claim over Bradbury |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he scored 5 goals in 34 league matches during the season as Bournemouth finished in 11th place.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt;

====2012–13====

On 25 August 2012, in his fourth appearance of the 2012–13 season Arter was sent off after 26 minutes of Bournemouth's 1–1 draw at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for two bookable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preston 1–1 Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19304261|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the dismissal, he issued a public apology for the sending off and blamed his "immaturity."&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt; Manager Groves held talks with Arter in an attempt to curb his disciplinary problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9908086.cherries-groves-wants-harry-to-rise-above-red-mist/ |title=Groves wants Harry to rise above red mist |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite accepting his behaviour, Arter also claimed that he was being unfairly treated by referees due to his reputation, commenting "I feel I am being highlighted before a game. [...] I have earned that reputation so it is my fault. But, in another way, it is unfair on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10069667.cherries-arter-claims-he-is-a-target-for-referees/ |title=Arter claims he is a target for referees |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2012, in Eddie Howe's first match back in charge following his reappointment as manager, Arter scored in a 3–1 home win over [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bournemouth 3–1 Tranmere|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19939697|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Howe's first decisions on his return was to sign Arter to an extended contract, set to run until 2015 with Bournemouth retaining the option for a further year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10011319.cherries-manager-howe-this-is-the-ideal-club-for-arter/ |title=Cherries manager Howe: This is the ideal club for Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Howe's return, Arter became a key figure in the side as the club embarked on a fifteen match unbeaten run that moved them into promotion contention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10172636.cherries-arter-focused-despite-speculation/ |title=Arter focused despite speculation |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually losing 1–0 to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10173423.Cherries__Unbeaten_run_bites_the_dust_as_Walsall_claim_victory/ |title=Unbeaten run bites the dust as Walsall claim victory |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving a two-match ban for accumulating ten bookings for the second consecutive season, manager Howe praised Arter and stated his belief that he had "matured" as a player and his bookings were largely due to his combative nature on the field rather than dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10260053.cherries-combative-arter-has-matured-says-howe/ |title='Combative' Arter has matured says Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, he scored 8 goals in 37 league matches, including in a 3–1 win in the penultimate game of the season against Carlisle on 20 April 2013, which secured Bournemouth promotion to the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchener|first1=Mark|title=Bournemouth 3–1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133176|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter described his goal as "the most important goal I have ever scored and one that will probably stick with me for the rest of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10369987.cherries-goal-hero-harry-proud-of-promotion-triumph/ |title=Goal hero Harry proud of promotion triumph | newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14====
Following Bournemouth's promotion to the Championship, they began their campaign against Arter's former side Charlton for the third time in four seasons,&lt;ref name="jinx"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10590400.cherries-arter-keen-to-break-charlton-jinx/ |title=Arter keen to break Charlton jinx |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=3 August 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning 2–1 on the opening day of the season as Arter recorded a victory over his former side for the first time in his career.&lt;ref name="jinx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2013/2014"/&gt; Having featured regularly during the first month of the season, he was ruled out until October through injury before making his return in a 5–2 victory over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] where he scored his first goal in the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/10728357.afc-bournemouth-arter-boosted-by-big-name-arrivals/ |title=Arter boosted by big name arrivals |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter's season ended on 5 April 2014 when he received a straight red card following a foul on [[Junior Hoilett]] during a 2–1 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], gaining a three-match ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11130088.afc-bournemouth-dismissed-arter-relieved-by-victory/ |title=Dismissed Harry Arter relieved by Cherries victory |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the side to a tenth placed finish in their first season in the Championship, the highest placed finish and points total in the club's history,&lt;ref name="push"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11190360.afc-bournemouths-arter-record-finish-meaningless-without-promotion-push-next-season/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Cherries' record finish meaningless without promotion push next season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited Howe with bringing the best out of the club's players and improving his own game in "leaps and bounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11234457.afc-bournemouths-arter-players-should-be-grateful-to-eddie-howe/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Players should be grateful to manager Eddie Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=24 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15====

Despite their record finish, Arter was keen to push for promotion at the start of the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|2014–15 season]] and claimed he would see the season as a failure if the club did not at least reach the playoffs.&lt;ref name="push"/&gt; On 25 October 2014, Arter played as Bournemouth beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 8–0 away to set a club record win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29669693 |title=Birmingham City 0–8 Bournemouth|work=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2014 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season Arter and midfielder [[Andrew Surman]] formed a strong partnership, with Arter more the attacking and Surman the more defensive of the two, with Arter praising his midfield teammate – describing him as "He’s a top player and one we’re fortunate to have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11468907.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-surman-is-perfect-for-our-patient-approach/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Andrew Surman is perfect for our patient approach |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter was named the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) Player of the Month award for December 2014, after scoring in all five matches he played during the month but lost out to Ipswich Town forward [[Daryl Murphy]] in the Football League equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11720837.afc-bournemouth-cherries-star-harry-arter-wins-pfa-player-of-the-month-award/ |title=Cherries star Harry Arter wins PFA player of the month award |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded for his form by signing an improved three and a half year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11731142.afc-bournemouth-arter-targets-fairytale-end-to-cherries-journey/ |title=Harry Arter targets fairytale end to Cherries journey |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter became known for his left footed strikes from range, notably scoring the second goal in the 3–0 home victory over promotion rivals [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and first goal in the 1–1 away draw against second placed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31882584 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 March 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2015, Arter played in the 3–0 home victory against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], the win all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32377069 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Bolton Wanderers |work=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, he scored the second goal in the 3–0 away win against his former club Charlton, the win fully sealed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match in injury time, the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759 |title=Charlton Athletic 0–3 Bournemouth |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into England's top flight in the club's 125-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fchd.info/AFC-BOUR.HTM |title=AFC Bournemouth |publisher=Football Club History Database |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter was one of Bournemouth's prominent players in the season, contributing 9 goals from 43 matches, and subsequently was voted Supporters' Player of the Season and named PFA Championship Player of the Season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James H |url=http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2015/05/26/the-promoted-bournemouth/ |title=The Promoted – Bournemouth |publisher=Fantasy Football Scout |date=26 May 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/12975050.afc-bournemouth-arter-crowned-pfa-fans-player-of-the-year-in-the-championship/ |title=Arter crowned PFA fans’ player of the year in the Championship. |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16====

Following the end of their Championship winning season, Arter sustained a groin injury while on international duty that made him a major doubt for the club's opening fixtures in the [[Premier League]]. After being advised to rest for several weeks, Arter was hopeful of returning in time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13327656.afc-bournemouth-arter-vowing-to-be-ready-for-start-of-pre-season/ |title=Arter vowing to be ready for start of pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually forced to undergo surgery on the problem after visiting a specialist in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13712774.afc-bournemouth-arter-takes-first-steps-on-comeback-trail/ |title=Arter takes first steps on comeback trail |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his first team return on 28 October 2015, playing in the club's 1–0 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13924795.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-it-was-like-harry-arter-had-never-been-away/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: It was like Harry Arter had never been away |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut four days later, on 1 November 2015, as he played 73 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Adam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34630316 |title=Southampton 2–0 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his return was credited with helping the club achieve an upturn in fortunes.&lt;ref name="worst"/&gt;

On 12 December 2015, Arter played in a 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], just days after his wife had given birth to their still born daughter. Despite his grief, he met with manager Howe prior to the match, telling him "I’m training today and playing tomorrow if you want to select me.

====Later years====

Prior to the start of the 2016–17 season, Arter signed a new three-year deal with Bournemouth, set to run until 2019, and called on the squad to aim to improve on the previous season and not simply target avoiding relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14557418.afc-bournemouth-star-arter-more-needed-from-whole-squad-for-premier-boost-not-just-one-or-two/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Arter: More needed from whole squad for Premier boost... not just one or two |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United in the opening game, Arter was sent off in the following match, a 1–0 defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], after receiving a second yellow card for fouling [[Cheikhou Kouyate]]. His first yellow was received for dissent after Premier League officials announced stricter rules on any show of disrespect towards match officials. Despite his sending off, Arter stated "The manager has said if I change the way I play then I become a different player. I just need to cut out those silly bookings chatting back to referees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14744419.afc-bournemouth-star-harry-arter-i-wont-change-the-way-i-play/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Harry Arter: I won't change the way I play |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Meldrum |first=Neil |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started Bournemouth's first 21 league games of the season and earned praise for his firm but was dropped from the side for a match against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in January 2017. He stated that he "hated" being left out of the squad but was restored to the starting line-up for the following match, scoring his first goal of the season in a 6–3 defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15099147.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-i-hated-being-left-out-and-will-give-everything-to-make-sure-it-does-not-happen-again/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: I hated being left out and will give everything to make sure it does not happen again |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter made 35 appearances for Bournemouth during the 2016–17 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/8050/Harry-Arter/stats?co=1&amp;se=54 |title=Harry Arter statistics |publisher=Premier League |date=28 May 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; being rewarded with a new three-year contract set to run until 2021 at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/national/15410315.harry-arter-agrees-new-four-year-deal-with-bournemouth/ |title=Harry Arter agrees new four-year deal with Bournemouth |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Howe praised Arter for improving his disciplinary record, stating that, although he "still had that fiery streak," he had "matured" as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15269113.harry-has-been-able-to-control-his-emotions-a-lot-better-says-howe/ |title=Harry has been able to control his emotions a lot better says Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During pre-season for the 2017–18 season, Arter was monitored by Bournemouth over fitness concerns after playing the majority of the previous season with an achilles injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15360396.arter-will-be-managed-through-pre-season/ |title=Arter will be managed through pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=21 June 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 2017, Arter received media attention after controversially tricking [[Nathaniel Chalobah]] into leaving a free shot on goal by pretending to be one of Chalobah's teammates in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10999130/harry-arter-should-have-been-booked-for-watford-impersonation-says-dermot-gallagher |title=Harry Arter should have been booked for Watford impersonation, says Dermot Gallagher |publisher=Sky Sports |date=21 August 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having started all of his club's opening five matches, he suffered an injury and after returning to the squad following an international break he was unable to regain his first team place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15622716.much-worse-things-in-life-can-happen-arter-reflects-on-being-dropped-from-premier-league-starting-line-up/ |title='Much worse things in life can happen' – Harry Arter reflects on being dropped from Premier League starting line-up |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=26 October 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 13 appearances over the course of the season, his final start coming during a 2–2 draw with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="hard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/16402063.cherries-midfielder-harry-arter-hopes-hard-graft-will-pay-off/ |title=Cherries midfielder Harry Arter hopes hard graft will pay off |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of playing time, manager Howe stated that Arter was not for sale after he was heavily linked with a transfer to rival Premier League side West Ham United, with Arter declaring he was "100% committed" to Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15923738.harry-arter-100-per-cent-committed-to-cherries/ |title=Harry Arter '100 per cent committed' to Cherries |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City (loan)===
Despite stating his desire to remain with Bournemouth in an attempt to force his way back into the first team,&lt;ref name="hard"/&gt; on 9 August 2018, Arter joined newly promoted Premier League side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the 2018–19 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/harry-arter-cardiff-city-bournemouth-15010649 |title=Cardiff City announce the signing of Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter on season-long loan |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Ian Mitchelmore |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting a similar offer from Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.football.london/watford-fc/transfer-news/watford-transfer-cardiff-arter-bournemouth-15010952 |title=Harry Arter rejects Watford approach in favour of move to Cardiff City - reports |website=football.london |last=Spencer |first=Phil |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bournemouth manager Howe admitted that he had taken the decision "reluctantly" as Arter was determined to play first team football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/harry-arter-bournemouth-2-394787 |title=Eddie Howe explains Why Harry Arter Left Bournemouth |website=balls.ie |last=Cooney |first=Gavin |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being ineligible to play against his parent club Bournemouth on the opening day of the season, Arter made his debut for Cardiff in a 0–0 draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 18 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45153217 |title=Cardiff City 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early performances for the club earned praise from Cardiff manager [[Neil Warnock]] who described Arter's contribution as "vital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/harry-arter-inspired-shift-behind-15095942 |title=The Harry Arter-inspired shift behind the scenes at Cardiff City that fills Neil Warnock with survival hope |publisher=WalesOnline |last=Booth |first=Dominic |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Arter played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] under-15, [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] teams, being eligible through his [[Sligo]]-born grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/bournemouth-s-harry-arter-in-ireland-provisional-squad-for-poland-1.2136697|date=12 March 2015|title=Bournemouth's Harry Arter in Ireland provisional squad for Poland|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Republic of Ireland manager [[Martin O'Neill]] said that Arter was on his radar and could be called up to the squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish/2015/0203/677626-oneill-planning-flexible-approach-to-poland-clash/|publisher=RTÉ|date=4 February 2015|title=Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Harry Arter is on his radar|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first call-up for that game on 12 March, following what O'Neill described as a "very good season",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Ned|title=AFC Bournemouth: Cherries midfielder Harry Arter handed maiden Republic of Ireland call-up|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/cherries/clubnews/11851576.AFC_Bournemouth__Arter_handed_maiden_Republic_of_Ireland_call_up/?ref=mac|accessdate=23 March 2015|newspaper=Bournemouth Echo|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not play in it. He made his senior debut on 7 June 2015, as a 63rd-minute substitute for [[Glenn Whelan]] in a 0–0 draw in a friendly against [[England national football team|England]] at the [[Aviva Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=R. of Ireland 0–0 England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32949838|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full international debut against the Netherlands in a 1–1 draw in Dublin on 27 May 2016, in which he was awarded man of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/republic-ireland-holland-international-friendly-match-report |title=Luuk de Jong denies Republic of Ireland morale-boosting win over Holland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Hytner |first=David |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later ruled out of Ireland's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishnews.com/sport/2016/05/31/news/harry-arter-out-of-running-for-euro-squad-spot-541872/ |title=Harry Arter out of running for Euro squad spot |newspaper=The Irish News |last=Spellman |first=Damian |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter made his senior competitive debut for the Republic of Ireland in a 1–0 away win over [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 12 November 2016 in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group D|World Cup qualifying]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diallo|first=Raf|title=Harry Arter reveals how Martin O'Neill "got a reaction" to get Ireland on track in the second half in Austria|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Harry-Arter-reveals-how-Martin-ONeill-got-a-reaction-to-get-Ireland-on-track-in-the-second-half-in-Austria|work=Newstalk|publisher=Communicorp|date=12 November 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Arter made himself unavailable for selection for two matches after a clash with assistant manager [[Roy Keane]]. After sitting out training on medical advice, Arter was confronted by Keane which led to Arter walking out of the team training session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-harry-arter-ireland-15135664 |title=What Roy Keane allegedly told Harry Arter during bust-up |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |last=Spellmore |first=Damian |date=11 September 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arter returned to the Republic of Ireland team for the [[UEFA Nations League]] game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 13 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1015/1003183-i-never-needed-roy-to-say-sorry-arter/ |title =I never needed Roy to say sorry - Arter|date=15 October 2018|work=RTE Sport|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Arter is the brother-in-law of former England captain [[Scott Parker]], who is married to Arter's sister Carly. They both began their careers at Charlton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AFC Bournemouth: Harry Arter ready for Scott Parker battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30590786|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter has frequently cited Parker as a positive influence in his life. When Arter was released by Charlton and struggled to find a new club, Parker let him live in his house and paid him to do oddjobs in order to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13951299.i-would-mow-the-lawn-and-pick-up-the-kids-the-odd-jobs-that-helped-harry-arter-reach-the-premier-league/ |title='I would mow the lawn and pick up the kids' - the odd jobs that helped Harry Arter reach the Premier League |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=7 November 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Harry Arter and his partner, Rachel, suffered a family tragedy when their daughter died at birth. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe paid tribute to Arter following a 2–1 win over Manchester United on 12 December. Howe dedicated the win to Arter and said it had been "a hugely emotional week for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe pays tribute to Harry Arter after death of his child |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-pays-tribute-to-harry-arter-after-death-of-his-child-34282294.html |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe dedicates Manchester United win to Harry Arter |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/10098535/bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-dedicates-manchester-united-win-to-harry-arter |work=Sky Sports |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Arter shared the news of his partner being pregnant again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Good news for Arter after difficult 12 months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37811865.app |work=BBC Football |date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2017, she gave birth to a baby girl, and called her Raine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-39014883|title=Bournemouth's Harry Arter thanks fans for baby congratulations|date=18 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
