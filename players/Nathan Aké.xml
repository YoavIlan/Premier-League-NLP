On 22 April, Aké started alongside [[David Luiz]] and [[César Azpilicueta]] in central defence in Chelsea's 4–2 FA Cup semi-final victory over rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39604653 |title=Chelsea 4–2 Tottenham |date=22 April 2017 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 June 2017, Aké signed a contract with Premier League club AFC Bournemouth on a permanent basis for a club record of £20&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee, with the player officially re-joining the club the following day, when the 2017 transfer window opened.&lt;ref name="BBC_30Jun2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nathan Ake: Bournemouth sign Chelsea defender for a club record fee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40454293 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 June 2017 |date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July, it was reported his former club Chelsea had inserted a buy-back clause for Aké in his transfer contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4068567/buy-back-clause-chelsea-nathan-ake-nathaniel-chalobah-bertrand-traore/ |title=What is a buy-back clause?

==International career==
Aké has represented the Netherlands at every youth level since his under-15 debut in 2009, making 54 appearances in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/nathan-ake/182930/ |title=N. AKÉ |publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has captained both the U17 and the U19 sides. Aké was selected into both squads that won the UEFA European Under-17 Championships in 2011 and 2012 in Serbia and in Slovenia, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1796817.html |title=Captain Aké learns from Chelsea stars |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké was also eligible to represent the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] through his father Moise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2017/05/02/35150672/chelsea-star-ake-could-snub-netherlands-for-ivory-coast |title=Chelsea star Ake could snub Netherlands for Ivory Coast |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké made his senior international debut in a friendly against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], which the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4560108/Morocco-1-2-Holland-Vincent-Janssen-seals-friendly-win.html |title=Ake makes Holland Debut in Friendly |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Aké has been praised for his versatility, being able to play at both full back, centre back and in defensive midfield, which has been attributed to a good work ethic, professionalism and gifted technique. His calmness on the ball and appearance have led to comparisons to former Dutch legend and Chelsea player [[Ruud Gullit]], with his versatility compared to David Luiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2278552/Chelsea-youth-player-Nathan-Ake-looks-like-Ruud-Gullit-plays-like-David-Luiz.html |title=Ruud boy: Chelsea youth star Ake is a mini Gullit with his dreadlocks and cool head |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké said that even though he has played as a defender in recent seasons, he sees himself as a holding midfielder and that his favourite position is in the midfield.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;
