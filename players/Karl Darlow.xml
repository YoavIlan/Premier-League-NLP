'''Karl Darlow''' (born 8 October 1990) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He is the grandson of former [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international forward [[Ken Leek]] who was part of the Welsh [[1958 FIFA World Cup squads|1958 World Cup squad]]. Darlow is a product of the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] academies and spent time on loan at both [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] earlier in his career.

==Club career==

===Nottingham Forest===
Weeks after being released by  [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at the age of 16, Villa goalkeeping coach [[Eric Steele]] recommended Darlow to Forest and he was signed up to their academy. After impressive displays in the reserve team Darlow was awarded a space on the bench where he was present for the majority of the 2010–11 season. His debut was against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], on the last day of the [[Nottingham Forest F.C. season 2010-11|2010–11]] season, as a substitute for [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]]. The Reds won the game 3–0, a result that secured them a play-off spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crystal Palace 0–3 Nott'm Forest |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13247240 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Darlow joined [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in the [[Conference National]] league on loan for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newport County sign young keeper Karl Darlow |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17306918 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Potter Leaves |url=http://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/posts/page179.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910001627/http://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/posts/page179.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 September 2012 |work=newport-county.co.uk |publisher=Newport County A.F.C. |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |first=Chris |last=Blight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New-Port of Call For Karl |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2641925,00.html |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312132430/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2641925,00.html |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for the club in a 1–0 home win against [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newport County AFC V Gateshead |url=http://www.newport-county.co.uk/fixtures/yes/page21.html |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=16 April 2012 |work=newport-county.co.uk |publisher=Newport County A.F.C.}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
On 9 August 2014, Darlow signed a long-term contract with [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for an undisclosed fee. As part of the deal, he and teammate [[Jamaal Lascelles]] were loaned back to Nottingham Forest for the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Anthony |title=United Complete Lascelles And Darlow Deal |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20140809/united-complete-lascelles-and-darlow-deal_2281670_4055609 |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |accessdate=9 August 2014 |date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magpies swoop for Jamaal and Karl |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/magpies-swoop-for-jamaal-and-karl-1802814.aspx |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |accessdate=9 August 2014 |date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut for Newcastle on 25 August 2015, in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] fixture against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] which Newcastle won 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Olsen |first1=Connor |title=Newcastle United 4–1 Northampton Town |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33970053 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 August 2015 |date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut on 28 December 2015, against [[West Bromwich Albion]] as a late inclusion, after regular keeper [[Rob Elliot]] was forced to pull out due to illness; the Magpies lost the game 1–0 after Darlow let [[Darren Fletcher|Darren Fletcher's]] header slip through his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35148468 |title=Fletcher earns WBA win over Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Aimee Lewis |date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a season-ending injury to Elliot while away on international duty, Darlow was forced to take over in net for Newcastle's final 8 matches as they attempted to avoid relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-karl-darlow-you-need-11127866 |title=Who is Karl Darlow: All you need to know about the Newcastle United goalkeeper |work=The Chronicle |first=Stuart |last=Jamieson |date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2016, Darlow saved a penalty from [[Yohan Cabaye]], in a 1–0 Premier League win against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/newcastle-united/361/blog/post/2862412/karl-darlow-the-hero-for-newcastle-in-vital-win-vs-crystal-palace |title=Karl Darlow the hero for Newcastle in vital win vs. Crystal Palace |website=ESPNFC.com |accessdate=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcastle were relegated on 11 May following a victory for rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

Darlow entered the 2016–17 season in a competition with summer signing [[Matz Sels]] to start the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] season in goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/karl-darlow-competition-matz-sels-11680486 |title=Karl Darlow on competition with Matz Sels and wanting to 'put my mark on a game' |work=The Chronicle |first=Andrew |last=Fowler |date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Darlow lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/sport/football/newcastle-united/matz-sels-starts-in-goal-for-newcastle-at-fulham-chancel-mbemba-on-bench-1-8054239 |title=Matz Sels starts in goal for Newcastle at Fulham |work=The Shields Gazette |first=Miles |last=Starforth |date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darlow played in Newcastle's first two League Cup matches against [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton]], picking up clean sheets in both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themag.co.uk/2016/09/newcastles-unluckiest-player-line-change-today-karl-darlow-newcastle-united/ |title=Newcastle’s unluckiest player in line for a change today? |work=The Mag |first=Graham |last=Porter |date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September, Darlow received his first Championship start of the season, replacing Sels against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for a 4–3 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/14770283.TEAM_NEWS__Newcastle_boss_drops_Matz_Sels_for_Norwich_game/ |title=Newcastle boss drops Matz Sels for Norwich game |work=The Northern Echo |first=Scott |last=Wilson |date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the clubs first choice Goalkeeper under [[Rafa Benitez]] ahead of the likes of [[Rob Elliot]], [[Matz Sels]] and [[Freddie Woodman]], Darlow  made 34 appearances, keeping 13 clean sheets in [[2016–17 Newcastle United F.C. season|2016–17]] as Newcastle were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=1502 |title=Championship: 2016/17: Latest table |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darlow would compete with [[Rob Elliot]] during [[2017–18 Newcastle United F.C. season|2017–18 season]] as first choice Goalkeeper in the [[Premier League]], with Darlow making 12 appearances, however both lost their place in the team when [[Martin Dúbravka]] was signed on loan in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sport.aktuality.sk/c/318531/newcastle-a-sparta-sa-dohodli-dubravka-mieri-do-premier-league/|title=Newcastle a Sparta sa dohodli, Dúbravka mieri do Premier League!|language=sk|author=SPORT.SK, s.r.o. &amp; Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia a.s.|publisher=|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started the [[2018–19 Newcastle United F.C. season|2018-19 season]] as 2nd choice behind number 1 goalkeeper [[Martin Dúbravka]], Darlow made his first appearance of the season on 29 August 2018, when he started in the [[EFL Cup]] 3-1 defeat against his old side [[Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45266833 |title=Nottigham Forest 3 Newcastle 1 |website=BBC|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In addition to England, Darlow is eligible to represent Wales as his grandfather [[Ken Leek]] (a Wales international forward) was born in [[Ynysybwl]]. The [[Football Association of Wales]] confirmed Darlow had declined an invitation to join the [[Wales national football team]] squad for the friendly match versus Austria on 6 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/football/newportcounty/10214301.Ex_County_stopper_Karl_Darlow_is_latest_to_say_no_to_a_Wales_call_up/ Darlow declines Wales invitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[Wales national football team|Wales]] Manager [[Ryan Giggs]] approached Darlow in March 2018 to be part of his Wales squad, but Darlow advised he was currently concentrating on winning his place back in the [[Newcastle United]] starting lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-boss-ryan-giggs-contacted-14414937 |title=Wales boss Ryan Giggs contacted Newcastle United duo to clarify international futures |work=Evening Chronicle|first=Lee |last=Ryder|date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
