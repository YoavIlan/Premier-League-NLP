'''Hugo Hadrien Dominique Lloris''' ({{IPA-fr|yɡo joʁis}}; born 26 December 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and is the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of both English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[France national football team|French national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2012-02-28/hugo-lloris-named-as-frances-euro-2012-captain |title=Hugo Lloris named as France's Euro 2012 captain |work=[[Sporting News]] |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711223900/http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2012-02-28/hugo-lloris-named-as-frances-euro-2012-captain |archivedate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris is described as a goalkeeper who "boasts lightning reflexes and good decision-making" and is "a formidable opponent in one-on-one situations". Lloris also "commands his box well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/43372/hugo-lloris?cc=5901 |title=Hugo Lloris ESPN Profile |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His playing style, and in particular his speed when coming off his line to anticipate opponents and clear the ball, has led him to be described as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)#Sweeper-keeper|sweeper-keeper]] in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |title=Tottenham's Hugo Lloris is Premier League's supreme sweeper-keeper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/13/tottenham-hugo-lloris-premier-league-sweeper-keeper |accessdate=11 May 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a three-time winner of the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year]] award.

Lloris began his career with hometown club [[OGC Nice]], made his debut as a teenager in October 2005 and started in goal during the team's run to the [[2006 Coupe de la Ligue Final]]. After excelling at the club for three seasons, Lloris moved to seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions Olympique Lyonnais, amid interest from several other clubs, notably [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Lloris won several domestic awards in his first season with Lyon and, in his second season, earned award nominations at European level for his performances in the [[UEFA Champions League]], which saw Lyon reach the semi-finals for the first time.

Lloris is a [[France national football team|French international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]], and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. Prior to playing at senior level, he played on the under-19 team that won the [[2005 European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Lloris made his senior international debut in November 2008 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He helped France qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and was applauded by the media for his performance over two legs against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|qualifying playoffs]]. He captained the national team for the first time in 2010, and became first-choice captain on 28 February 2012, leading France into the quarter-finals of both [[Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], runners-up at [[Euro 2016]], and winners at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early and personal life==
Lloris was born on 26 December 1986 in the [[Southern France|Mediterranean]] city of [[Nice]] to an upper-class family. His mother was a lawyer and his father is a [[Monte Carlo]]-based banker of [[Pays Catalan|Catalan]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesechos.fr/22/06/2012/LesEchos/21211-189-ECH_hugo-lloris.htm |title=Hugo Lloris |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2015 |work=Les Échos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="hugo_lloris"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=673250&amp;cc=5901 |title=Champions League 2009–10, Group E |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philippebilger.com/blog/2010/04/hugo-lloris-un-dernier-rempart.html |title=Hugo Lloris: un dernier rempart |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=Philippe Bilger |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother, [[Gautier Lloris|Gautier]], who currently plays as a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]] for his older brother's former club [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/gautier-lloris-sur-les-traces-de-son-frere-08-03-2011-1348292.php |title=Gautier Lloris sur les traces de son frère |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cote-d-azur.france3.fr/info/nice-en-finale-de-la-coupe-gambardella-a-paris-73609914.html |title=Nice en finale de la Coupe Gambardella à Paris |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |work=France 3 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, while Lloris was playing for Nice, his mother died. Just two days after her death, he gained national respect for his refusal of a [[Grief|bereavement]] leave offer from manager [[Frédéric Antonetti]], instead opting to play in a league match for Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=773826&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;root=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5901 |title=Lloris the key for Lyon's hopes |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris performed admirably in the match despite the circumstances. As a youth, like his international and club teammate [[Yoann Gourcuff]], Lloris excelled at tennis and played the sport up until the age of 13. He was among the top players in his age group, ranking high in the country's national standings before opting to focus on football.&lt;ref name ="hugo_lloris" /&gt;

On 10 August 2010, Lloris was named, alongside international teammate [[Karim Benzema]], to appear on the cover of the French version of ''[[FIFA 11]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.info-utiles.fr/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4182 |title=EA-Sport signe Hugo LLoris pour FiFa 11 |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2010 |publisher=Info Utiles |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2010, he announced the birth of his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.olweb.fr/fr/Actualites-sportives/100005/En-bref/54197/Carnet-rose |title=Carnet rose |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010 |publisher=[[Olympique Lyonnais]] |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014409/http://www.olweb.fr/fr/Actualites-sportives/100005/En-bref/54197/Carnet-rose |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2018, Lloris was charged with [[Driving under the influence|drink-driving]] after being stopped by police in west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45297105 |title=Hugo Lloris: Tottenham goalkeeper charged with drink-driving |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2018 |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris later pleaded guilty at [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]] and admitted to being more than twice the drink-drive limit. He was fined £50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45482366 |title=Hugo Lloris admits drink-driving charge |date=2018-09-12 |work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-12 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lloris began his football career at age six playing at CEDAC (Centre de Diffusion et d'Action Culturelle), a local [[cultural center]] based in the neighborhood of [[Cimiez]], Nice.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=22&amp;id=AT2539 |title=Pouplin – Lloris : Deux garçons pleins d'avenir |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 |publisher=[[Stade Rennais F.C.]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |title=Présentation du CEDAC Cimiez |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=CEDAC Cimiez |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409081208/http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |archivedate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre offered a variety of activities, which included football. Lloris played a variety of positions at the centre, such as [[Striker (association football)|in the attack]], before switching to the goalkeeper position after coaches noticed that he possessed impressive goalkeeping qualities, such as ball-handling and catching skills.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons" /&gt; Lloris excelled at the position and caught the attention of former [[OGC Nice]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and French international [[Dominique Baratelli]], who recommended that the player join his former club. At the age of ten, Lloris joined Nice's youth academy.&lt;ref name ="deux_garçons" /&gt; He spent several years in the club's youth academy and was the starting goalkeeper for the club's under-17 team that won the 2003–04 edition of the ''Championnat Nationaux des 18 ans'', a country-wide domestic league competition for players under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ogcnissa.com/fr.php?Rubrique=articles&amp;id_art=1916 |title=Bilan des 18 ans Nationaux |date=22 May 2004 |accessdate=22 March 2011 |publisher=OGC Nissa |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
[[File:Hugo Lloris.JPG|thumb|175px|left|Lloris in 2005 with [[OGC Nice|Nice]]]]
After success with the club's under-18 team, Lloris was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of French football, for the 2004–05 season. He alternated the starting goalkeeper spot with Hilaire Munoz as he appeared in 12 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stat2foot.com/nopclubs/nice20405.htm |title=O.G.C.

He was designated by manager [[Frédéric Antonetti]] as the team's starting goalkeeper for the club's [[Coupe de la Ligue]] campaign ahead of fan-favourite (and fellow Nice native) [[Damien Gregorini]], who was relied more upon in league play. Lloris made his professional debut on 25 October 2005, at the age of 18, recording a clean sheet in Nice's 2–0 Coupe de la Ligue win over [[LB Châteauroux|Châteauroux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120711075823/http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 11 July 2012 |title=Nice v.

Nice Match Report |date=22 April 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloris made his league debut on 18 March 2006 against Nancy picking up a [[clean sheet]] in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120712074225/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 12 July 2012 |title=Nice v. Nancy Match Report |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four more league appearances that season. The [[2006–07 Ligue 1|following season]], Lloris was given the starting job permanently ahead of Gregorini, who subsequently departed the club for Nancy. Lloris appeared in all but one league match recording 13 clean sheets as Nice finished in 16th place. Despite the disappointing finish, the club was the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals. Only veterans [[Grégory Coupet]], [[Cédric Carrasso]] and [[Ulrich Ramé]] conceded fewer. For the early part of the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]], Lloris endured a recurring ligament injury in his left knee, which forced him to miss three weeks in September. He returned to the team on 6 October 2007 in a league match against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]], but was substituted out after 71 minutes after the injury relapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/ligue-1/2007-2008/lloris-le-bout-du-tunnel_sto1387435/story.shtml |title=Lloris le bout du tunnel |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Eurosport |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712112513/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Le Mans v. Nice Match Report |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris missed a further six weeks before returning on 24 November in the team's 2–1 victory over [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51400 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730080620/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51400 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Nice v. Paris SG Match Report |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared consistently with the team for the rest of the season as Nice finished in 8th place, the club's best finish in the league since finishing 6th in the [[1988–89 French Division 1|1988–89 season]]. Lloris conceded only 24 goals in his 30 appearances recording 13 clean sheets. He contributed to a defense that only conceded 30 overall during the season, tied for the league-best. Lloris' efforts that season led to him being approached by several big European clubs with hopes of signing him for the future.

===Lyon===
After another solid season with Nice, speculation arose as to where Lloris would play the following season. He was primarily linked to French club [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], who wanted him to replace the departing Grégory Coupet, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who wanted him to replace the Brazilian [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], who wanted Lloris to replace [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.soccernews.com/lyon-deny-coupet-rumours/2325/ |title=Lyon deny Coupet rumours |date=23 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Soccer News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eyefootball.com/news/5681/Hugo-Lloris-to-AC-Milan/ |title=Hugo Lloris to AC Milan |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Eye Football}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3622045,00.html |title=Lloris open to Spurs talks |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[Sky Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reportedly coming to personal terms with Milan, Lloris snubbed the Italian club for seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions Lyon.

====2008–09 season====
Lloris made his club debut in the team's opening league match of the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]] on 10 August 2008 against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. Lyon won the match 3–0 win giving the goalkeeper his first career clean sheet with the club.&lt;ref name="Lyon v.

Lloris was, subsequently, named the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|top goalkeeper]] and also named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football#2009|Team of the Year]].

====2009–10 season====
In the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]], Lloris remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper and opened the new campaign by recording four clean sheets in the club's first eight matches. For his performances in the month of September, he was awarded the [[UNFP Player of the Month]] becoming the first goalkeeper since [[Steve Mandanda]] in August 2008 to receive the award. Lloris earned media praise for his performances against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the first match, played at [[Anfield]], Lloris made four saves holding Liverpool to only one goal. Lyon won the match 2–1. In the second match at the [[Stade Gerland]], he produced stops from shots by [[Fernando Torres]], [[Dirk Kuyt]] and [[Andriy Voronin]] in the first half, then displayed reflexes to deny the Brazilian [[Lucas Leiva|Lucas]] midway through the second period. Though Lyon conceded late, the team drew the match 1–1 with a goal from [[Lisandro López]] in [[injury time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1128744.html |title=Lyon delight, Liverpool despair |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000028/match=2000413/index.html |title=Lyon through as Liverpool teeter |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2009, Lloris, alongside Marseille and France's number two goalkeeper [[Steve Mandanda]], each conceded five goals in a [[Choc des Olympiques#Notable matches|thrilling 5–5 draw]] between Lyon and Marseille, though most of the goals conceded were attributed to "slack defending" displayed by both clubs as described by the media and both managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/44961 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120713172345/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/44961 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 13 July 2012 |title=Lyon v.

Lloris remained consistent during the 2010 portion of the season conceding only two goals in the club's first four matches of the year with Lyon winning all of them and Lloris picking up two clean sheets. On 16 February, Lloris earned a clean sheet in Lyon's first leg of its [[UEFA Champions League]] knockout round match against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Lloris made two saves in the team's 1–0 victory making a finger-tipping save from a deflected [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] shot in the 61st minute and producing a reflex save on a shot from [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] three minutes later to keep Lyon ahead on the scoreline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/16/lyon-real-madrid-latest-score |title=Lyon v Real Madrid – as it happened! |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Lutz |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-cup/news/news.aspx?id=4289941 |title=Rooney, United edge Milan; Lyon stuns Real |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |publisher=Sports Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180806/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-cup%2Fnews%2Fnews.aspx%3Fid%3D4289941 |archivedate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon later achieved qualification to the quarterfinals in the competition after drawing 1–1 in [[Madrid]] with Lloris conceding the opening goal to Cristiano Ronaldo in the sixth minute. It was the goalkeeper's first goal conceded in over 620 minutes. On 2 May, Lloris provided the assist on the game-winning goal scored by [[Michel Bastos]] in Lyon's 1–0 win over [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/45019 |title=Montpellier v.

====2010–11 season====
Ahead of the [[2010–11 Ligue 1|2010–11 season]], Lloris was nominated for the UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year award at the [[UEFA Club Football Awards]], but lost out on the award to [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]]-winning keeper [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]] of [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=814888&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5901 |title=Inter Milan players lead UEFA award nominations |date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/inters-champions-beat-allcomers-at-uefa-club-awards-2063126.html |title=Inter's champions beat all-comers at Uefa club awards |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Gordon |last=Tynan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season, Lloris performed well, despite conceding a career-high 40 goals in the league as Lyon failed to win the league for the third consecutive season. The frustrating season for the club and Lloris himself reached its zenith on 3 April 2011 following the club's 2–2 away draw with Lloris' former club Nice. Despite being up 2–0 heading into injury time, Lyon conceded two goals within two minutes of each other, an [[Éric Mouloungui]] penalty and a goal at the death from [[Renato Civelli]], allowing Nice to leave the match with a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53938 |title=Nice v.

Lloris appeared in all five matches the team played in the competition. He made only five appearances with the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]], primarily because of his commitments to the senior team. On 11 October 2008, with the under-21 squad attempting to qualify for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], coach [[Erick Mombaerts]] called up Lloris to the team for their important two-legged playoff against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]], despite him having been called up to the senior team and the player having last played for the team in August 2007. Lloris honored the call up and started the second leg. With France seconds away from a spot in the tournament, because of the team's 1–1 draw in the first leg, Germany got a late goal from [[Benedikt Höwedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/fiche_joueur_new/match.php?id_match=41 |title=France v. Germany Match Report |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[French Football Federation]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1–0 loss eliminated France from the competition and also ended Lloris's under-21 career.

Lloris received his first call-up to the senior national team for France's 6 February 2008 match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. However, he instead played for [[France B national football team|the B team]] in their friendly match against the [[Congo DR national football team|Congo DR]], held the day before the Spain friendly. After receiving several more call ups in 2008, he finally earned his first cap on 19 November 2008 in a 0–0 draw with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. On 9 September 2009, Lloris received his first international [[Penalty card|red card]], against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], following a foul on [[Nikola Žigić]] in the penalty box, despite replays showing otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten-man France rouse to deny Serbia |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=302415/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708044400/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=302415/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |work=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris returned to the team on 14 October playing the entire 90 minutes in the team's 3–1 win over [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

Lloris was applauded by the media and players, alike, for his performance over two legs against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] that saw France earn a spot in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] finals. Former national team goalkeeper Grégory Coupet credited his performance as "phenomenal", while the French media described him as "Saint Lloris", which is a play on the nickname of Real Madrid counterpart [[Iker Casillas]], who was considered one of the top goalkeepers in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coupet hails "phenomenal" Lloris |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=699655&amp;cc=5901 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Les Bleus avec Saint Lloris et sans Gourcuff |url=http://fr.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1136808.html |work=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121045207/http://fr.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1136808.html |archivedate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saint Lloris, Priez pour nous |url=http://www.football365.fr/france/equipe-de-france/article_362596_france-eire-la-performance-des-bleus-Saint-Lloris-priez-pour-nous-.shtml |work=Football 365 |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2010, Lloris was named in Domenech's 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 World Cup, later being named to the final 23-man team and installed as first-choice goalkeeper. On 11 June 2010, Lloris made his [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals debut in the team's opening group stage match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], earning a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uruguay 0–0 France |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_02/default.stm |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloris appeared in both of France's other group stage matches, against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and hosts [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]]. Against South Africa, Lloris committed a goalkeeping error which resulted in the opening goal for the hosts. He redeemed himself later in the match, however, by producing several saves to limit the South Africans' chances of progressing to the knockout rounds. France lost the match 2–1, which resulted in the hosts' elimination from the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2010: France v South Africa – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/22/world-cup-2010-france-south-africa-live |work=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloris started for his country in the final tournament, as they reached the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated following a 2–0 loss to eventual champions Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/spain/9344376/Spain-2-France-0-match-report.html |title=Spain 2 France 0: match report |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=Mark Ogden |date=23 June 2012 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started for France at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], helping the team to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated 1–0 by eventual champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/04/france-germany-world-cup-2014-quarter-final-match-report |title=Germany reach World Cup semi-finals as Mats Hummels header sinks France |publisher=The Guardian |author1=David Hytner |date=4 July 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloris was the starting goalkeeper of the French squad that reached the [[UEFA Euro 2016 Final|final]] of [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] on home soil, only to be defeated 1–0 by [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000451/match=2017907/index.html |title=Portugal 1–0 France |publisher=UEFA |first1=Joseph |last1=Walker |first2=David |last2=Crossan |date=10 July 2016 |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2018, Lloris earned his 100th cap in France's 1–0 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in their second group stage game of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ae/news/cest-magnifique-lloris-earns-100th-france-cap/1ppe65sstl7eh1tgk9wngdy7qf |title=C'est magnifique!

On 15 July, he lifted the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] as his team's captain, as France defeated [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] with a 4–2 victory in the [[2018 World Cup Final|final]], despite his mistake which allowed Croatia's [[Mario Mandžukić]] to score a goal as Lloris tried to dribble past him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report |title=France seal second World Cup triumph with 4–2 win over brave Croatia |work=The Guardian |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
