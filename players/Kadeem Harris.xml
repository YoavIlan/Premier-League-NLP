==Career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Westminster]], London,&lt;ref name="Hugman2010–11 188" /&gt; Harris once held the record for the youngest player ever to appear for Wycombe in the [[Football League]], breaking [[Ikechi Anya]]'s record set in 2004 by coming on as a substitute for the final 12 minutes against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in December 2009, aged 16 years and 201 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10430~1915891,00.html|title=HARRIS: "I'M OVER THE MOON"|last=|first=|date=29 December 2009|work=|access-date=13 April 2011|publisher=Wycombe Wanderers F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wycombe Wanderers===
Harris made his home debut for the club against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on the last day of the [[2009–10 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season|2009–10]] season.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2009/2010" /&gt; He found his chances for first team football limited in the [[2010–11 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season|2010–11]] season, only featuring for 25 minutes in the [[Football League Trophy]] tie with [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2010/2011" /&gt; He scored his first goal for the first team in the quarter-final of the [[Berks &amp; Bucks Senior Cup]] against [[Burnham F.C.|Burnham]]. Harris was awarded the [[Football League Two|League Two]] Apprentice of the Year at the Football League Awards in April 2011 and later that month was one of four Wycombe scholars to be awarded professional contracts by the club.&lt;ref name="AOTY"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10430~2320659,00.html |title=Harris Wins League Award |date=1 April 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |publisher=Wycombe Wanderers F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four sign Wycombe Wanderers pro contracts|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13051517.stm| work=BBC Sport| date=12 April 2011| accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was subject to a £50,000 bid by [[Premier League]] side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in July 2011 but the offer was rejected by Wycombe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Waddock confirms Harris bid|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/sport/localsport/9124965.Waddock_confirms_Harris_bid/| publisher=Bucks Free Press| date=6 July 2011| accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris made a late cameo appearance on the first day of the [[2011–12 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season|2011–12]] season against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], replacing [[Joel Grant]].&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2011/2012" /&gt; He then made his first start in a competitive match for Wycombe in the [[League Cup]] during Wycombe's clash with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on 9 August 2011.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2011/2012" /&gt; Wycombe won on penalties but the game also saw Harris' record as youngest player broken by Jordon Ibe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wycombewanderers.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10430~2415846,00.html|title=Wycombe Wanderers {{!}} News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} JORDAN SETS NEW CLUB RECORD|website=www.wycombewanderers.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2011, Harris made his first league start for club in a 1–0 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wycombe 1–0 Sheffield Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14958080.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a first team regular and 22 appearances during the first half of the 2011–12 season,&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2011/2012" /&gt; before departing the club in January 2012.&lt;ref name="JoinsCardiff" /&gt; Harris made 26 appearances in all competitions for Wycombe and scored no goals.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase" /&gt;

===Cardiff City===

On 30 January 2012, Harris signed for [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a three-and-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="JoinsCardiff"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cardiffcity.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2593968,00.html |title=Kadeem Harris joins Cardiff City |date=30 January 2012 |access-date=30 January 2012 |publisher=Cardiff City F.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maiden call up to the first team came in a 3–1 league defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 4 February 2012, when he was an unused substitute.&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1112"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2011 |title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC |website=www.espnfc.com |access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unused substitute on a further three occasions during the [[2011–12 Cardiff City F.C. season|2011–12]] season and was not called into the squad for the [[2012 Football League play-offs#Championship|playoffs]] or the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|2012 League Cup final]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1112" /&gt; Harris was only called into the first team squad on one occasion during the [[2012–13 Cardiff City F.C. season|2012–13]] Championship-winning season, when he made his debut in a 2–1 [[FA Cup]] third round defeat against [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] on 5 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2012|title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC|website=www.espnfc.com|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris started the match and was substituted for [[Tommy O'Sullivan]] after 64 minutes.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kadeem Harris in 2012/2013" /&gt; Harris received his first call into the first team squad of the [[2013–14 Cardiff City F.C. season|2013–14]] season on 28 August 2013, when he was an unused substitute for a 2–0 League Cup first round win over [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1314"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/142244/kadeem-harris?season=2013 |title=Kadeem Harris Player Profile – ESPN FC |website=www.espnfc.com |access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again an unused substitute in the following round, which saw Cardiff lose 3–2 to fellow Premier League side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="ESPNFC1314" /&gt;

====Loans Spells====
After putting in an "outstanding" performance for Cardiff in a [[Professional Development League]] game versus [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/news/article/cardiff-city-ds-v-brentford-ds-14.10.13-1112867.aspx|title=CARDIFF CITY DS 3 BRENTFORD DS 1|author=Chris Wickham|work=brentfordfc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 October 2013 Harris joined the [[League One]] side on a loan running until 5 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24581153|title=Kadeem Harris: Brentford sign Cardiff winger on loan|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was included in the squad to face [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and after replacing [[Will Grigg]] on 65 minutes, he scored the first senior goal of his career in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harris scored his second Brentford goal in an FA Cup first round tie against local neighbours [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] on 9 November, scoring the second in a 5–0 victory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harris was stretchered off with a hamstring problem in a 3–0 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 21 December, casting doubt on his loan being extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/on-loan-cardiff-city-winger-suffers-6439041|title=On-loan Cardiff City winger suffers injury blow against Preston|author=Matt Lewis|date=21 December 2013|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December it was reported that Harris would be out for a month, with manager [[Mark Warburton]] keen on extending the loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bees-plan-extend-loan-injured-6447109|title=Bees plan to extend the loan of injured Cardiff City youngster|author=Jacob Murtagh|date=26 December 2013|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris [[Twitter|tweeted]] on 29 December that he would be returning to Cardiff, leaving plans to extend his loan up in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KadeemHarris27/status/417359585759199232|title=Kads|work=Twitter|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris made 11 appearances for Brentford and scored two goals.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=52670 |title=Kadeem Harris – Football Stats – Cardiff City – Age 22 – Soccer Base |website=soccerbase.com |access-date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in mid-March 2014 that Harris was close to a return to the Bees to cover for the injured [[Sam Saunders (footballer)|Sam Saunders]], despite being sidelined with an ankle injury himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/brentford-ponder-swoop-cardiff-city-6803302|title=Brentford ponder swoop for Cardiff City winger|author=Jacob Murtagh|date=12 March 2014|work=getwestlondon|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Harris started to become a regular under new manager, [[Russell Slade]], who was appointed in October.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt; He played his first league game for Cardiff in a 5–3 loss to [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], on 20 December.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt; Harris scored his first goal for ''The Bluebirds'' in a [[FA Cup]] win against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], following this with his first league goal against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1415" /&gt;

On 22 August 2015, Harris joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on loan until 21 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Loan Deal: Harris links up with Tykes|url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/loan-deal-harris-links-up-with-tykes-2638055.aspx|publisher=Cardiff City|date=22 August 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a goalless draw against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and went onto make 14 appearances for Barnsley before returning to Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1516" /&gt;

===Return to first team===
In August 2016, Harris received a lot of praise from Cardiff fans and manager, [[Paul Trollope]], after his performances against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in an unusual [[right wing back]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Kadeem Harris has played his way into contention for a starting spot as Cardiff City youngsters lead the way |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kadeem-harris-played-way-contention-11779342 |work=South Wales Echo |first=Phil |last=Smith |date=21 August 2016 |accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris continued to impress under new manager, [[Neil Warnock]] and eventually found his first goal on 14 January, scoring in the [[Severnside derby]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1617" /&gt; He followed this by scoring two to help Cardiff come back from 2 goals down to beat [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], 4–3, before scoring his third in two games against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1617" /&gt;

His performance throughout the season saw Harris gifted the number 11 shirt for the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2017/18 Squad Numbers Confirmed! |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/august/201718-squad-numbers-confirmed/ |publisher=Cardiff City Official Site |date=2 August 2017 |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an ankle injury suffered during pre-season ruled him out for 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kadeem Harris sidelined for up to three months with Cardiff City star needing ankle surgery |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kadeem-harris-sidelined-up-three-13431376 |work=South Wales Echo |date=4 August 2017 |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several games for the under-23 side, Harris eventually made his return to the first team in a 0–0 draw at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], replacing [[Junior Hoilett]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1718" /&gt;

Harris scored his first goal since returning from injury in the [[2018–19 Cardiff City F.C. season|2018–19 season]], in a 4–2 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the [[Premier League]], Cardiff's first win of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–2 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45847412 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
