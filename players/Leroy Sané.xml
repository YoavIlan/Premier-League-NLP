In July 2017, Sané revealed he believed his debut season at City had been limited by his inability to breathe through his nose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He said he particularly suffered during matches, with his constantly blocked nose hampering his performance and causing him intense frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/leroy-sane-manchester-city-nose-10875407 |title=Leroy Sane gets a nose job as he looks to get Man City career back on track |last=Association |first=Press |date=26 July 2017 |work=mirror|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opted to have corrective surgery during the off-season break. Although this caused him to miss that year's [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|FIFA Confederations Cup]], he said his chronic nasal congestion was becoming increasingly unbearable for him and that he wished to enter the next season feeling happy and healthy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://talksport.com/football/nose-surgery-rules-manchester-city-and-germany-winger-leroy-sane-out-2017-confederations |title=Nose surgery rules Manchester City and Germany winger Leroy Sane out of 2017 Confederations Cup |last=talkSPORT |date=23 May 2017 |work=talkSPORT|access-date=5 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
