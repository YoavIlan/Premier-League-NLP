After starting out at [[Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória]], he moved to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], remaining with the club for five seasons (three complete). He joined Chelsea in January 2011, [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|winning the UEFA Champions League]] during the 2011–12 season.

David Luiz made his full international debut for Brazil in 2010 and has since earned over 50 caps for his country.

==Club career==

===Vitória===
Born in [[Diadema, São Paulo]], to Ladislao and Regina Marinho, David Luiz arrived at [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]-based club [[Esporte Clube Vitória|Vitória]] after being released by [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvabcd.com.br/noticias/1058/david-luiz-e-o-representante-de-diadema-na-selecao-brasileira|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110706154639/http://www.tvabcd.com.br/noticias/1058/david-luiz-e-o-representante-de-diadema-na-selecao-brasileira|archivedate=6 July 2011|title=David Luiz é o representante de Diadema na Seleção Brasileira|trans-title=David Luiz represents Diadema in Brazil national team|publisher=Tvabcd|language=pt|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started playing as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], almost leaving the club for his poor performances in that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=pt|url=http://br.esporteinterativo.yahoo.com/noticias/spt---pensei-em-dispensar-volante-david-luiz---revela-treinador-da-base-do-vit%C3%B3ria--veja--223832836.html|title="Pensei em dispensar David Luiz", revela coordenador da base do Vitória.

Look!|publisher=[[Esporte Interativo]]|website=[[Yahoo!]]|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was soon moved to central defender and adapted well.&lt;ref name=gterra&gt;{{cite news|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI4587001-EI6583,00-Zagueiro+convocado+por+Mano+e+avaliado+em+R+milhoes.html|author=Eliano Jorge|title=Zagueiro convocado por Mano é avaliado em R$ 114,5 milhões|trans-title=Stopper selected by Mano is worth R$ 114,5 millions|publisher=Gterra|language=pt|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz made his official debut for Vitória in 2006, excelling in a 2–2 draw against [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz]] for [[2006 Copa do Brasil|that season]]'s [[Copa do Brasil]].&lt;ref name=gterra/&gt; At the worst situation of its history, in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|third division]], the club eventually [[2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|promoted]] to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|second level]] after finishing in second position, with the player appearing in eight of the club's last decisive nine games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campeoesdofutebol.com.br/clas_seriec_2006.html|title=Campeonato Brasileiro Série C – 2006|publisher=Campeoes do Futebol|language=pt|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring his only league goal on 3 September 2006 in a 2–0 home win against [[Clube Atlético do Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitória|publisher=Futebol 80|language=pt|url=http://www.futebol80.com.br/links/times/vitoria/vitoriajg.htm|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benfica===
On 30 January 2007, David Luiz joined Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] as a replacement for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]-bound [[Ricardo Rocha (footballer, born 1978)|Ricardo Rocha]], on loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=503237.html Benfica replace Ricardo Rocha]; UEFA, 1 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He made a somewhat tumultuous debut for the club in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] match against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] at the [[Parc des Princes]], partnering compatriot [[Anderson Cléber Beraldo|Anderson]] in the centre of defence, replacing the injured [[Luisão]]. Benfica lost the match 2–1, but managed [[2006–07 UEFA Cup|to progress to the next round]] after winning 4–3 on aggregate.

On 12 March 2007, he played his first [[Primeira Liga|league]] match for Benfica, against [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/games/?game=4858|title=Tactical Formation|publisher=Football-Lineups|accessdate=14 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112156/http://www.football-lineups.com/games/?game=4858|archivedate=11 October 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|the season]], David Luiz signed a five-year deal with the club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=544985.html David Luiz banking on Benfica]; UEFA, 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the season, following ten league appearances, he joined permanently for [[Euro|€]]1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt; Before the ensuing campaign, he scored his first goal for the club in the [[Guadiana Trophy]] friendly tournament, against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. David Luiz only managed eight appearances in the [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|league]] due to injury, however, as Benfica finished fourth.

On 11 January 2009, David Luiz netted his first official goal for Benfica, the game's only in a home success against [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. He played most of [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|the campaign]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]], at the expense of [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese international]] [[Jorge Ribeiro]].

However, it was on the [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|2009–10 season]], when new manager [[Jorge Jesus]] arrived to Benfica, that David Luiz became a club symbol and vice-captain. He was ever-present, appearing in 49 official matches (three goals, 4,206 minutes), as Benfica won the league after a five-year wait. In [[2009–10 Taça da Liga|the season]]'s [[Taça da Liga]], in a 1–4 away win against Sporting CP, he opened the score in the eighth minute, with Benfica also eventually winning the competition. David Luiz won the [[LPFP Primeira Liga Player of the Year|Portuguese Liga Player of the Year]] that same season, with 38% of the vote while the runner-up, his teammate [[Ángel Di María]], received 8%.&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt;

On 30 September 2009, Benfica sold 25% of David Luiz's economic rights on any future transfer to a [[Third-party ownership in association football|third-party owner]], [[Benfica Stars Fund]], along with other teammates. He was tagged at €18&amp;nbsp;million, with the fund paying €4.5&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR25467.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=CMVM|language=pt|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his contract was also renewed in October, with a release clause of €50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR25595.pdf|title=Comunicado|trans-title=Announcement|publisher=CMVM|language=pt|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=9 October 2017|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:David Luiz Moreira Marinho.jpg|thumb|upright|David Luiz playing for Chelsea in 2011]]

On 31 January 2011, David Luiz completed a move to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee of €25&amp;nbsp;million, a five-and-a-half-year contract, with [[Nemanja Matić]] joining Benfica at the end of the season after his transfer spell away at [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 January 2011|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/874012/chelsea-bolster-defence-with-L21.3m-david-luiz-signing?cc=5901|title=Chelsea complete £21.3m Luiz signing]|work=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=24 June 2014|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2281533|title=David Luiz signs|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713002144/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10268~2281533%2C00.html|archivedate=13 July 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Luiz transferido para o Chelsea|accessdate=22 June 2011|url=http://www.slbenfica.pt/Informacao/Futebol/Noticias/noticiasfutebol_futcomunicadodavidluiz_310111_73255.asp|archivedate=7 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407063753/http://www.slbenfica.pt/Informacao/Futebol/Noticias/noticiasfutebol_futcomunicadodavidluiz_310111_73255.asp|publisher=S.L.

He made his official [[Premier League]] debut on 6 February, replacing [[José Bosingwa]] in a 0–1 home loss against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9385584.stm|title=Chelsea 0–1 Liverpool|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=6 February 2011|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, he made his first start for Chelsea in a 0–0 draw against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]]. Instantly becoming a cult hero amongst the Chelsea fans, David Luiz was awarded the Barclays [[Man of the Match]] award for his performance, despite giving away a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in the 93rd minute of the game, which was saved by [[Petr Čech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|department=BBC Sport|date=14 February 2011|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9391010.stm|title=Fulham 0–0 Chelsea|first=Mark|last=Ashenden|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz was a member of Brazil's [[2015 Copa América squads#Brazil|squad]] for the [[2015 Copa América]] in Chile. He partnered [[Miranda (footballer)|Miranda]] in central defence for the team's first two [[2015 Copa América Group C|group matches]], before being dropped for Thiago Silva, as Brazil were knocked out by [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[2015 Copa América knockout stage#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/copa-america/83/blog/post/2500668/brazil-learning-to-play-without-neymar-is-a-sign-of-progress|title=Brazil and Dunga learning to play without Neymar is a sign of progress|date=21 June 2015|work=ESPN|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2015, David Luiz received his first career [[Ejection (sports)|red card]] in a 1–1 [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2018 World Cup qualifying]] draw with [[Argentina–Brazil football rivalry|rivals]] [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=11/news=brazil-fightback-thwarts-argentina-2732803.html|title=Brazil fightback thwarts Argentina|date=14 November 2015|publisher=FIFA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116132740/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y%3D2015/m%3D11/news%3Dbrazil-fightback-thwarts-argentina-2732803.html|archivedate=16 November 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, David Luiz and Thiago Silva were among several experienced players who were not chosen for the [[Copa América Centenario squads#Brazil|squad]] that travelled to the [[Copa América Centenario]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schaerlaeckens|first=Leander|title=Brazil's Copa America Centenario roster looks to be experimental|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-fc-yahoo/brazil-finalizes-copa-america-centenario-roster-224516164.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=Yahoo!|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Brazil vs Germany, in Belo Horizonte 12.jpg|thumb|right|David Luiz [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing his country in the [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7–1]] defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]]]

Although primarily a [[centre back]], David Luiz can also be deployed as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], and has drawn praise for his physical strength, work-rate, technique, and range of distribution as a defender, as well as his personality, composure in possession, and confidence on the ball, which enables him to play the ball out from the back or launch an attack with long balls after winning back possession. A powerful striker of the ball from distance, Luiz has also been known to take and score from long-range free kicks. Although in the past he has been criticised in the media for his inconsistent defensive performances, and for being reckless in his challenges, as well as prone to errors or lapses in concentration, during the 2016–17 season, he showed notable improvements upon his return to Chelsea, when the club's new manager [[Antonio Conte]] decided to deploy him as a [[Sweeper (association football)|ball-playing centre back]] in a three-man back-line in the team's [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]]. Luiz excelled in the new role, while Conte praised the defender for working to improve his composure and concentration, and singled out Luiz as being "crucial" to the team's success, also labelling him as one of the best defenders in the world.&lt;ref name=capture/&gt;&lt;ref name=mistakes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil 2-1 Colombia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conte’s brilliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/may/13/antonio-conte-chelsea-champions-manager|title=Antonio Conte’s brilliance has turned Chelsea’s pop-up team into champions|work=The Guardian|author=Barney Ronay|date=13 May 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/3032491/pochettino-copies-conte-and-tottenham-thwart-costa-as-chelsea-run-ends|title=Pochettino copies Conte, Tottenham thwart Costa to deny Chelsea|publisher=ESPN|author=Thore Haugstad|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conte's tactical shift cures Chelsea"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/10/24/chelseas-man-utd-win-inspired-by-formation-desire-to-put-one-ove/|title=Antonio Conte's tactical shift cures Chelsea from back to front|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 October 2016|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2015-2016/chelsea-laying-claim-to-barcelona-legacy-with-conte-s-masterstroke_sto5942103/story.shtml|title=Chelsea laying claim to Barcelona legacy with Conte's masterstroke|publisher=Eurosport|author=Dan Levene|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/antonio-conte-david-luiz-chelsea-great-challenge-back-three-vs-manchester-united-a7684921.html|title=Antonio Conte saw reinventing David Luiz and overcoming Chelsea criticism as 'great challenge'|publisher=The Independent|author1=Miguel Delaney|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/chelsea/story/3104925/chelsea-never-doubted-david-luizs-quality-as-top-defender-antonio-conte|title=Chelsea never doubted David Luiz's quality as top defender – Antonio Conte|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Liam Twomey|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2011/03/is_luiz_the_new_lucio.html|title=Is Luiz the new Lucio?|department=BBC Sport|author1=Tim Vickery|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz is a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and has named [[Kaká]] as his role model.&lt;ref name=embraces&gt;{{cite web|last=Duarte|first=Fernando|title=David Luiz embraces Chelsea but will never abandon Brazil|date=1 February 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/01/david-luiz-chelsea-brazil|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "My faith gives me the belief that I can go out and perform and improve as a player.

Earlier in his career, David Luiz was likened physically to the Brazilian basketball player [[Anderson Varejão]] by fans in his own country, due to their similar hairstyle.&lt;ref name=embraces/&gt; In England, he was referred to as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' villain [[Sideshow Bob]] by opposition fans, and also in self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Sam|title=Chelsea defender David Luiz claims smirk followed Manchester United fan's 'Sideshow Bob' jibe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-defender-david-luiz-claims-smirk-followed-manchester-united-fans-sideshow-bob-jibe-8605311.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kay|first=Alex|title=EXCLUSIVE: Samba stars Luiz and Cesar (or should that be Sideshow Bob and Buzz?) talk to Sportsmail ahead of England v Brazil|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2273515/David-Luiz-Julio-Cesar-interview-ahead-England-v-Brazil.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Luiz is also a Portuguese citizen, which was acquired during his time at Benfica. Portugal wanted him to represent their [[Portugal national football team|national team]], but he opted to play for his native Brazil instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/01/david-luiz-chelsea-brazil|title=David Luiz embraces Chelsea but will never abandon Brazil|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
