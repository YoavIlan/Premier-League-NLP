'''Ryan Guno Babel''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrɑjɐn ˈbaːbəl}}; born 19 December 1986)&lt;ref name="LFC profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/first-team/player/19-ryan-babel |title=Liverpool F.C. Official profile |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128060918/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/first-team/player/19-ryan-babel |archivedate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. He can play as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] or [[Winger (soccer)|left winger]].

Babel began his career at Ajax in 1998, working his way up through the youth team and into the senior squad. He played three seasons for the first team before he was transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in mid-2007, where under three successive managers he failed to secure a regular first team position. Babel was sold to [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] in January 2011, for a sum around half of that which Liverpool paid for him. His time at Hoffenheim was marred with disciplinary problems with three managers at the club. In the summer of 2012, Babel bought out the remaining final year of his contract, making him a free agent, and re-signed a one-year contract with Ajax. After this season, Babel went on to sign with Turkish club [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]] on 21 June 2013. Babel often was linked to a return to the Premier League during his time in Turkey, before ending rumours by signing for UAE side [[Al Ain FC]] in July 2015.

Babel has been part of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] since 2005, and has represented his country at all youth team levels. He played in two World Cups, 2006 and 2010, reaching the final of the latter.

==Early career==
Babel was born in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Inspired by the local footballing talent, including [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]], Babel played for nearby youth-teams S.V Diemen, then Fortius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelofficial.com/en/biography.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529051821/http://www.babelofficial.com/en/biography.asp |archivedate=29 May 2010 |title=Biography |publisher=Babelofficial.com |accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he attended a youth selection day with [[AFC Ajax]]. He made it through the first selection round, but failed to progress any further.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography |publisher=ryanbabel.nl |url=http://www.ryanbabel.nl/ryanbabel/biografie.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823165051/http://www.ryanbabel.nl/ryanbabel/biografie.html |archivedate=23 August 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2007 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next year Ajax accepted him and he played the 1999–2000 season for their D1 team.&lt;ref name=biography/&gt; After having graduated through the C1, B1 and A1 teams, Babel signed his first professional contract in January 2004.&lt;ref name=biography/&gt;

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Playing as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]], on 1 February 2004, just one and a half months after his 17th birthday, Babel made his first-team debut in Ajax's 4–0 home win over [[ADO Den Haag]] in the [[Eredivisie]].&lt;ref name=ARCHIVES&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=61694 |title=Extension for Ryan Babel |publisher=AFC Ajax |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313203650/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154814/contentid%3D61694 |archivedate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax went on to win the Dutch league title, but Babel didn't feature again that season. Nine months later, on 20 November 2004 Babel scored his first senior goal against [[De Graafschap]] in a 5–0 victory.&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=26825.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165032/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=26825.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |title=Babel rewarding Van Basten's faith |publisher=FIFA |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Babel signed a new contract with Ajax. He started the new season by scoring the winning goal in Ajax's 2–1 defeat of [[PSV Eindhoven]] in the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]]. Babel scored in both legs of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] third qualifying round against [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] as Ajax made it to the group stage. 2005–06 was a tougher season for Babel in general though as he managed only two league goals. He did however continue to feature for the national team, and scored his second goal against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in November. At the end of the season, Babel came on as a second-half [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in Ajax's 2–1 victory over PSV in the [[KNVB Cup]] final.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Babel marked the start of 2006–07 with another Johan Cruyff Shield medal, as Ajax defeated PSV 3–1. Babel was linked with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United]] during the January transfer window of the [[2007 in football (soccer)|2006–07 season]] but no move materialised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/news/article2137748.ece |title=West Ham in for Ljungberg as Arsenal line up Dutch star |last=Burt |first=Jason |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714071255/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/news/article2137748.ece |archivedate=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/2402772/babel-catching-magpies-eye |title=Babel catching Magpies' eye |last=van Leeuwen |first=Gerrit |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the transfer speculation, Babel agreed to a new three-year deal with Ajax on 2 February 2007.&lt;ref name="ARCHIVES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=472023&amp;CPID=9&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=&amp;title=Ajax+star+wowed+by+Wenger |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703085837/http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=472023&amp;CPID=9&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=&amp;title=Ajax+star+wowed+by+Wenger |archivedate=3 July 2007 |title=Ajax star wowed by Wenger |publisher=Sky Sports |date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Babel got another Dutch Cup winners medal as Ajax successfully defended the title. The match against AZ went to a penalty shoot-out, but Babel was substituted off after 120 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/clubs/knvbbeker/archief/knvb_beker_nieuw/ajax_wint_beker_na_thriller |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204033937/http://www.knvb.nl/clubs/knvbbeker/archief/knvb_beker_nieuw/ajax_wint_beker_na_thriller |archivedate=4 February 2010 |title=Ajax win cup in thriller |publisher=Royal Dutch Football Association |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 10 July 2007 it was reported that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] had made a [[pound sterling|£]]14&amp;nbsp;million offer to the Amsterdam club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6285040.stm |title=Liverpool make improved Babel bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July it was reported that Liverpool and Ajax had agreed a fee in the region of £11.5&amp;nbsp;million, and later Liverpool confirmed that Babel would sign a five-year contract on 13 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Eaton |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/babel-to-sign-for-reds-today |title=Babel set to sign on Friday |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=23 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160941/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/babel-to-sign-for-reds-today |archivedate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unveiled on 13 July with [[Yossi Benayoun]]. Babel was handed the number 19 shirt. He made his debut on 17 July against [[Werder Bremen]] in a friendly. He was due to play in the first round of the [[Barclays Asia Trophy 2007]] but had a delay in the granting of international clearance. This was sorted out in time for the final against Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11669/2621711/reds-reach-asia-trophy-final |title=Reds reach Asia Trophy final |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his [[Premier League]] debut in the 2007–08 Premier League curtain raiser against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] away after coming on off the bench. A week later he made his [[Anfield]] debut, coming off the bench against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. On 1 September Babel scored his first goal for Liverpool against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6963702.stm |title=Liverpool 6–0 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Chris |last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored his first Champions League goal for Liverpool on 6 November against [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] after coming on as a substitute. He netted twice in the game and almost completed a hat-trick, with a header from a [[Harry Kewell]] cross, but was denied by the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7076592.stm |title=Liverpool 8–0 Besiktas |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored the fourth and last goal in Liverpool's [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage]] match against [[Olympique de Marseille]], which they needed to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7136346.stm |title=Marseille 0–4 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=John |last=Sinnott}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench in the second leg of the quarter final against Arsenal in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and won a penalty and scored a goal, with Liverpool winning the game 4–2 (5–3 on aggregate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7332209.stm |title=Liverpool 4–2 Arsenal (agg 5–3) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also came on as a substitute against Chelsea in the semi-final and despite scoring a goal, Liverpool lost 3–2 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7368736.stm |title=Chelsea 3–2 Liverpool (4–3) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Sam |last=Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ryan Babel 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Babel before Jamie Carragher's testimonial match in 2010]]

Former Liverpool and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] player [[Kenny Dalglish]] has said that Babel has the ability to terrorise defenders in the Premier League with his pace and trickery with the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/kenny-babel-is-terrifying |title=Kenny: Babel Is Terrifying |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=23 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114541/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/kenny-babel-is-terrifying |archivedate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2008, Babel came off the bench to score the winner for Liverpool in a 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United]], his first goal of the [[Premier League 2008-09|2008–09 season]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/babel-propels-liverpool-to-win-over-manchester-united-1.719115 |title=Babel propels Liverpool to win over Manchester United |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 September 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel scored his second goal of the season in Liverpool's 5–1 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 28 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7788422.stm |title=Newcastle 1–5 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2009, against West Ham, Babel came off the bench for Dirk Kuyt. At this stage the score was 2–2. Babel picked up the ball and did well to beat the full-back and sent in a delightful cross for [[Fernando Torres]] to head home the winner. Babel, who has been criticised in the past for his work rate and attitude, earned praise for his efforts in the West Ham game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N165837090920-0012.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126140048/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N165837090920-0012.htm |archivedate=26 November 2009 |title=Torres: My goal debt to Babel |first=Steve |last=Hunter |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 27 September 2009, Babel scored two goals against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] coming off the bench for Fernando Torres to round up a match which ended 6–1 for Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8270616.stm |title=Liverpool 6–1 Hull |date=26 September 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 November 2009 |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2009, Babel scored the opening goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in a Champions League game, a strike from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw. Former Liverpool player [[Alan Hansen]] called upon Babel to play like he did against Lyon, as he still possessed the ability to be a 'top player'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8338788.stm |title=Lyon 1–1 Liverpool |date=4 November 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 November 2009 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2010, it was reported that Liverpool rejected an £8&amp;nbsp;million offer from [[Birmingham City F.C|Birmingham City]] for Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8443286.stm |title=Birmingham's £8m bid for Liverpool's Ryan Babel denied |date=6 January 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel was then disciplined by manager Benitez, over stating on his Twitter page that he had been dropped for the game against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], and was fined two weeks wages of £120,000. He was frequently linked with a move away from Anfield but Rafael Benitez stated his desire for Babel to stay. On 15 March 2010 he scored against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a 4–1 win. On 1 April 2010, he was [[sent off]] for the first time in his Liverpool career in the 30th minute of the first leg of the [[Europa League]] quarter-final against [[S.L. Benfica]] after an altercation with [[Luisão]]. He scored in Liverpool's 4–0 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at Turf Moor, subsequently relegating Burnley to the Championship.
On 19 August 2010, Babel scored the winner against [[Trabzonspor]] in the [[Europa League]] qualifier first leg, it was his first game of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8924283.stm |title=Liverpool 1 – 0 Trabzonspor |date=19 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 August 2010 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his first match in the Premier League at [[Anfield]] against Aston Villa and scored his first goal in the Premier League with a right-footed volley that beat former Liverpool goalkeeper [[Brad Friedel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Babel gained further notoriety amongst fans when, on [[Transfer window|transfer deadline day]] 31 August 2010, it was reported that the player was travelling by helicopter between Liverpool and an unspecified London location as possible transfer talks with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] were ongoing, and there was speculation about his true destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2010/08/31/2097031/ryan-babel-reveals-on-twitter-im-going-nowhere-after |title=Ryan Babel reveals on Twitter 'I'm going nowhere' after Liverpool accept Tottenham's £5m offer |publisher=Goal.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No transfer actually occurred and the helicopter story may be apocryphal, but the image stuck and the term "Babelcopter" became a metaphor for players with an uncertain destination on future transfer deadline days, with the player himself promoting the use of the [[hashtag]] #BabelCopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anchorfan.com/image/babelcopter-takes-off-again-with-ryan-babel-reckons-adam-may-be-on-his-way-59191.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831054542/http://www.anchorfan.com/image/babelcopter-takes-off-again-with-ryan-babel-reckons-adam-may-be-on-his-way-59191.html |archivedate=31 August 2013 |title='BabelCopter' takes off again, and Ryan Babel reckons Adam may be on h |publisher=Anchorfan |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Premier League players to use Twitter to communicate with fans, in January 2011, Babel posted a [[photoshop]]ped image on Twitter of referee [[Howard Webb]] in a [[Manchester United]] shirt following Liverpool's 1–0 defeat to United in the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. He was subsequently charged by [[The Football Association|the F.A.]] with improper conduct and fined £10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/863846/fa-charges-ryan-babel-for-webb-based-photo-joke?cc=5739 |title=FA charges Babel for Webb tweet |date=10 January 2011 |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, Liverpool agreed a fee believed to be in the region of £7&amp;nbsp;million for Babel from [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8267227/Liverpool-accept-Hoffenheim-bid-for-unsettled-winger-Ryan-Babel.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, [[Kenny Dalglish]] said that Babel would be staying at Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/01/24/2320776/kenny-dalglish-confirms-ryan-babel-is-staying-at-liverpool |title=Kenny Dalglish confirm Ryan Babel is staying at Liverpool |date=24 January 2011 |website=Goal.com |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the next day Babel flew to Germany to finalise the deal to sign with Hoffenheim.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/70077.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1899 Hoffenheim===
On 25 January 2011, it was confirmed that Babel had left Liverpool to join German side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim for a reported fee of £8 million, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8281942/Ryan-Babel-leaves-Liverpool-for-Hoffenheim-two-and-a-half-year-contract.html |title=Ryan Babel leaves Liverpool for Hoffenheim two-and-a-half-year contract |date=25 January 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first competitive match was on 26 January 2011 in the [[DFB-Pokal|DFB Cup]] quarter final match against [[FC Energie Cottbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/311815/statistics.html |title=Energie Cottbus 1 – 0 TSG Hoffenheim |date=26 January 2011 |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his 'left little finger out' celebration, in support of disadvantaged youths in Amsterdam.
On 9 April 2011, Babel scored his first goal for Hoffenheim, in a 3–2 loss to [[SC Freiburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/matches/2010/spieltag-29/124995/sc-freiburg-vs-1899-hoffenheim/spielbericht.php |title=Bundesliga – official website |publisher=Bundesliga |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, Babel netted his first league goal of the season on 20 August 2011 against [[FC Augsburg|Augsburg]] in a 2–0 away win. On 10 September 2011, he scored his first brace for 1899 Hoffenheim in a 4–0 win against [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] and scored again in the next game on 17 September in a 3–1 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

After playing for Hoffenheim for 18 months, scoring six goals in 51 matches, he was released by the club on 31 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8036433/Hoffenheim-release-Babel |title=Hoffenheim release Babel |last=Zocher |first=Thomas |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ajax===
After personally buying off the remaining year of his contract with Hoffenheim, he returned to his old club Ajax on a one-year deal. Wearing shirt number 49, the same number he wore when he made his first ever appearance for the first team at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], he made his debut with Ajax for the 2012–13 season on 15 September 2012, in a regular season match against [[RKC Waalwijk]]. He came on as a substitute for [[Derk Boerrigter]] in the second half, assisting [[Jody Lukoki]] on the second goal in the 2–0 home win for the [[Amsterdam]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/31/soccer-dutch-babel-idINL4E8JV7HG20120831 |title=Soccer-Babel agrees one-year deal with Ajax |agency=Reuters |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal since returning to Ajax in a match against ADO Den Haag on 23 September 2012.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Struggling with a slight injury midway through the season, Babel managed to play a total of 16 league matches for Ajax, scoring four goals in total in the [[Eredivisie]]. He also made four appearances in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]], as well as two more appearances in the [[2012–13 KNVB Cup]], where he scored the second goal in the '15-minute of the second round fixture against [[FC Utrecht]], with the match ending 3–0 for the Amsterdam side prior to his injury. He would return to action after being sidelined to help his side secure their 3rd consecutive national title and 32nd overall.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Kasımpaşa===
Opting not to extend his contract with Ajax in order to make way for the next generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=190237 |title=Babel en Malki voor drie jaar naar ambitieus Kasimpasa |publisher=Voetbalzone |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=12 February 2014 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel decided to join Turkish side [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]] where former Ajax player [[Shota Arveladze]] was the current manager. He was joined in Turkey by fellow Amsterdam born defender [[Ryan Donk]] who made the transfer from Belgian side [[Club Brugge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/242146/Kasimpasa-slaat-slag-met-binnenhalen-Babel-en-Donk.htm |title=Kasimpasa slaat slag met binnenhalen Babel en Donk |publisher=Voetbal International |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2013 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Ain===
Babel signed a contract with [[UAE Arabian Gulf League]] champions [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]] to replace the outgoing [[Miroslav Stoch]]. He signed the contract after passing a medical test on 2 July 2015. In December 2015, Al Ain and Babel were involved in a conflict over Babel's disciplinary issues with the club's hierarchy and regarding his use of social media. The club demoted him to the reserves citing poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/ryan-babel-part-of-al-ain-reserve-team |title=Ryan Babel part of Al Ain 'reserve team' |first=Ashwani |last=Kumar |newspaper=Khaleej Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beşiktaş===
In January 2017, Babel joined [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] on a two-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38492178|title=Ryan Babel: Former Liverpool forward joins Turkish side Besiktas |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2017 |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only joining the club in January, Babel became a crucial member of the squad that season, making 18 [[2016–17 Süper Lig|league]] appearances and scoring 5 goals as he helped Beşiktaş secure their fifteenth league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fall-rise-ryan-babel-how-14464244 |title=The fall and rise of Ryan Babel – how the former Liverpool man has rescued his career |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulham===
On 15 January 2019, Babel signed for Premier League club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a contract until the end of the [[2018–19 Fulham F.C. season|2018–19 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2019/january/15/ryan-babel-signs-for-fulham |title=Babel signs for Fulham  |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=15 January 2019 |accessdate=16 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Babel Oranje.jpg|150px|thumb|Babel playing for the Netherlands in August 2007]]

Babel took part in the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. Babel scored two goals in four games as the Netherlands reached the quarter-finals. There they were defeated by Nigeria, 10–9 in a penalty shoot-out (Babel scored his penalty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/netherlands2005/matches/round=91020300/match=91020047/index.html |title=Nigeria 1–1 Netherlands |publisher=FIFA |date=25 June 2005 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that season, Babel made his international debut on 26 March 2005, away against [[Romanian national football team|Romania]]. He entered the game as a first-half substitute for [[Arjen Robben]] and went on to score the second goal in a 2–0 victory.&lt;ref name=fifa/&gt; The goal made Babel the youngest goalscorer in 68 years for the Netherlands&lt;ref name=fifa/&gt; and the fourth-youngest of all time.&lt;ref name=MARCO/&gt; Babel had been a first team regular with Ajax in 2004–05 and finished with seven league goals in 22 appearances.

In 2006, [[Marco van Basten]] included Babel in the Dutch squad for [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Due to a knee injury however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contacttheplayers.com/profiles/ryan-babel/253.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502025215/http://www.contacttheplayers.com/profiles/ryan-babel/253.html |archivedate=2 May 2010 |title=Ryan Babel |publisher=contacttheplayers |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babel only featured once, as a second-half substitute for [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] in the group match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/germany2006/matches/round=97410100/match=97410037/index.html |title=Netherlands 0–0 Argentina |publisher=FIFA |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Basten has been quoted as saying Babel "has all the potential to become the next [[Thierry Henry]]".&lt;ref name=MARCO&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2183792.ece |title=Gunners ready to snare Babel, 'the new Henry' |last=Burt |first=Jason |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061523/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2183792.ece |archivedate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Babel was part of the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands under-21 team]] competing in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|UEFA Under-21 Championship]], being held in the Netherlands. In the group stage, Babel scored a penalty against Portugal, helping the Dutch to secure a semi-final spot and thus qualifying for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing. His second tournament goal came during his [[man of the match]] performance in the final as the Netherlands defeated [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia]] 4–1 to retain their title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=4/newsid=555143.html |title=Babel pays tribute to best vintage |publisher=UEFA |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629013958/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=4/newsid=555143.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Babel was selected for the Dutch squad which would compete in the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament. On 31 May, it was announced that Babel had been withdrawn from the squad after tearing ankle ligaments in training. Van Basten added then-[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[Khalid Boulahrouz]] to his squad in place of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/netherlands/7429356.stm |title=Injury rules Babel out of Euros |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 May 2008 |date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup===
Babel was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219200542/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg?hl=en |archivedate=19 December 2013 |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager [[Bert van Marwijk]] announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Netherlands reached [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], Babel did not appear in any of the matches during the tournament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Euro 2012===
Babel returned in Oranje after an absence of almost a year on 11 November 2011 as a starter in the pre Euro 2012 0–0 drawn friendly against Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=1715444.html |title=Netherlands draw blank against Switzerland by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com |publisher=UEFA |date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
