'''Sokratis Papastathopoulos''' ({{lang-el|Σωκράτης Παπασταθόπουλος}}, {{IPA-el|soˈkratis papastaˈθopulos|pron}}; born 9 June 1988), commonly known by the singular name '''Sokratis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sokratis o Papastathopoulos? Questo è il dilemma |url=http://www.milannews.it/?action=read&amp;idnotizia=31205 |first=Francesco |last=Somma |website=milannews.it |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Greek professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]].

==Club career==
===AEK Athens===
Papastathopoulos joined AEK Athens from &lt;!--Red link [[Apollon Petalidiou]]--&gt;Apollon Petalidiou after being scouted by [[Toni Savevski]]. On 26 October 2005, he made his debut for AEK in a [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] match against [[PAS Giannina F.C.|PAS Giannina]], scoring in the seventh minute of the game to help lead AEK to a 3–0 win.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Niki Volou (loan)====
In January 2006, he was loaned to [[Second Division (Greece)|Greek Second Division]] club [[Niki Volos F.C.|Niki Volou]] for six months in order to gain first-team football and gather valuable experience. He made a total of 15 appearances for Niki Volou.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====AEK Athens return====
During the [[2006-07 Superleague Greece]], Papastathopoulos managed to make 14 appearances whilst competing against the likes of [[Bruno Cirillo]], [[Traianos Dellas]] and [[Vangelis Moras]]. In AEK Athens' [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League]] campaign, Papastathopoulos managed to play in three out of six group games. In these three games, AEK managed one win (the famous 1–0 victory over [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], where he man-marked [[Filippo Inzaghi]]), one draw (the 2–2 away draw with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]) and one loss (the 3–1 away defeat to [[Lille OSC|Lille]]). During the [[2007–08 Superleague Greece]], he was a mainstay in AEK's defence, keeping out competition from [[Geraldo Alves (footballer, born 1980)|Geraldo Alves]]. He also played in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08 Champions League]] campaign, and in a Superleague match, he became AEK's youngest-ever captain, at age 19, in a game against local [[Athens]] rivals [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Genoa===
On 1 August 2008, Papastathopoulos agreed to transfer to [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] of the Italian [[Serie A]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4314|script-title=el:Ανακοίνωση|trans-title=Communication|date= 1 August 2008|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=AEK Athens F.C. |language=Greek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805100628/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=74&amp;n_id=4314|archivedate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a club friendly against Genoa on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.genoacfc.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5291&amp;Itemid=31|title=IL GENOA DA' LEZIONE DI GRECO|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=Genoa C.F.C. |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut for Genoa on 27 September 2008 against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], followed by a start against [[Ravenna Calcio|Ravenna]] in the [[Coppa Italia]] a few days later. His first goal for Genoa came on 5 October 2008 at home against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. Genoa won the game 3–2, but Papastathopoulos was sent off in the 89th minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/soccer/report?gameId=251286|title=Genoa vs. Napoli – Football Match Report – October 5, 2008 |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251286&amp;&amp;cc=5739 | title = Genoa 3–2 Napoli |website=ESPN Soccernet | date = 5 October 2008 | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], he managed to play in most games and became somewhat of a fan favourite.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Milan===
On 20 July 2010, it was confirmed on [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]'s website that Papastathopoulos had joined the team, after Genoa and Milan reached an agreement to transfer Papastathopoulos to the club for €14&amp;nbsp;million, with the following payment schedule: [[Gianmarco Zigoni]] (half of his registration rights, valued at €3.75&amp;nbsp;million), [[Nnamdi Oduamadi]] (half of his rights, valued at €3.5&amp;nbsp;million) and [[Rodney Strasser]] (half of his rights, valued at €2.25&amp;nbsp;million) in a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership deal]], plus €4.5&amp;nbsp;million in funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome Sokratis! |url=http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail.aspx?idNews=124929 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724033155/http://www.acmilan.com/NewsDetail.aspx?idNews=124929 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |publisher=A.C.

====Genoa return====
On 24 May 2011, Milan and Genoa executives [[Adriano Galliani]] and [[Enrico Preziosi]], respectively, formed a verbal agreement to solve the player ownerships (subject to player agreements) of [[Kevin-Prince Boateng]], [[Alberto Paloschi]], [[Marco Amelia]] and [[Giacomo Beretta]]. The deal entailed that Milan bought back Gianmarco Zigoni, Rodney Strasser and Nnamdi Oduamadi (all under original price),&lt;ref name=Genoa2011bilancio/&gt; while Genoa bought back Papastathopoulos for €13&amp;nbsp;million, which effectively made the ''de facto'' loan cost for Milan €1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Genoa2011bilancio&gt;{{cite book|title= Genoa CFC SpA Report and Accounts on 31 December 2011  | date =  April 2012|publisher= registroimprese.it/ CCIAA Archive | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acmilan.com/uploads/club/bilancio2011/ | title = Relazione e Bilancio al 31 Dicembre 2011 | language = Italian | publisher = Ac milan | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2011/maggio/25/Boateng_del_Milan_Riscatto_milioni_ga_10_110525107.shtml|title=Boateng e del Milan Riscatto da 7 milioni|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Werder Bremen===
[[File:Sokratis Papastathopoulos 2012.JPG|thumb|upright|Papastathopoulos with [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in 2012]]

On 21 July 2011, Papastathopoulos moved to German club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] on a loan deal until the end of the [[2011–12 SV Werder Bremen season|2011–12 season]], with the option to purchase outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.werder.de/en/aktuell/news/34406.php|title=Sokratis introduced|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=SV Werder Bremen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518171636/http://www.werder.de/en/aktuell/news/34406.php|archivedate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2011/07/21/2584535/official-sokratis-papastathopoulos-joins-werder-bremen-on|title=Official: Sokratis Papastathopoulos joins Werder Bremen on loan from Genoa|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/936169/werder-bremen-swoop-for-papastathopoulos-on-loan-from-genoa?cc=3888|title=Bremen swoop for Papastathopoulos|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2013|website=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following impressive performances on loan, on 16 April 2012, it was announced that Papastathopoulos would join Bremen on a permanent basis for a €5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1615865.html|title=Papastathopoulos makes Bremen move permanent|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/04/16/papastathopoulos-completes-bremen-switch/|title=Papastathopoulos completes Bremen switch|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=16 January 2013|publisher=Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Genoa CFC SpA Report and Accounts on 31 December 2012 |publisher= registroimprese.it/ CCIAA Archive | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2012–13 SV Werder Bremen season|2012–13 season]], however, was not a good one for the club. In March 2013, in the midst of a relegation battle and with tensions high, Papastathopoulos engaged in a training ground brawl with teammate [[Marko Arnautović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/29/werder-bremen-stars-show-strain-of-relegation-battle-with-petulant-training-ground-brawl-3565176/|title=Werder Bremen stars show strain of relegation battle with petulant training ground brawl|date=29 March 2013|newspaper=Metro|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremen would ultimately finish the year in 14th, staving-off relegation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Borussia Dortmund===
On 24 May 2013, the eve of the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final|2013 Champions League Final]] between [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]], Papastathopoulos completed a €9.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer to Dortmund, agreeing to a five-year contract through to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvb.de/?%87%ECY%1B%E7%F4%9C%5Ch%E2%81%99 | title = BVB sign "Sokratis" | publisher = Borussia Dortmund | date = 28 May 2013 | accessdate = 28 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/upegrapse-sti-ntortmoud-o-swkratis/677300 | title = Υπέγραψε στην Ντόρτμουντ ο Σωκράτης! | publisher = sport-fm.gr| date = 23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvs.org/sokratis-papastathopoulos-vs-msakni/|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos vs Msakni – Football VS – Real football face to face|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing, he spoke about the deal, saying, "Money did not play a role in my decision to join Dortmund. My own future was all that mattered and I am convinced that I made the right decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4016/main/2013/06/05/4027048/sokratis-i-did-not-join-dortmund-for-the-money|title=Sokratis: I did not join Dortmund for the money |website=Goal.com | date = 5 June 2013 | accessdate = 28 July 2013 | first = Stefan | last = Coerts}}&lt;/ref&gt; With centre-back [[Felipe Santana]] departing Dortmund for [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], Papastathopoulos began as the effective third-choice behind tandem [[Neven Subotić]] and [[Mats Hummels]]. Borussia Dortmund Sporting Director [[Michael Zorc]] expressed his satisfaction with the deal: "We are delighted that Sokratis has decided to join Borussia Dortmund. He is a flexible player capable to play in a variety of positions in defence who we believe has tremendous potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/borussia-dortmund/transfer-talk/news/papastathopoulos-joins-dortmund_86480.html|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos joins Borussia Dortmund | publisher = sportsmole.co.uk| date = 28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2013, Papastathopoulos made his debut for Dortmund in a pre-season friendly away to Swiss club [[FC Basel|Basel]] at [[St. Jakob-Park]], along with fellow BVB debutants [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] and [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]]. On 27 July, he won his first title with the club after entering the match as a substitute in a 4–2 win over Bayern Munich for the [[2013 DFL-Supercup|2013]] [[DFL-Supercup]].&lt;ref name=goaldotcom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thefinalball.com/jogo.php?id=2821403|title=DFL SuperCup Final 2013| publisher = footballzz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2013, he scored his first goal for Dortmund in a 6–1 win over [[VfB Stuttgart]] in the [[Bundesliga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2013/0000276334.php|title=Lewandowski shines as Stuttgart hit for six|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105001353/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2013/0000276334.php|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papastathopoulos' strong first year with Dortmund was rewarded with his selection to the best XI of the [[2013–14 Bundesliga]] campaign. The selection was organized in a worldwide fan vote by the governing body of the Bundesliga through its official website. The description of his play following his nomination was, "The definition of defense falls on him. The Greek stopper took advantage of the opportunities given to him by the absence of Neven Subotić and Mats Hummels. Stable, with leadership characteristics and tendency to win the ball without making easily a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.protothema.gr/sports/article/374148/stin-kaluteri-11ada-tou-germanikou-protathlimatos-o-sokratis-papastathopoulos/|title=Στην καλύτερη 11άδα του Γερμανικού Πρωταθλήματος ο Σωκράτης Παπασταθόπουλος| publisher = protothema.gr | date = 28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/fanzone/team-of-the-season/|title=Team of the season|publisher=Bundesliga|date=23 April 2014|access-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412230941/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/fanzone/team-of-the-season/|archive-date=12 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Papastathopoulos was ruled out of action for two weeks with a broken fibula. He suffered the injury to his right leg in Dortmund's 1–0 win over [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], a result that ended a five-match Bundesliga losing streak for the club.

In the summer of 2015, Papastathopoulos was linked with moves to various English [[Premier League]] clubs as Dortmund prepared for a new start following long-time manager [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s departure. Dortmund Sporting Director [[Michael Zorc]], however, said Papastathopoulos would still have a part to play for BVB in new manager [[Thomas Tuchel]]'s debut season with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pulse.ng/sports/football/borussia-dortmund-michael-zorc-quells-rumours-over-sokratis-papastathopoulos-and-sven-bender-id3890196.html|title=MIchael Zorc quells rumours over Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Sven Bender| publisher = pulse.ng| date = 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2015, Papastathopoulos extended his contract with Borussia Dortmund until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/725/bundesliga/2015/10/26/16696102/sokratis-extends-dortmund-contract|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos extends Borussia Dortmund contract |website=Goal.com |date=26 October 2015|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2015, Papastathopoulos scored his first goal in the [[2015–16 Bundesliga]] in an eventual 2–1 away loss to [[1.

On 22 February 2016, Papastathopoulos missed the second leg of the [[UEFA Europa League]] round-of-32 tie against [[FC Porto]] and the Bundesliga clash with [[Bayern Munich]] due to an adductor injury, as tests confirmed that the 27-year-old would be out for up to three weeks. The Greek centre back picked up the injury during Dortmund's 1–0 win against [[Bayer Leverkusen]] and was replaced 13 minutes from time at the BayArena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccernews.com/injured-sokratis-to-miss-key-dortmund-clashes/194061/|title=Injured Sokratis to miss key Dortmund clashes – Soccer News|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/bundesliga/news/detail/item130089/papastathopoulos-to-miss-crucial-bvb-ties/|title=Papastathopoulos to miss crucial BVB ties – Fox Sports|date=23 February 2016|accessdate=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409002015/http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/bundesliga/news/detail/item130089/papastathopoulos-to-miss-crucial-bvb-ties/|archive-date=9 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2016, Papastathopoulos featured in his third [[DFB-Pokal]] in a row, putting in a tremendous performance despite a missed penalty, but he did not succeed in winning the DFB-Pokal for first time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/Germany/ntamplouxos-sta-penalti-h-mpagern.4071385.html|title=Νταμπλούχος στα πέναλτι η Μπάγερν|publisher=sport24.gr|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started the [[2016-17 Bundesliga|2016–17 season]] as the undisputed leader in BVB defence. On 15 September 2016, he netted the second goal in an away crashing 6–0 against [[Legia Warsaw]] on a Group [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2017/matches/round=2000783/match=2019293/postmatch/report/index.html?rss=2400199%20Dortmund%20six-shooters%20wreck%20Legia's%20comeback|title=UEFA Champions League – Legia-Dortmund – Dortmund six-shooters wreck Legia's comeback – UEFA|last=UEFA.com|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2017 the German magazine ''"Kicker"'' listed the Greek international as one of the best players in the German [[Bundesliga]]. The magazine paid a tribute to the best players currently playing in the German Bundesliga, separating them out into different categories. In the first category (World Class) no defenders were listed, however, Papastathopoulos was one of three defenders listed in the second category, International Class. The other two defenders included [[Mats Hummels]] of Bayern Munich and [[Jonathan Tah]] of Bayer Leverkusen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/EllinesExoterikou/nea-diakrish-gia-papastathopoylo.4462277.html |title=Νέα διάκριση για Παπασταθόπουλο  |publisher=sport24.gr |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sokratis170727.jpg|thumb|right|Papastathopoulos (right) training with [[Borussia Dortmund]] in 2017]]

On 8 February 2017, in a [[DFB Pokal]] home win on penalties' game against [[Hertha BSC|Hertha Berlin]], Papastathopoulos' two quickfire (in a minute) bookings for dissent saw Dortmund finish extra time with 10 men before [[Fabian Lustenberger]], [[Vladimir Darida]] and [[Salomon Kalou]] all erred from the spot, rendering [[Christian Pulisic]]'s miss irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/german-dfb-pokal/story/3056496/borussia-dortmund-reach-pokal-quarters-after-shootout-with-hertha-schalke-win |title=Dortmund reach Pokal quarters after shootout with Hertha; Schalke win |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2017, Dortmund made three changes from last weekend's 3–0 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg]] and it was two of those, Papastathopoulos and [[Raphael Guerreiro]], who combined to open the scoring in the 13th minute in a 3–0 away win against [[SC Freiburg]]. Papastathopoulos looked to be offside as Guerreiro swung in a free-kick from the right, which the Greece defender met with a header planted inside the right-hand post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/1051478/kollise-o-sokratis-vid |title=Το κόλλησε ο Σωκράτης  |publisher=gazzetta.gr |accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2016-17/22/3317450/spielbericht_sc-freiburg-7_borussia-dortmund-17.html |title=Freiburg vs Dortmund 0–3  |publisher=kicker.de |accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 16 April 2017, Papastathopoulos was the one who had a quick reaction to a [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] equalizing, by scoring a goal after [[Sven Bender]]'s assist giving a lead to the score in his team in a final 3–1 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2016-17/29/3317506/spielbericht_borussia-dortmund-17_eintracht-frankfurt-32.html |title=Dortmund vs Eintracht 3–1  |publisher=kicker.de |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2017, Papastathopoulos reached 100 appearances with Dortmund in [[Bundesliga]] in a home game against [[SV Werder Bremen]] and secured automatic qualification to the group stage of next season's [[UEFA Champions League]]. On 27 May 2017, in his fourth [[DFB-Pokal]] in a row, Borussia Dortmund claimed a first DFB-Pokal win since 2012 as [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]]'s penalty defeated [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearthewall.com/2017/5/27/15705332/dfb-pokal-match-report-dortmund-wins-a-title |title=DFB Pokal Match Report: Dortmund wins a title |publisher=fearthewall.com |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/sport/dortmund-pokalsieger-101.html |title=Borussia Dortmund gewinnt DFB-Pokal |publisher=tagesschau.de |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2017, as the captain of the club, he lost the [[2017 DFL-Supercup]] on penalties' game against [[Bayern Munich]]. On 17 September 2017, he scored at the end of the first half against [[1. FC Köln]], giving a lead of two goals in his club. It was his first goal for the [[2017-18 Bundesliga|2017–18 season]] and was secured with the use of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/EllinesExoterikou/gkol-toy-papastathopoyloy-kontra-sthn-kolwnia-me-xrhsh-toy-var.4850517.html |title=Γκολ του Παπασταθόπουλου κόντρα στην Κολωνία με χρήση του VAR! |publisher=sport24.gr |accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2017, Borussia Dortmund's unbeaten start to the season was ended by [[RB Leipzig]]'s 3–2 away win, as the Greek defender initially in trying to push the ball away helped Leipzig winger [[Yussuf Poulsen]] to score, while at the beginning of second half, was sent off for a foul in the box and [[Jean-Kevin Augustin]] scored the penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Columns/contra-epithesi/dortmund/me-gkafa-papastathopoyloy-anatroph-h-leipsia.4891149.html |title=Με γκάφα Παπασταθόπουλου ανατροπή η Λειψία |publisher=contra.gr |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 2017, after losing its [[UEFA Champions League]] opening games in Group H to [[Tottenham]] and [[Real Madrid]], Dortmund needed a win to kick-start its campaign in Europe's premier club competition, but they succeeded only to seal an away draw against Cypriot champions [[APOEL]], as the Greek defender equalized with a header to [[Mario Götze]]'s cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2017/10/17/39500952/apoel-1-borussia-dortmund-1-sokratis-header-spares-burkis |title=APOEL vs Borussia Dortmund 1–1 |website=Goal.com |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/champions-league-roundup-apoel-borussia-dortmund-draw |title=Champions League roundup: Borussia Dortmund held to draw by Apoel |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2017, in the derby against rivals [[Bayern Munich]] he suffered a leg injury, during the first half, and was substituted by [[Jeremy Toljan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/traymatisthke-o-papastathopoylos-agwnia-gia-thn-ethnikh-elladas.4922818.html |title=Τραυματίστηκε ο Παπασταθόπουλος, αγωνία για την Εθνική Ελλάδας |publisher=sport24.gr |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two weeks later in an away game against [[VfB Stuttgart]] has received a heavy blow and replaced at the end of the first half from [[Dan-Axel Zagadou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/as-it-happened-stuttgart-2-1-borussia-dortmund/a-41430252 |title=As it happened: Stuttgart 2–1 Borussia Dortmund |publisher=dw.com |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
On 2 July 2018, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] announced that Papastathopoulos has agreed a long-term contract with the club for a reported fee £17.6 million and will wear the number 5 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/sokratis-papastathopoulos-signs|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos signs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2778354-sokratis-papastathopoulos-completes-arsenal-transfer-for-reported-176m-fee|title=Sokratis Papastathopoulos Completes Arsenal Transfer for Reported £17.6M Fee}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 2018, he made his official debut with the club as a starter, at [[Emirates Stadium|Emirates]] in a 2–0 loss against champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. On 4 October 2018, Papastathopoulos scored his first for the club, setting the Gunners on their way to a comfortable 3–0 victory over [[Qarabag]] in the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage]]. After just four minutes of play in Baku, the centre-back was left unmarked inside the opposing penalty area, deflecting the ball home after the initial header fell into his path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/qarabag-vs-arsenal/401956|title=Qarabag FK 0–3 Arsenal: Trio score first goals as Gunners cruise in Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papastathopoulos, was named to the UEFA Europa League Team of the Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2573295.html |title=Who makes our Europa League Team of the Week?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 October 2018, Papastathopoulos was forced off during Greece’s 2–0 defeat to [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and was believed to have sprained his ankle. Papastathopoulos was at the heart of Unai Emery’s defence since the Spaniard took over the reins in the summer and a fixture in a winning run of nine matches.

The goal sealed a 3–0 home win for Arsenal, sending them through to the round of 32 in the [[2018-19 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47303991 |title=Arsenal vs BATE Borisov 3-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20130814 AT-GR Sokratis Papastathopoulos 2368.jpg|thumb|upright|Papastathopoulos playing for [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in 2013]]

Papastathopoulos was called up for the [[Greece national football team|Greek senior team]] on 1 February 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=652323.html |title=Greece Squad call up |publisher=UEFA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202071137/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D652323.html |archivedate=2 February 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut on 5 February 2008 in the 1–0 friendly victory against the [[Czech national football team|Czech Republic]]. The Greece squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] was announced by [[Otto Rehhagel]] on 27 May 2008, and Papastathopoulos was the unfortunate player to be cut from the provisional squad of 24 to the final 23-man selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=702185.html | title = Greece's Papastathopoulos drops out | publisher = UEFA | date = 28 May 2008 | accessdate = 2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papastathopoulos became the first player to be sent off at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] during the opening game of the tournament against co-hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] after receiving two yellow cards, following what pundits decried as two poor decisions by referee [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glendenning|first=Barry|title=Euro 2012: Poland 1–1 Greece – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/08/euro-2012-poland-greece-live|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Papastathopoulos was named to Greece's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/greece/10810255/Greece-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Greece World Cup 2014 squad|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=30 June 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started in each of the team's group matches, helping them to a [[clean sheet]] against [[Japan national football team|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285183|title=Japan 0–0 Greece|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=30 June 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|round of 16]], Papastathopoulos scored his first international goal, equalising in second half stoppage time against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. However, the Greeks were eventually defeated 5–3 in a [[penalty shootout]] by the [[2013 Copa Centroamericana|Central American champions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27961189|title=Costa Rica 1–1 Greece|accessdate=30 June 2014|date=29 June 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
