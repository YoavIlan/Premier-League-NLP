==Early life==
Karius was born in [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach]], Baden-Württemberg on 22 June 1993 to Christine and Harald Karius.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/home_artikel,-_arid,2795603.html|title=15-Jähriger Biberacher hält künftig Robinhos Schüsse|author=Staff writer(s)|website=Schwäbische Zeitung das Onlineportal|language=German|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harald intended for his son to become a [[motocross]] rider, but Loris' grandfather, Karl, encouraged him to focus on football.&lt;ref name=goalinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/11/09/29350962/introducing-loris-karius-how-the-goalkeeper-kicked-past-his|title=Introducing Loris Karius: How the goalkeeper kicked past his struggles to become Liverpool’s No.1|first=Melissa|last=Reddy|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=10 November 2016|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karius attended [[Pestalozzi-Gymnasium Biberach]] until his move to England in 2009 where he was then privately tutored.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.spox.com/de/sport/fussball/nachwuchs/1103/Artikel/loris-karius-vfb-stuttgart-manchester-city-jerome-boateng.html|title=Der Werdegang von Loris Karius bei Manchester City|author=Staff writer(s)|website=Spox|language=German|date=17 March 2011|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Karius played for local team SG Mettenberg and [[SSV Ulm 1846]] before joining [[VfB Stuttgart]], where he rose through the youth ranks and appeared for the German under-16 national team against Macedonia in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/mediathek_galid,205691_titel,-Fussballprofi-Loris-Karius-in-der-Heimat-_toid,157.html|title=Fußballprofi Loris Karius in der Heimat|author=Staff writer(s)|website=Schwäbische Zeitung das Onlineportal|language=German|date=27 March 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] invited Karius and his family to England after watching him in Germany's under-16 game against Azerbaijan, and completed his signing on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/632981|title=Stuttgart hit out at City over young goalkeeper|author=Staff writer(s)|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karius played for the under-18 and the under-21 Manchester City teams, but failed to make a senior appearance during his time in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/09/loris-karius-delighted-finally-get-game-former-club-man-city|title=Loris Karius delighted to finally get a game at former club Man City|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/champions-league/loris-karius-out-to-prove-manchester-city-wrong-1.3455598|title=Loris Karius out to prove Manchester City wrong|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainz 05===
[[File:Loris-Karius-2015-07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Karius with [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] in 2015]]

Manchester City loaned Karius to [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] in August 2011, where he played for Mainz 05's reserve team, [[1. FSV Mainz 05 II|Mainz 05 II]], in the [[Regionalliga]]. On 11 January 2012, the move was made permanent with Karius committing himself to a two-year deal with an option for a third year that would extend his contract to June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/563095/artikel_bis-2014_05-bindet-karius.html|title=Bis 2014: 05 bindet Karius|author=Staff writer(s)|publisher=''[[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]]''|language=German|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his Mainz 05 debut on 1 December 2012 in a [[Bundesliga]] match against [[Hannover 96]] when he was substituted for [[Shawn Parker]] after goalkeeper [[Christian Wetklo]] had been sent off, which, aged 19 years, 5 months and 9 days old, made Karius the youngest goalkeeper ever to play in the Bundesliga.&lt;ref name=goalinterview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/mainz-05-vs-hannover-96/1300903/lineups|title=Mainz 05 vs Hannover 96 Match Report|author=Staff writer(s)|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=1 December 2012|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no further appearances in the 2012–13 season, but established himself as first-choice goalkeeper in the 2013–14 season and on 12 January 2015 signed a three-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/loris-karius-verlaengert-bei-mainz-05.jsp|title=Loris Karius verlängert beim 1.

Karius was ever-present in the [[2015–16 1. FSV Mainz 05 season|2015–16 season]], keeping nine clean sheets, saving two penalties and being voted the second-best goalkeeper in the league in a poll of 235 fellow Bundesliga players, ranking behind only [[Manuel Neuer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/noblmd32-bundesliga-your-team-of-the-season-goalkeepers.jsp|title=Team of the Season: Neuer sweeps the board in goalkeeper vote|author=Staff writer(s)|publisher=[[Bundesliga]]|date=6 May 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-bound-loris-karius-voted-11376318|title=Liverpool-bound Loris Karius voted second-best Bundesliga goalkeeper|first=Kristian|last=Walsh|publisher=''[[Liverpool Echo]]''|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding this decision, Klopp stated he wanted to take Karius "out the firing line," and that "Karius is a young goalkeeper. He will bounce back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp backs keeper for future success|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38324774|author=Staff writer(s)|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2017–18 season ====
In the 2018 Champions League quarter-final 2nd leg at [[Manchester City]], with the aggregate scoreline at 3–1 to Liverpool Karius was involved in a controversial incident when he failed to clear a cross into the penalty area, punching the ball downward which ricocheted off teammate James Milner and into the path of Man City striker [[Gabriel Jesus]] who scored, only for the linesman to incorrectly give offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City 1–2 (agg. 1–5) Liverpool: Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino stun Blues to advance to Champions League semi-finals – 5 talking points |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-city-1-2-agg-12338906 |access-date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror]] |last=Rathborn |first=Jack |date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Champions League semi-final home leg against [[AS Roma]], with the scoreline at 0–0 Karius let [[Aleksandar Kolarov]]’s shot go through his hands with the ball then hitting the crossbar, before Liverpool went on to win 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool 5–2 Roma: Win unlike any football I've seen before – Lawrenson |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43888382 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=25 April 2018 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=13 July 2018 |last=Lawrenson |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the away game in Rome, Karius was involved in controversy when he came rushing out of his goal and brought down [[Edin Dzeko]] inside the penalty area, but instead of a penalty and red card the linesman gave offside in what ''The Telegraph'' called “an extremely tight call”.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Minutes later Karius parried a Roma shot into the path of Dzeko who made the scoreline 2–1 to Roma, before the game finished 4–2 to Roma and 7–6 to Liverpool on aggregate.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool ride their luck in Rome but survive to reach eighth European Cup final |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/05/02/roma-vs-liverpool-champions-league-live-score-updates/ |access-date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Burt |first=Jason |date=3 May 2018 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karius started for Liverpool against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final]] which Liverpool lost 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44258022|title=Real Madrid 3–1 Liverpool|date=2018-05-26|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deemed at fault for two of the goals, the first and third; the first after his throw was blocked by [[Karim Benzema]] and deflected into the net, and the second after he mishandled [[Gareth Bale]]'s 40-yard strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-stand-loris-karius-despite-14711508 |title=Liverpool will stand by Loris Karius despite Champions League horror show |publisher=Liverpool Echo |author=Ian Doyle |date=27 May 2018 |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match, he wept and tearfully apologised to Liverpool fans who remained in the stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/26/loris-karius-gives-tearful-apology-liverpool-fans-mistakes-real-madrid-7580859/ |title=Loris Karius gives tearful apology to Liverpool fans after mistakes against Real Madrid |publisher=Metro |author=Chris Dawie |date=26 May 2018 |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that his mistakes "lost the team the final".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Loris Karius apologises to Liverpool for Champions League horror show: 'my mistakes lost us the final' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/loris-karius-liverpool-champions-league-mistakes-real-madrid-final-mohamed-salah-sergio-ramos-a8371136.html |work=The Independent |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Karius received online [[death threats]], mainly on [[Twitter]], which prompted [[Merseyside Police]] to launch an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius sent death threats by fans after howlers during Champions League final |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/liverpool-goalkeeper-loris-karius-sent-death-threats-by-fans-after-howlers-during-champions-league-a3849211.html |publisher=Standard.co.uk |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2018 |title=Loris Karius: Liverpool goalkeeper receives death threats after howlers|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/loris-karius-liverpool-death-threats/|publisher=The South African |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Karius underwent an examination at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Medics concluded he had suffered a concussion from an elbow to his head, reportedly from [[Sergio Ramos]] just minutes before his first mistake. Doctors, however, did not pinpoint the exact moment he was concussed. According to doctor [[Ross Zafonte]], it was possible the concussion affected his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zafonte |first1=Ross |last2=Herget |first2=Lenore |title=Statement regarding Loris Karius From Dr. Ross Zafonte and Lenore Herget, PT, DPT |url=https://www.massgeneral.org/News/newsarticle.aspx?id=6792 |publisher=[[Massachusetts General Hospital]] |accessdate=4 June 2018 |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Loris Karius: Liverpool keeper concussed during Champions League final – doctors |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44363648 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on 6 July, at the start of pre season, Klopp stated that Karius was "100% influenced by his concussion", leading to his errors, with Klopp saying "We don't use it as an excuse, we use it as an explanation. For me, it's 100% the explanation [for his performance]. He was influenced by that knock – that is 100%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jurgen-klopp-says-loris-karius-12862355|title=Klopp opens up on Karius Champions League final concussion for the first time|last=Jones|first=Mark|date=2018-07-06|work=mirror|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44735514|title=Loris Karius: Liverpool keeper influenced by Champions League final concussion – Jurgen Klopp|date=2018-07-06|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/306090-jurgen-klopp-loris-karius-concussion|title=Jürgen Klopp speaks on Loris Karius concussion|work=Liverpool FC|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2018–19 season ====
Karius’s handling was back in the spotlight in July 2018 during pre season with Liverpool.&lt;ref name="Errors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt; In the warm-up to Liverpool’s pre-season opener against [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], footage showed Karius spilling the ball into his own net.&lt;ref name="Errors"/&gt; Against [[Tranmere Rovers]] on 10 July, he fumbled a free-kick which directly led to a goal.&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;{{cite news |title=Klopp rallies behind Karius after pre-season blunder |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/0710/977810-klopp-rallies-behind-karius-after-pre-season-blunder/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |agency=RTE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days later Liverpool broke the world transfer fee record for a goalkeeper when they signed [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]] for an initial fee of €62.5 million (£56m), which could rise to €72 million (£66.8 million) with performance-based bonuses, and relegated Karius to a back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-confirm-signing-alisson-becker-14930903 |title=Liverpool confirm signing of Alisson Becker in world record deal |author=Pearce, James |publisher=Liverpool Echo |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720022616/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-confirm-signing-alisson-becker-14930903 |archive-date=20 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Against [[Borussia Dortmund]] on 22 July, Karius came rushing out of his box but his scuffed clearance fell straight into the path of [[Maximilian Philipp]] who was unable to put the ball into the empty net from 40 yards. He was deemed at fault for Dortmund’s third goal late on when he parried [[Christian Pulisic]]’s shot from close range directly into the path of [[Jacob Bruun Larsen]], who scored.&lt;ref name="Errors"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool fans worry for Loris Karius as he makes a mistake after four minutes against Borussia Dortmund |url= https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/22/liverpool-fans-worry-loris-karius-makes-mistake-four-minutes-borussia-dortmund-7746854/?ito=cbshare |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loan to Beşiktaş ====
On 25 August 2018, Karius joined Turkish club [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] on a two-year loan move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45311332|title=Loris Karius: Liverpool goalkeeper joins Turkey's Besiktas on loan|date=2018-08-25|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool FC"/&gt;
