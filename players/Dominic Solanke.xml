==Style of play==
Solanke primarily plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]], although can also operate as either an [[attacking midfielder]] or a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Former Chelsea striker [[Tore André Flo]] has said that Solanke "works really hard", has "got very good physique" and "a great touch on the ball". He went on to say: "He's quick but often what impresses me the most is when he looks like he's lost the ball, he somehow manages to get out with the ball, no matter how tight the situation is or how difficult it looks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dev |last=Trehan |title=Dominic Solanke backed to succeed at Chelsea by Tore Andre Flo |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/9866785/tore-andre-flo-is-a-fan-of-chelsea-youngster-dominic-solanke |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
