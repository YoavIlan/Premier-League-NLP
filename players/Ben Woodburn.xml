==Club career==

===Liverpool===

====Early career====
Born in [[Nottingham]], Woodburn was raised in [[Tattenhall]], [[Cheshire]] and played both [[cricket]] and football from a young age.&lt;ref name="LFCprofile"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/player/ben-woodburn |title=Ben Woodburn |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seniorcallup"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/16/wales-liverpool-ben-woodburn-call-up-squad-republic-of-ireland|title=Chris Coleman denies trying to tie wonderkid Ben Woodburn to Wales|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Stuart|last=James|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/sport/who-ben-woodburn-tattenhall-teenager-12250932|first=David|last=Triggs|title=Who is Ben Woodburn? The Tattenhall teenager who became a Liverpool FC record-breaker|newspaper=[[Chester Chronicle]]|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|Liverpool's academy]] at under-7 level where he steadily progressed through the youth ranks, leading to former academy director Frank McParland identifying him as one of the brightest prospects at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38154968/who-is-liverpool-record-breaker-ben-woodburn|first=Ben|last=Mundy|title=Who is Liverpool record-breaker Ben Woodburn?|publisher=[[Newsbeat]]|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seniorcallup"/&gt; During his schooling, Liverpool agreed to a request from Woodburn's parents that he should stay at home rather than in [[Rainhill]], which was closer to the academy in [[Kirkby]]. In order to facilitate his development, the club arranged for a driver to transport him every day from training back to his home in Tattenhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/liverpool-vs-leeds-match-report-efl-cup-ben-woodburn-divock-origi-a7446521.html|title=Liverpool vs Leeds match report: Ben Woodburn enjoys night to remember but Garry Monk's men go down fighting|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Simon|last=Hughes|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 15 years old, Woodburn was fast-tracked from Liverpool's under-16s to the under-18s and his rapid development saw him included in Liverpool's "Futures Group", a programme which afforded the club's most talented young players a weekly opportunity to train with then first-team [[Coach (sport)|coach]], Pep Lijnders.&lt;ref name="youth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-liverpool-fc-teenager-ben-10801750|title=Who is Liverpool FC teenager Ben Woodburn?|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=Trinity Mirror|first=James|last=Pearce|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====
Having impressed first-team [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Jürgen Klopp]] during these training sessions, Woodburn was handed his non-competitive debut during the [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]] pre-season in a 1–0 win over [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/2016/07/tranmere-rovers-0-1-liverpool-5-things-learned-pre-season-opener/|title=Tranmere Rovers 0–1 Liverpool: 5 things we learned from the pre-season opener|publisher=This is Anfield|first=Ben|last=Twelves|date=8 July 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench in Liverpool's next match to score one and assist another for [[Roberto Firmino]] in a 5–0 [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] win over [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/categories/english-premier-league/club-friendly-fleetwood-town-0-4-liverpool-13-july-2016/233675|title=Ruthless Reds Crush Fleetwood|work=Soccer Laduma|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodburn then, along with [[Kevin Stewart (footballer)|Kevin Stewart]] and fellow academy graduate [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]], signed his first professional contract with Liverpool on 8 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/242420-trio-commit-long-term-futures-to-lfc-by-signing-new-deals|title=Trio commit long-term futures to LFC by signing new deals|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|first=James|last=Carroll|date=8 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his senior debut for Liverpool on 26 November, coming on as a 92nd-minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Georginio Wijnaldum]] in a 2–0 Premier League victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1617" /&gt; Upon doing so, Woodburn became Liverpool's third-youngest debutant of all time at the age of 17 years and 42 days, and the club's second-youngest-ever in the Premier League, behind [[Jack Robinson (footballer, born 1993)|Jack Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ben-woodburn-becomes-third-youngest-12235324|title=Ben Woodburn becomes the third youngest player in Liverpool's history after making debut against Sunderland|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|first=Paul|last=Gorst|date=26 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he became Liverpool's [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics|youngest-ever goalscorer]] at the age of 17 years and 45 days when he came off the bench to score in an [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] quarter-final win over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], bettering [[Michael Owen]]'s record by 98 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38059968|title=Liverpool 2–0 Leeds United|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Jonathan|last=Jurejko|date=29 November 2016|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/29/liverpool-leeds-united-efl-cup-quarter-final-match-report|title=Ben Woodburn sets record as Liverpool break Leeds to reach EFL Cup last four|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Andy|last=Hunter|date=29 November 2016|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ygs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/245135-stats-liverpool-fc-s-youngest-ever-first-team-goalscorers|title=Liverpool FC's youngest ever first-team goalscorers|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|first=James|last=Carroll|date=29 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his rapid development at Liverpool, both [[Sky Sports]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' named Woodburn as one of the top young players to watch in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10706854/ben-woodburn-among-five-premier-league-youngsters-to-watch-in-2017|title=Ben Woodburn among five Premier League youngsters to watch in 2017|publisher=Sky Sports|last1=Bate|last2=Wright|first1=Adam|first2=Nick|date=28 December 2016|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/rising-stars-10-players-watch-2017|title=Rising stars: 10 players to watch in 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Ames|last2=Miller|first1=Nick|first2=Nick|date=28 December 2016|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2017, he became the then-youngest player to represent the club in the [[FA Cup]] when he started in a 0–0 draw with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.inquirer.net/234430/klopps-decision-field-youngest-ever-side-backfires|title=Klopp's decision to field youngest ever side backfires|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=9 January 2017|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/01/the-club-record-ki-jana-hoever-could-break-klopps-strange-weakness-so-far-in-the-fa-cup/|title=The club record Ki-Jana Hoever could break &amp; Klopp’s strange weakness so far in the FA Cup|publisher=This is Anfield|last=Matchett|first=Karl|date=7 January 2018|accessdate=7 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first start in the league followed on 4 April in a 2–1 away triumph over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which saw him become the third-youngest player to start for Liverpool in the Premier League era behind Owen and [[Jordon Ibe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/firmino-and-coutinho-rescue-liverpool-and-see-off-stoke-for-crucial-win-in-top-four-race-35606539.html|title=Firmino and Coutinho rescue Liverpool and see off Stoke for crucial win in top four race|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|first=Carl|last=Markham|date=8 April 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/850698947232509953|title=3 – At 17 years &amp; 175 days, Ben Woodburn is the 3rd youngest player to start a PL game for @LFC behind Jordon Ibe and Michael Owen.

====2017–18 season====
The following season, Liverpool's academy coach [[Steven Gerrard]] named Woodburn as captain of the under-19 side for the club's [[UEFA Youth League]] campaign, a competition which ran parallel to the season's [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steven-gerrard-making-ben-woodburn-13783203|title=Steven Gerrard on making Ben Woodburn his captain|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=19 October 2017|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made just one senior appearance, as a substitute,&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1718" /&gt; during the first half of the season but signed a new long-term deal with Liverpool in October and was named [[BBC]] Wales Young Sportsman of the Year in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-ben-woodburn-closer-look-14068259|title=Who is Ben Woodburn?

====2018–19 season: Loan to Sheffield United====
On 31 July 2018, Woodburn signed on a season-long [[Loan (sports)|loan]] with [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/309960-ben-woodburn-sheffield-united-loan|title=Ben Woodburn joins Sheffield United on loan|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|last=Carroll|first=James|date=1 August 2018|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club four days later, coming off the bench for [[David McGoldrick]] in a 2–1 loss to Swansea.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1819" /&gt; His first start followed on 14 August in a League Cup tie against [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]] where, with the scores level after regulation time, the match progressed to a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1819" /&gt; Woodburn converted his spot kick but Sheffield United were ultimately defeated after his former Liverpool teammate Kevin Stewart scored the winning penalty for Hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/match-report-sheffield-united-exit-the-carabao-cup-as-hull-city-progress-on-penalties-1-9301308|title=Match Report: Sheffield United exit the Carabao Cup as Hull City progress on penalties|newspaper=The Star|last=Shield|first=James|date=14 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled for game time during the first half of the season, however, compounded by an ankle injury sustained in December and by the mid-way point of the campaign had only made eight appearances for the club.&lt;ref name="Soccerbase1819" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-loanee-ben-woodburn-hit-15561377|title=Liverpool loanee Ben Woodburn hit with another setback in stalled season|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=18 December 2018|accessdate=18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently recalled from his loan by Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-considering-loan-offers-forward-15657090|title=Liverpool considering loan offers for forward Ben Woodburn after disappointing Sheffield United spell|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=10 January 2019|accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return to Anfield, Woodburn was touted for a loan move to [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]] but a deal failed to materialize before the closing of the transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool/ben-woodburn-misses-out-on-liverpool-loan-exit-after-hull-city-talks-break-down-a4054551.html|title=Ben Woodburn misses out on Liverpool loan exit after Hull City talks break down|publisher=The Standard|last=Lynch|first=David|date=31 January 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Prior to making his senior international debut, Woodburn was eligible to represent both Wales, through his maternal grandfather, and [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-ben-woodburn-welsh-english-12253550|title=What makes English-born Ben Woodburn Welsh? The Liverpool FC star's complicated situation fully explained|website=WalesOnline|first=Chris|last=Wathan|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early teens he attended a training camp with the [[English Schools' Football Association#International teams|England schoolboys' team]] and was later offered an under-16 call-up by England in August 2014. He rejected the call-up and chose to remain in the Wales setup at the time.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/27/wilfried-zaha-england-gareth-southgate-ivory-coast|title=Gareth Southgate wanted Wilfried Zaha for England role but was too late|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=27 March 2017|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his club debut with Liverpool in November 2016, it was reported that England remained hopeful of convincing Woodburn to switch his international allegiance despite previously being rebuffed. The possibility was ended in September the following year when he made his senior international debut for Wales in a competitive fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/england-wales-liverpool-ben-woodburn-12249875|title=England hoping Liverpool hero Ben Woodburn will switch international allegiance|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|first=James|last=Pearce|date=29 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/09/02/wales-1-austria-0-liverpools-ben-woodburn-comes-bench-fire-priceless/|title=Wales 1 Austria 0: Liverpool's Ben Woodburn comes off bench to fire priceless debut winner|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|last=Bascombe|first=Chris|date=2 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
Woodburn has played for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] up to U19 level and was first called up to train at one of the nation's regional development centres at [[Dragon Park]] when he was 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ben-woodburn-wales-international-england-10077350|title=Liverpool star Ben Woodburn's 'choice' to play for Wales, NOT England, shows how Welsh football is thriving|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|last=Jones|first=Mark|date=23 March 2017|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played for Wales U15s in two games against Poland in March 2014, scored a [[hat-trick]] for the [[Wales national football team|U16 side]] against [[Northern Ireland national under-16 football team|Northern Ireland]] the following year and then captained the [[Wales national under-17 football team|U17]] team against Greece in 2016.&lt;ref name="youth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faw.cymru/en/news/wales-u16-win-final-development-match/|title=Wales U16 win Final Development Match|publisher=[[Football Association of Wales]]|date=21 April 2015|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he represented the [[Wales national under-19 football team|U19]] side in their [[2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification|UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification]] matches and scored a [[2#In sports|brace]] in a 6–2 win over [[Luxembourg national under-19 football team|Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37997564|title=Ben Woodburn: Liverpool youngster inspired by Gareth Bale &amp; Aaron Ramsey|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
On 16 March 2017, Woodburn was called up by head coach [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] to the Wales senior team for the first time, aged 17, for the nation's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="seniorcallup"/&gt; He remained an unused substitute, however, as Wales played out a 0–0 draw in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vavel.com/en/football/premier-league/liverpool-fc/770023-liverpool-fc-international-round-up-alexander-arnold-nets-a-brace-as-england-u19s-seal-qualification.html|title=Liverpool FC international round-up: Alexander-Arnold nets a brace as England U19s seal qualification|publisher=Vavel|first=Charlie|last=Malam|date=24 March 2017|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut on 2 September, coming on as a second-half substitute for [[Tom Lawrence]] and scoring a 25-yard strike in a 1–0 win against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/40954822 |title=Wales 1–0 Austria |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2017 |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/02/wales-austria-world-cup-2018-qualifiers-match-report|first=Paul|last=MacInnes|title=Ben Woodburn's debut scorcher gives Wales vital victory against Austria|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 September 2017|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he became Wales' second-youngest-ever goalscorer behind [[Gareth Bale]] and kept the nation within reach of qualification. Woodburn featured regularly from the bench towards the back end of the qualification campaign as Wales ultimately fell two points short of a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|play-off]] spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/news/i-wont-sleep-tonight-woodburn-elated-with-debut-screamer-for/1pnpw0obxu1rg1fs4kb3lxmje5|title=Liverpool news: Ben Woodburn 'won't sleep' after stunning goal on debut|publisher=Goal.com|last=Dorman|first=Matt|date=3 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41567439|title=Wales fail to qualify for 2018 World Cup: What next for Chris Coleman's side?|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Pritchard|first=Dafydd|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his first start on 14 November in a 1–1 [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] draw with [[Panama national football team|Panama]].&lt;ref name="Soccerway" /&gt;
