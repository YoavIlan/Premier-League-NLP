==Club career==

===Charlton Athletic===
Lookman joined [[Charlton Athletic]]'s academy in 2014 after signing from Waterloo, a youth football club based in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=114672&amp;headline=Charlton%20keen%20to%20secure%20teenage%20prospect%20Ademola%20Lookman%20to%20new%20contract&amp;sectionIs=sport&amp;searchyear=2015 |title=Charlton keen to secure teenage prospect Ademola Lookman to new contract |first=Richard |last=Cawley |newspaper=South London Press |date=27 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208170257/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=114672&amp;headline=Charlton%20keen%20to%20secure%20teenage%20prospect%20Ademola%20Lookman%20to%20new%20contract&amp;sectionIs=sport&amp;searchyear=2015 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goalscoring record for Charlton's U18 and U21 teams led to him making a rapid ascent through the Charlton academy ranks and he made his first-team debut for the Addicks on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref name=CAFCdebut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3833373 |title=Match report: MK Dons 1–0 Charlton |first=George |last=Jones |publisher=Charlton Athletic F.C. |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015323/https://www.cafc.co.uk/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3833373 |archivedate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–2 defeat at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 5 December 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34951482|title=Brighton 3-2 Charlton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 December 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then followed that up with both Charlton's goals in a 2–2 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers]] ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35036029|title=Charlton 2-2 Bolton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Lookman signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 5 January 2017 for an undisclosed fee, reported as an initial £7.5m potentially rising to £11m with add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/10718733/everton-sign-ademola-lookman-from-charlton-for-7-5m |title=Everton sign Ademola Lookman from Charlton for £7.5m |first=Paul |last=Vinnell |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38520520 |title=Ademola Lookman: Everton sign Charlton forward for £11m |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 January 2017|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club ten days later in a 4–0 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], replacing [[Ross Barkley]] in the 90th minute and scoring the team's fourth goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38545988|title=Everton 4-0 Manchester City |first=Luke |last=Reddy |publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 January 2017|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lookman made his first Euro appearance for Everton in a 1–0 win over [[MFK Ružomberok]] in the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] third qualifying round first leg.&lt;ref name=EuroDebut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40724022 |title=Baines gives Everton Europa lead on Rooney return |date=27 July 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Tom |last=Rostance |accessdate=27 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although manager [[Sam Allardyce]] stated that Lookman would not be leaving on loan in the January 2018 transfer window, he changed his mind, and the club arranged a move to Championship club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], where they hoped he would play regular first-team football. However, the player insisted on an alternative move, and joined [[Bundesliga]] club [[RB Leipzig]] until the end of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-wanted-ademola-lookman-stay-14232472 |title=Everton wanted Ademola Lookman to stay in England with Championship club |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=1 February 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/02/01/everton-boss-sam-allardyce-claims-ademola-lookmans-stubbornness-took-him-rb-leipzig-over-derby |title=Everton boss Sam Allardyce claims Ademola Lookman's 'stubbornness' took him to RB Leipzig over Derby |website=Sports Illustrated |date=1 February 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11231037/ademola-lookman-joins-rb-leipzig-on-loan-from-everton |title=Ademola Lookman joins RB Leipzig on loan from Everton |first=Rory |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 January 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first game with Leipzig, Lookman scored the winning goal in the away game against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] after coming on as a late substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/05/ademola-lookman-slips-slides-from-everton-into-leipzig-affections |title=Ademola Lookman slips and slides from Everton into Leipzig’s affections |first=Andy|last= Brassell |date= 5 February 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Lookman was born in England to parents from Nigeria, and is eligible for the national teams of both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38680392 |title=Nigeria keen on England U20 striker Ademola Lookman |first=Oluwashina |last=Okeleji |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first international call-up when he was named in the [[England national under-19 football team|England U19]] squad for two matches against [[Mexico national under-19 football team|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Veevers |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2016/may/england-under-19s-squad-named-for-mexico-150516 |title=England Under-19s squad named for double-header with Mexico |publisher=The Football Association |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently named in the squad for the [[2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|European U19 Championships]] that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2016/jul/under-19s-euro-squad-named-060716|title=England Under-19s squad named for Euro Finals challenge |first=Nicholas |last=Veeves |publisher=The Football Association |date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, Lookman turned down the opportunity to switch allegiance to Nigeria after an approach from the national coach, [[Gernot Rohr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allnigeriasoccer.com/read_news.php?nid=22250 |title=Everton rising star Lookman turns down chance to represent Nigeria ahead of FIFA U20 World Cup |website=All Nigeria Soccer |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his first call-up for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] for [[2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification|European Championship qualifiers]] against the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands under-21s]] and [[Latvia national under-21 football team|Latvia under-21s]] in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/11003712/ten-u20-world-cup-heroes-given-first-england-u21-call-ups |title=Ten U20 World Cup heroes given first England U21 call-ups |first=Lyall |last=Thomas |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 August 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first match, and set up Everton teammate [[Dominic Calvert-Lewin]] for England's goal in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41130408 |title=Netherlands U21 1–1 England U21 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
