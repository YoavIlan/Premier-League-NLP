'''Joseph William Ralls''' (born 13 October 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] as a [[midfielder]]. After playing at youth level for local teams [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] and [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]], Ralls joined the youth academy at Cardiff City after being spotted by scouts from the club. He made his professional debut for the ''Bluebirds'' in August 2011 before joining [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on a season-long loan deal for the 2013–14 season to gain experience. On his return to Cardiff, Ralls established himself in the first-team and has made over 200 appearances for the club in all competitions.

==Career==
===Cardiff City===
Ralls began his career at [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]],&lt;ref name="firstcontract"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ralls signs professional terms |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2467313,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024913/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2467313%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played one game for the first-team in an Aldershot Senior Cup tie against [[Bagshot F.C.|Bagshot]] at the age of just 15 after a number of senior players were rested, before joining [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]] under-16s.&lt;ref name="Snatched"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Cardiff City snatched starlet Joe Ralls away from Fulham |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-football/2011/08/31/how-cardiff-city-snatched-starlet-joe-ralls-away-from-fulham-91466-29332601/ |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was spotted by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] scouts along with Jordan Carter, a small compensation was paid by Cardiff to sign the two players. He had previously agreed to play in a trial match for [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], although this was postponed before he joined Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt; He also attracted interest from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref name="Lookingback"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ytfc.net/news/article/20140526-greenwhite-ralls-1571713.aspx |title=GREEN &amp; WHITE LOOKING BACK - JOE RALLS |publisher=Yeovil Town F.C. |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Cardiff academy manager [[Neal Ardley]] has stated that he had to convince other staff at the club about Ralls after he declared his intention to offer him a contract.&lt;ref name="Stunned"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neal-ardley-reveals-stunned-response-9830546 |title=Neal Ardley reveals stunned response from Cardiff City coaches when he declared: 'I’m going to sign Joe Ralls' |publisher=WalesOnline |date=10 August 2015 |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his departure from the club, Farnborough youth coach Aidan Whelan commented "We realised from when he first joined us that he has a real talent. He was head and shoulders above players at the same age level".&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt;

After Cardiff were left with a depleted squad due to international call-ups prior to a [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] tie against [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 10 August 2011, manager [[Malky Mackay]] approached Ardley to enquire which players in the academy set-up would be ready to step into the first-team for the match. Ardley recommended Ralls, [[Deji Oshilaja]] and Mamadou Diallo to Mackay and Ralls and Oshilaja were eventually named on the substitutes bench for the match. Mackay later revealed that he knew very little about Ralls prior to his inclusion in the match.&lt;ref name="Snatched"/&gt; Ralls was brought on after 67 minutes in place of [[Andrew Taylor (footballer, born 1986)|Andrew Taylor]] to make his professional debut at the age of 17 as Cardiff went on to win 3–1 in extra-time.&lt;ref name="Cardiffdebut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Oxford Utd 1&amp;nbsp;– 3 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/14383989.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was handed his first start in the second round of the competition against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] 13 days later, playing 81 minutes before being replaced by [[Peter Whittingham]].&lt;ref name="Firststart"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14539104 |title=Cardiff City 5–3 Huddersfield Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His progression into the first-team saw him handed his first professional contract by the club on 30 September 2011, later commenting "It's a fantastic feeling to have signed professionally with a club like Cardiff City".&lt;ref name="firstcontract"/&gt; Ralls made his league debut just 48 hours after signing the contract, being brought on after just 10 minutes of a match against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] following an injury to forward [[Kenny Miller]], scoring a stunning volley for his first senior goal as Cardiff went on to lose 2–1.&lt;ref name="firstgoal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hull 2–1 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15045293.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first league start came on 10 December in a goalless draw at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]],&lt;ref name="Leaguedebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16015832 |title=Millwall 0–0 Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to finish his first season in the first-team squad having made 14 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref name="Games played by Joe Ralls in 2011/2012"&gt;{{Soccerbase season|61254|2011|name=Joe Ralls|access-date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Yeovil Town====
Following Cardiff's promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2012–13 season, Ralls was made available for loan due to the lack of first-team opportunities available in the top tier, joining newly promoted [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on loan on 14 August until January 2014 to gain experience.&lt;ref name="Experience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-midfielder-joe-ralls-5734719 |title= Cardiff City midfielder Joe Ralls joins Yeovil Town on loan |publisher=WalesOnline |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeovilloan"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23715305 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper's injury halts Yeovil loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 17 August after coming on as a substitute in place of [[Kevin Dawson (footballer, born 1990)|Kevin Dawson]] during a 2–0 defeat to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeovildebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23644641 |title=Burnley 2–0 Yeovil Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the ''Glovers'' in his fourth appearance for the club on 14 September, netting his team's only goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]],&lt;ref name="firstyeovilgoal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23999421 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 1–1 Yeovil Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first goal the team had scored since [[Ed Upson]]'s winning goal on the opening day of the season a month previously.&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt;

Ralls expressed his satisfaction with joining the ''Glovers'', stating "Yeovil has worked out really well and I know I’ll improve my game here before I return to Cardiff.”&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt; He briefly returned to Cardiff following the expiration of his loan deal following the appointment of [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] as Cardiff manager in order for the Norwegian to assess his squad, missing Yeovil's [[FA Cup]] victory over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].&lt;ref name="Yeovilextension"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25697194 |title=Transfer window: Yeovil Town extend Joe Ralls loan from Cardiff |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Yeovil keen on extending the loan deal,&lt;ref name="waitinggame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/yeovil-town-play-waiting-game-pursuit-cardiff/story-20410170-detail/story.html |title=Yeovil Town play waiting game in pursuit of Cardiff City midfielder Joe Ralls and Nottingham Forest striker Ishmael Miller while ruling out move for Plymouth Argyle skipper Conor Hourihane |publisher=Western Morning News |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 January 2014, Ralls agreed an extension to his loan with Yeovil until the end of the season.&lt;ref name="Yeovilextension"/&gt;

====Return to Cardiff====
[[File:Coady Ralls.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Ralls (in blue) attacking against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].]]
His performances during his loan spell with Yeovil saw Cardiff manager Solskjær to offer Ralls a three-year extension to his contract at the Cardiff City Stadium on his return to the club and was awarded the man of the match award in his first appearance of the 2014–15 season, during a 2–1 victory over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]].&lt;ref name="Starlet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-starlet-joe-ralls-7617944 |title=Cardiff City starlet Joe Ralls keen to make a big impact after impressing at Coventry City |publisher=WalesOnline |date=14 August 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the departure of Solskjær soon after, Ralls continued to thrive under newly appointed Cardiff boss [[Russell Slade]], becoming a regular in the first team during the 2014–15 season, playing mostly as a left-sided midfielder due to intense competition for places in the centre of midfield from [[Peter Whittingham]] and [[Aron Gunnarsson]],&lt;ref name="Asset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/joe-ralls-now-real-asset-10474406 |title=Joe Ralls now a real asset says Russell Slade after midfielder signs new Cardiff City contract |publisher=WalesOnline |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; altogether playing 31 games and scoring 4 goals, before being handed a new five-year contract with the club set to run until 2020, to which manager Slade stated that he was "delighted" to keep Ralls at the club.&lt;ref name="Asset"/&gt;

At the start of the following season, he was handed the number 8 shirt and started in the left-sided midfield role against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on the opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squad number 2015/16 |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-201516-2598955.aspx |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff 1–1 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33744136 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2015 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls scored his only goal of the campaign in January against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–3 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35269833 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2016 |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls effort throughout the season had earned him the Young Player of the year award, whilst Cardiff just missed out on a play-off place to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref name="Youngplayeraward"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City end of season awards RECAP: Matthew Connolly named Player of the Year |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-end-season-awards-11299527 |work=South Wales Echo |author=Tucker, S, Smith, P |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Ralls signs fresh Cardiff City contract |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34873834 |work=BBC Sport |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralls celebrated his 100th appearance for Cardiff, by scoring a spectacular goal from 25 yards out against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in August, also opening his accounts for the [[2016–17 Cardiff City F.C. season|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fulham 2 – 2 Cardiff |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/fulham-vs-cardiff/358150 |work=Sky Sports Football |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for Player of the Month in January, following impressive performances scoring two against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and seeing Cardiff rise from the relegation battle to mid-table spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ralls nominated for Player of the Month |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/ralls-nominated-for-jan-sky-bet-championship-player-of-the-month-3564099.aspx |publisher=Cardiff City Official Sit |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ralls received his first international call for the [[England national under-19 football team|England Under-19s]] to replace the injured [[Robert Hall (footballer)|Robert Hall]] to play [[Czech Republic national under-19 football team|Czech Republic]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Squad named for Czech test |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u19s/News/Match%20Centre/2012/EnglandvCzechRep/Match-Previews/squad-announcement.aspx |publisher=The Football Association |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralls came on in the games to make his English debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malky Mackay thrilled with Joe Ralls’ England call-up |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city/cardiff-city-fc/2012/03/03/malky-mackay-thrilled-with-joe-ralls-england-call-up-91466-30448643/? |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Primarily a central midfield player, Ralls featured frequently at left midfield and left back during the early stages of his career at Cardiff and Yeovil, commenting that, although not a natural in either position, he can "do a job there" but admitted that he does "naturally tend to drift inside" when playing out of position.&lt;ref name="Lookingback"/&gt; Ralls has described himself as a box-to-box midfielder that "likes to get forward as much as possible".&lt;ref name="yeovillife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/ralls-enjoying-moment-time-glovers/story-19712869-detail/story.html |title=Ralls is enjoying every moment of his time with the Glovers |publisher=Somerset Live |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
