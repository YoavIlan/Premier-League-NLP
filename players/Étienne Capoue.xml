== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
Capoue was born in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Niort]] in Deux-Sèvres and began his career playing for hometown club [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Chamois Niortais]]. In 2002, he departed the club and joined FC Chauray, a local club in [[Poitou-Charentes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jcs9.free.fr/affiche_articles.php?article=153 | title = Le TFC, c'est la famille! | date = | accessdate = 18 July 2010 | publisher = Jeunes Citoyens Supporters | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capoue stayed at the club for two years before joining [[Angers SCO]] in [[Pays de la Loire]]. While playing in a youth league match against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]], Capoue drew the attention of the club's scouts who offered the player a one-week trial. Prior to agreeing to the internship, he was also approached by [[Lille OSC|Lille]], [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], and [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. Capoue chose Toulouse because of the club's training facilities and the good weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2006/12/06/28131-TFC-Etienne-Capoue-prend-son-envol.html | title = Etienne Capoue prend son envol | date = 6 December 2006 | accessdate = 18 July 2010 | publisher = La Depeche | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February 2008, Capoue, along with teammate [[Cheikh M'Bengue]], signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20080207_173707Dev.html | title = Capoue passe pro | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate = 18 July 2010 | publisher = [[L'Equipe]] | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]], Casanova paired the young defensive midfielder with former youth teammate [[Moussa Sissoko]] and new signing [[Étienne Didot]], who arrived from [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. The trio performed well in the midfield with Capoue flourishing making 36 total appearances. On 18 October 2008, Capoue scored his first professional goal against Bordeaux in a 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2008/2009&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J09&amp;num_ordre=2 | title = Bordeaux v.
