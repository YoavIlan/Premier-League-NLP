During the first half of the [[2011–12 Bundesliga|2011–12 season]], Gylfi fell out of favour with the club's new manager, making just seven league appearances and was linked with a move away from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/swansea-agree-68m-fee-with-hoffenheim-for-gylfi-sigurdsson-7793540.html |title=Swansea agree £6.8m fee with Hoffenheim for Gylfi Sigurdsson |work=The Independent |first=Carl |last=Markham |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Swansea City====
On 1 January 2012, it was announced Gylfi would join Premier League club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on loan for the rest of [[2011–12 Swansea City A.F.C. season|the season]].&lt;ref name="Gylfi Þór til Swansea City"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mbl.is/sport/enski/2012/01/01/gylfi_thor_til_swansea/ |title=Gylfi Þór til Swansea City |work=Morgunblaðið |first=Guðmundur |last=Hilmarsson |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut for Swansea on 15 January, coming on at half-time and setting up the winning goal in a 3–2 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Swansea City vs Arsenal Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/60410/swansea-city-vs-arsenal/report |title=Swansea City vs Arsenal Report |publisher=Goal.com |date=15 January 2012 |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, Gylfi scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16778814 |title=West Brom 1–2 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Peter |last=Shuttleworth |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created Swansea's other goal for [[Danny Graham (footballer)|Danny Graham]], taking his tally to three assists in four matches.

As a result of his fine form, Gylfi was named the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for March, the first Icelander to win the award.&lt;ref name="POTM12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/17617434 |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson wins Premier League player award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next goal came in a 3–0 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] that put the club on 42 points for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/17643123 |title=Swansea 3–0 Blackburn |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Chris |last=Osborne |date=14 April 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May, Swansea agreed a £6.8&amp;nbsp;million fee with 1899 Hoffenheim for the permanent transfer of Gylfi, subject to him passing a medical. However, following Swansea manager [[Brendan Rodgers]]' move to Liverpool, the deal collapsed, despite [[Huw Jenkins (Welsh businessman)|Huw Jenkins]] keeping hope in the deal alight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1080222/swansea-strike-68m-gylfi-sigurdsson-deal |title=Swans strike Sigurdsson deal |publisher=ESPN FC |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 18 Premier League matches during his loan spell for Swansea, Gylfi scored seven goals and added four assists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/05/28/3132200/swansea-city-agree-club-record-68m-fee-for-sigurdsson |title=Swansea City agree club-record £6.8m fee for Sigurdsson |publisher=Goal.com |first=David |last=Lynch |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===

On 4 July 2012, Gylfi joined Tottenham Hotspur from 1899 Hoffenheim for a reported £8&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18599662 |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson joins Tottenham from Hoffenheim |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first signing for newly appointed Spurs manager [[André Villas-Boas]]. On 18 July, he scored his first goal for the club in a friendly against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] after coming on as a second-half substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/english-football/2012/07/20/3254427/sigurdsson-delighted-after-scoring-first-goal-for-tottenham |title=Sigurdsson delighted after scoring first goal for Tottenham |publisher=Goal.com |first=Simon |last=Sinclair |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September, he scored his first competitive goal for the club in a [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] third round tie away against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], closing the scoring in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19645193 |title=Carlisle 0–3 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian McDermott (footballer)|Brian McDermott]] confirmed Reading made three unsuccessful bids to bring Gylfi back to his former club during the [[List of English football transfers winter 2012–13|January 2013 transfer window]], including a club record offer on deadline day thought by [[BBC Sport]] to be around £10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21291221 |title=Gylfi Sigurdsson: Reading failed with bid for Tottenham player |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, Gylfi scored his first Premier League goal for Tottenham, the second goal in a 3–2 win against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].

This win took Spurs up to second in the [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League table]]. Gylfi's momentum in the Tottenham team continued on 28 September 2013, as he scored in a 1–1 home draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2435171/Tottenham-1-Chelsea-1-match-report-John-Terry-equalises-Fernando-Torres-sent-off.html |title=Tottenham 1 Chelsea 1: Terry cancels out Sigurdsson opener before Torres sees red |work=[[Daily Mail]] |first=Rob |last=Draper |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Swansea City===
In July 2014, Tottenham announced a deal had been reached with Swansea City for Gylfi to re-join his former club, with Swansea left-back [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1993)|Ben Davies]] joining Spurs. On the move, Gylfi said, "I really enjoyed my time here last time. I know the club, I know the manager, I know the players and I obviously know the fans and the city as well, so that wasn't that difficult for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/1958399/tottenham-add-ben-daviesmichel-vorm;-deal-gylfi-sigurdsson-to-swansea |title=Spurs add Davies, Vorm from Swansea |work=PA Sport |publisher=ESPN FC |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening match of the [[2014–15 Swansea City A.F.C. season|2014–15 season]], he set up the opener and scored the winning goal as Swansea defeated [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–1 at [[Old Trafford]], making this the first time the ''Red Devils'' have lost their opening home game since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/28718345 |title=Man Utd 1–2 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014 |first=Chris |last=Bevan |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gylfi continued his good start to his Swansea return with another three assists in his next two matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77278000/jpg/_77278344_f822bf74-3665-4c89-9594-34521ac67682.jpg |title=On hand again |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a home match against Arsenal on 9 November 2014, Gylfi curled a free-kick over the wall and into the corner of the net from 25 yards to equalise in an eventual 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/match/395661/swansea-city-arsenal/report |title=Bafetimbi Gomis heads home Swansea winner as Arsenal throw away late lead |work=PA Sport |publisher=ESPN FC |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gylfi scored in a 4–1 away defeat against Liverpool at [[Anfield]] on 29 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30572378 |title=Liverpool 4–1 Swansea City |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=Dawkes |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
