'''Michel Armand Vorm''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmiʃɛl ˈvɔrm}}; born 20 October 1983) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] footballer who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Vorm began his professional career at [[FC Utrecht]] in 2005, spending his first season on loan at [[FC Den Bosch]]. He transferred to [[Swansea City]] in 2011, playing three [[Premier League]] seasons and winning the [[2013 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 2013]]. Vorm joined Tottenham for £3.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2014.

A full international for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] since 2009, Vorm was included in their squads for two World Cups and [[Euro 2012]], as back-up in all three tournaments.

==Club career==

===FC Utrecht===
Born in [[IJsselstein]] to a Dutch mother and a [[Suriname]]se father,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/10422121/I-love-this-type-of-game-no-matter-how-intense-it-is-says-Swanseas-Michel-Vorm-ahead-of-derby-against-Cardiff.html|title = 'I love this type of game, no matter how intense it is,' says Swansea's Michel Vorm ahead of derby against Cardiff|website = The Daily Telegraph|access-date = 6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorm began his career at [[FC Utrecht]]. In order to gain more experience, he spent the 2005–06 season on loan to [[FC Den Bosch]].  He made his debut on 12 August 2005 against [[FC Emmen]], the first of 35 appearances that season.

In August 2006, Vorm made his debut for Utrecht against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]]. Although he joined FC Utrecht as the third-choice goalkeeper, behind [[Franck Grandel]] and [[Joost Terol]], his pre-season performances impressed manager [[Foeke Booy]], and saw him promoted to first choice 'keeper at the start of the league season. During this first season Vorm played 33 out of 34 matches, and his position as number one at the club remained unchallenged thereafter. Vorm missed a handful matches during the 2007–08 season due to knee and shoulder injuries. He left Utrecht at the start of the 2011–12 season, having played 136 matches in the [[Eredivisie]].

===Swansea City===
In August 2011, Vorm joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a fee of around £1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/07/swansea-michel-vorm-utrecht|title=Swansea agree fee for Dutch international goalkeeper Michel Vorm|date=7 August 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He took the vacant number 1 shirt and made his debut for the club against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 15 August 2011 in a 4–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=318034|title=Manchester City vs. Swansea City – Football Match Report – August 15, 2011 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he conceded four goals, he also made eleven saves&amp;nbsp;– more than any other Premier League goalkeeper, in a single match, in the whole of the 2011–12 season. In his second match for Swansea against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], on 20 August, Vorm saved a 72nd-minute penalty from [[Ben Watson (footballer born July 1985)|Ben Watson]], to give Swansea their first ever point in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14514711.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Swansea 0–0 Wigan | date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2011, Vorm arguably saved Swansea from defeat against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and earned them the draw at [[Anfield]] by pulling off two outstanding saves to earn the [[clean sheet]]. On 10 December, he was instrumental in Swansea's 2–0 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] as he saved [[Clint Dempsey]]'s 87th-minute penalty, with Swansea 1–0 up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16015563 | title = Swansea 2–0 Fulham | date = 10 December 2011| accessdate = 10 December 2011 | publisher = BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first season with Swansea he helped keep 13 clean sheets in 37 league appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11kicks.com/Teams/Swansea_City_1/Stats |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323153459/http://www.11kicks.com/Teams/Swansea_City_1/Stats |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances were so impressive that he won three awards at the club's end-of-season dinner&amp;nbsp;– Supporters' Player of the Year, Players' Player and the Away Player awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vorm's triple trophy swoop|url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/awards-night-207835.aspx|publisher=[[Swansea City A.F.C.]]|date=10 May 2012}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2012, Vorm signed a new four-year contract with Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19658904|title=Goalkeeper Michel Vorm signs new Swansea City contract|date=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2012, he was ruled out for up to eight weeks due to a groin injury picked up in a match against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20113017|title=Swansea City suffer goalkeeper Michel Vorm injury blow|date=28 October 2012|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2013, in the [[South Wales derby]] against Cardiff City, Vorm was shown a straight red card by referee [[Mike Dean (referee)|Mike Dean]] for a stoppage-time foul on [[Fraizer Campbell]]. The match ended 1–0 to Cardiff City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Cardiff 1–0 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24690406|accessdate=6 July 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===

On 23 July 2014, Vorm announced via Dutch radio that he would sign for [[Tottenham Hotspur]] to compete with [[Hugo Lloris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/69/transfer-zone/2014/07/23/4977923/vorm-confirms-tottenham-switch?ICID=HP_BN_11|title=Vorm Confirms Tottenham Switch|date=23 July 2014|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed on a four-year deal costing Spurs £3.5&amp;nbsp;million after three years at Swansea, joining on the same day as Swansea's [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1993)|Ben Davies]] made the same move and [[Gylfi Sigurðsson]] was exchanged as part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2703258/Ben-Davies-Michel-Vorm-sign-Tottenham-Swansea-Gylfi-Sigurdsson-heads-Wales-deal.html|title=Ben Davies and Michel Vorm join Spurs from Swansea as Gylfi Sigurdsson heads to Wales as part of deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was disputed by Utrecht, who complained to FIFA that they were contractually due 30% of the fee received by Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City: Utrecht report club to Fifa over Vorm fee|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28701743|accessdate=11 August 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA rejected Utrecht's claim, and the case was heard in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michel Vorm: Swansea due in court over Tottenham transfer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35438556|accessdate=29 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut for Tottenham on 24 September, in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at home against [[Nottingham Forest]]. Despite conceding first to [[Jorge Grant]], Tottenham won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham 3–1 Nottm Forest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233056|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorm featured again in the next round on 29 October, keeping his first clean sheet for the club as Tottenham defeated [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham 2–0 Brighton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29718447|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later he played his first [[UEFA Europa League]] match for Tottenham, a 2–1 win away to [[Asteras Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abraham|first1=Timothy|title=Asteras Tripolis 1–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29919621|accessdate=6 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorm's first league appearance for Tottenham came on 21 March 2015, after Lloris went off injured in the fourth minute of a home match against [[Leicester City]]. Tottenham won 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Tottenham 4–3 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31883462|accessdate=22 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April he made his first league start, a goalless draw against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliver|first1=Pete|title=Burnley 0–0 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32103945|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2016, Vorm made his first appearance of the 2016–17 season for Tottenham Hotspur in a 1–1 draw with Everton at Goodison Park, in which he replaced the injured Lloris after 35 minutes.

==International career==
In 2006, he was a member of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad that won the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006]] in Portugal.

Vorm played his first match for the senior national team on 14 November 2008, replacing [[Henk Timmer (footballer)|Henk Timmer]] at half time in a 3–1 home friendly win, conceding to [[Kim Källström]] within four minutes of coming on. He made his first start on 5 September 2009 in a friendly home match against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (3–0 win), followed up four days later by an impressive performance at [[Hampden Park]] during the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]&amp;nbsp;– Netherlands, a match won 1–0 by the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/09/world-cup-scotland-holland]&amp;nbsp;– Holland end luckless Scotland's World Cup hopes&amp;nbsp;– 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8240464.stm]&amp;nbsp;– BBC Sports Scotland 0–1 Netherlands &amp;nbsp;– 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
At Hampden Park, this was Vorm's first competitive match ever outside the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/08/scotland-holland-maarten-stekelenburg-goalkeeper]&amp;nbsp;– Novice Dutch goalkeeper offers Scots glimmer of hope&amp;nbsp;– 8 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup===
Vorm was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 | agency=Agence France-Presse|date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager [[Bert van Marwijk]] announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the start of the competition he was allowed to fly back to the Netherlands. During the World Cup, Vorm's girlfriend Daisy delivered a son, Jaivy Waylon. The Dutch goalkeeper returned home for two days following his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1049/Oranje/article/detail/490374/2010/06/14/Zoontje-voor-doelman-Vorm-Jaivy-Waylon.dhtml |title=Zoontje voor doelman Vorm: Jaivy Waylon |work=Algemeen Dagblad|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/%28/actueel/rtlboulevard/nieuws/articleview/%29/components/actueel/rtlboulevard/2010/06_juni/entertainment/Op_babybezoek_bij_michel_vorm.xml |title=Op babybezoek bij Oranje-keeper Michel Vorm |publisher=RTL.nl| date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010| language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euro 2012===
Vorm was included in the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad for [[Euro 2012]]. [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] was [[Bert van Marwijk]]'s first choice in goal, playing all three games as the nation exited in the group stage.

===2014 World Cup===
For the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], coach [[Louis van Gaal]] included Vorm in the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] squad, alongside young Ajax goalkeeper [[Jasper Cillessen]] who was first choice in goal and [[Tim Krul]]. Despite his{{clarify|date=January 2019}} penalty-saving ability, Van Gaal opted to replace Cillessen with Krul in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] during the quarter-final match against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Vorm came on for Cillessen in injury time of the 3–0 third place play-off win against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Brasília]], thus ensuring that all 23 Dutch squad members played at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28173517|title=Brazil 0–3 Netherlands|date=12 July 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
