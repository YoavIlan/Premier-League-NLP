'''Julián Maria Speroni''' ({{IPA-es|xuˈljan espeˈɾoni}}; born 18 May 1979) is an Argentine [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Having begun his career at [[Club Atlético Platense|Platense]], he played three seasons in the [[Scottish Premier League]] with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] before joining Crystal Palace for £750,000 in 2004. He has played 400 matches across all competitions for his current club.

==Club career==
===Dundee===
Speroni was born in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; He started his career with [[Club Atlético Platense]], in his homeland, but moved after just one year as a professional and two matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistaeldiego.net/2012/12/julian-speroni-conquistador-silencioso.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141029131030/http://www.revistaeldiego.net/2012/12/julian-speroni-conquistador-silencioso.html |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]. Dundee manager [[Ivano Bonetti]] received advice from an Italian contact to Speroni's potential. The move to Dundee was delayed for two months, due to administration delays in Argentina, holding up Speroni's application for an Italian passport.&lt;ref name="Interview with Speroni 2002"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+I+OWE+EVERYTHING+TO+IVANO.-a0102435273 Interview with Speroni 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===

He signed for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], newly promoted to the [[Premier League]], on 13 July 2004, for a fee of around £750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speroni joins Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/3811683.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speroni made his debut for Palace against Everton in a three goals to one defeat. Speroni only started the first six games for his newly promoted team in their Premier League campaign, before he was replaced by Hungarian international [[Gábor Király]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

His first three seasons at [[Selhurst Park]] saw him largely play understudy to Király who made the goalkeeping spot his own. This was until the Hungarian departed Selhurst Park at the end of the 2006–07 season. Back in the line-up Speroni flourished and won his reputation back.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Palace managed to reach the play-offs with Speroni earning a new three-year contract at the end of the 2007–08 season and the club's "[[Crystal Palace F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]]" award. At the end of the following season, he retained Palace's "Player of the Year" award.

In the 2009–10 season, Speroni again drew praise. Like at Dundee, his club fell into financial difficulty, and finished the season in administration. This meant a ten-point deduction, and survival was only secured on the final day of the season. For his role in this, Speroni was given a new record, becoming the first man to win Palace's "Player of the Year" award for three consecutive years. Then on 10 December 2010, Speroni agreed a 3 1⁄2 year extension to his current contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speroni commits to Palace|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11706/6565971/speroni-commits-to-palace|publisher=Sky Sports|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Speroni was named Player of the Year for the fourth time.&lt;ref name="POTY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/may/speroni-lands-fourth-player-of-the-year-award/|title=Speroni Lands Fourth Player of the Year Award|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=6 May 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418225344/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/may/speroni-lands-fourth-player-of-the-year-award/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract expired early into 2014 and he subsequently negotiated contract offers with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premier League clubs submit retained and released lists |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504185633/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |archivedate= 4 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julian Speroni could leave Crystal Palace|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/466697/Julian-Speroni-could-leave-Crystal-Palace|publisher=Daily Express|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2014 Crystal Palace announced that Speroni had signed a new contract with the club for 12 months with a further 12 month option. Speroni is much loved by the Crystal Palace fans and has become a cult hero at the club being named the supporters' player of the season on four separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/june/speroni-signs-new-contract/|title=Speroni Signs New Contract|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418224142/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/june/speroni-signs-new-contract/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speroni was rewarded for his years of service to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] with a Testimonial match against [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on 26 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/dundee-to-play-in-speroni-testimonial|title=DUNDEE TO PLAY IN SPERONI TESTIMONIAL|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418223255/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/dundee-to-play-in-speroni-testimonial|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speroni made his 347th league appearance for the club, breaking [[John Jackson (footballer, born 1942)|John Jackson]]'s record as the team's goalkeeper with the most league appearances, against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/february/speroni-breaks-league-record/|title=Speroni Breaks League Record|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418224724/https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/february/speroni-breaks-league-record/|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, prior to the testimonial, Speroni was inducted into the [[Dundee F.C.#Hall of Fame|Dundee Hall of Fame]] picking up the International Award which was previously won by fellow countryman [[Claudio Caniggia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/the-2015-dundee-fc-hall-of-fame-2|title=2015 Dundee FC Hall of Fame 2|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=28 March 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418223911/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/the-2015-dundee-fc-hall-of-fame-2|archivedate=18 April 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, Speroni signed a one-year contract extension at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to keep him at the club until at least the end of the [[2015-16 Premier League|2015–16 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speroni Extends Eagles Stay|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/may/speroni-extends-eagles-stay/|publisher=Crystal Palace|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped to third-choice goalkeeper in that season, behind [[Wayne Hennessey]] and [[Alex McCarthy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Pardew reveals why he dropped this Crystal Palace ace|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/500256/Alan-Pardew-Crystal-Palace-FA-Cup-Julian-Speroni-Premier-League-fans-right-to-criticise|publisher=Daily Star|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still played 2 league games, including the league match against [[Southampton F.C.]] in the final day of the season, when he equaled [[John Jackson (footballer, born 1942)|John Jackson]]’s club appearance record as a goalkeeper in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaney and Speroni Sign New Deals|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/june/delaney-and-speroni-sign-new-deals/|publisher=Crystal Palace|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed another one-year contract extension on 13 June 2016 to remain with the club until the end of [[2016-17 Premier League|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace duo Julian Speroni and Damien Delaney sign new one-year deals|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36520014|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2017 he was named a starter in Palace's match day squad again, helping them to a 2–1 win over defending champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/october/match-report-for-crystal-palace-vs-chelsea-on-14-oct-17/|title=Crystal Palace FC Report: Crystal Palace 2–1 Chelsea|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

In November 1998, Speroni was named in the squad for a friendly against Japan U20 in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La nómina del Sub 21|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/117437-la-nomina-del-sub-21|publisher=La Nacion|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=11 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, he was called into the Argentina U20 pre-selection squad for the [[1999 South American U-20 Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farías y Duscher se agregaron al plantel|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/12/27/r-06601d.htm|publisher=clarin.com|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=27 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina's under 20 team played friendlies against Hungary and Denmark. On 30 December [[José Pékerman]] did not name him in the final squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ya está la lis20|url=http://pdf.diariohoy.net/1998/12/30/cla6y7.pdf|publisher=diariohoy.net|accessdate=26 February 2014|language=Spanish|date=30 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307004221/http://pdf.diariohoy.net/1998/12/30/cla6y7.pdf|archive-date=7 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speroni made one appearance for the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina U20]] team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11706/9163143/crystal-palace-goalkeeper-julian-speroni-targets-argentina-place&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Speroni also holds an Italian passport, for which he qualified through his grandfather.&lt;ref name="Interview with Speroni 2002"/&gt;

Speroni owned a restaurant in [[Purley, London|Purley]], south London that was named 'Speroni's.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace keeper Julian Speroni opens new restaurant|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Crystal-Palace-keeper-Julian-Speroni-opens-new/story-20521896-detail/story.html|publisher=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=29 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302014112/http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Crystal-Palace-keeper-Julian-Speroni-opens-new/story-20521896-detail/story.html|archive-date=2 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant closed in October 2016 following "structural issues" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace legend Julian Speroni reveals why his Purley restaurant closed down|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/8203-more-detail-revealed-about-why-julian-speroni-s-restaurant-closed-down/story-30016499-detail/story.html|publisher=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
