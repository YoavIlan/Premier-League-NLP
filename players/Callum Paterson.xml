During his debut season Paterson made twenty seven appearances, scoring four times&lt;ref&gt;{{Soccerbase season|65785|2012|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so he played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|right-back]], [[midfielder]] and as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/hearts/191436-hearts-boss-says-callum-paterson-will-be-a-full-time-striker-after-double/ | title=Hearts boss says Callum Paterson will be a full-time striker after double | publisher=[[Scottish Television|STV]] | work=sport.stv.tv | date=22 September 2012 | accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-match-reports/spl-dundee-united-0-hearts-1338938 | title=Hearts starlet Callum Paterson set for extended run up front | publisher=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] | work=dailyrecord.co.uk | date=23 September 2012 | accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2013, Paterson scored his first goal of the 2013–14 campaign, when he headed home the only goal in the [[Edinburgh derby]] against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at Tynecastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23565318 | title=A Callum Paterson header gave Hearts a vital victory and bragging rights in a frantic and edgy Edinburgh derby. | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | work=bbc.co.uk/sport | date=11 August 2013 | accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2014, Paterson scored a brace against city rivals Hibernian in a 2–1 win. A week later he scored again in a 5–0 win over [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and also scored three days later against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Hearts were relegated at the end of the season, but immediately won promotion by winning the [[2014–15 Scottish Championship]]. In their first season back in the top flight, Hearts finished third in the [[2015–16 Scottish Premiership]] and qualified for European competition.

During the summer of 2016, Patterson was subject to interest from several [[EFL Championship]] sides, with Hearts rejecting two bids from [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Hearts reject new Wigan bid for full-back |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37181276 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2016 |accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the interest, he stayed at the club, managing to score 9 goals in 20 appearances, before suffering a serious knee injury on 27 December, which ruled him out for six to nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Hearts right-back sidelined for six to nine months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38450959 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite missing the last few months of the season, Paterson managed to pick up the club's Young Player of the Year Award.&lt;ref name=YPLOY/&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 7 June 2017, Paterson agreed a three-year deal with [[EFL Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callum Paterson: Scotland defender joins Cardiff City on three-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40189922 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knee injury suffered at Hearts kept him out of the first two months of the season, making his playing return for the [[Cardiff City F.C. Academy|Under-23 side]] in a 4–0 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], on 18 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U23 Match Report Burnley 0–4 Cardiff City |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2017/september/match-report-for-burnley-u23-vs-cardiff-city-u23-on-18-sep-17/ |publisher=Cardiff City Football Club |date=18 September 2017 |accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October, Paterson returned to the first team, making his debut in a 1–0 win over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], before scoring his first goal for the club, the winner at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41618274 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2017 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barnsley 0–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41978131 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff manager, [[Neil Warnock]] moved Paterson into a central midfield position in the new year, later stating the reasoning behind the move was because he couldn't defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42682884 |title=Callum Paterson: Cardiff 'wobble' out of way, says Scotland international |date=15 January 2018 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Warnock reveals why he won't actually play 'defender' Callum Paterson in defence |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-warnock-reveals-wont-actually-14419127 |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 March 2018 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his move to the new position, Paterson scored a brace against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 13 January and found the back of the net three times in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–0 Sunderland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42587431 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2018 |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his good form throughout the rest of the season, scoring 10 goals, ending as the club's top goal scorer in the league, as they were promoted to the [[Premier League]]. Paterson was also voted Young Player of the Season by the Cardiff fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Awards 2018: The Winners |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2018/may/awards-2018/ |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=6 May 2018 |accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson played his first Premier League game against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] on the opening day of the season. As Cardiff struggled for goals, Paterson was moved into a central forward role, where he scored his first Premier League goal in a 4–2 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 4–2 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45847412 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Paterson earned caps at both [[Scotland national under-18 football team|under-18]] and [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] level in 2012 before establishing himself as a regular in [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu21/player.php?playerid=545|title=Scotland U21 player Callum Paterson |website=FitbaStats|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2014, manager [[Gordon Strachan]] called Paterson into the [[Scotland national football team|senior Scottish squad]] for the first time after [[Phil Bardsley]] pulled out of the squad injured, ahead of a European qualifier against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and a friendly against [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearts defender Callum Paterson called up by Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29989566|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his senior debut for Scotland on 29 May 2016 in a 1–0 friendly defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].
