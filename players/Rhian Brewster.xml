'''Rhian Joel Brewster''' (born 1 April 2000) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[England national under-18 football team|England U18]] national team. In 2017, he was part of the England squad which won the [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] and was awarded the Golden Boot award for ending as the competition's leading goalscorer.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born and raised in the [[London]] area, Brewster attended school at Chadwell Heath Primary School before joining the Chadwell Heath and Shield Football academies.&lt;ref name=never&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41753629|title=Rhian Brewster: 'I've never seen a player like him before'|date=25 October 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Chowdhury|first=Saj|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, he was scouted by representatives from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]]. He ultimately joined Chelsea where he developed his game under coach Michael Beale in [[Chelsea F.C. Under-23s and Academy|the club's academy]] until the age of 14, whereafter he left to join [[Premier League]] rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=never/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/rhian-brewster-england-liverpool-under-17-world-cup-final|title=Rhian Brewster: England U17’s natural finisher on the fast-track at Liverpool|website=Guardian|last=Hunter|first=Andy|date=26 October 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
In 2015, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] signed Brewster from Chelsea following a recommendation by Beale who had taken up a position with the club. Brewster's decision to make the move was motivated in part by his father's influence who believed that he had a better chance of breaking through to the first team through Liverpool's academy than Chelsea's.&lt;ref name=never/&gt;&lt;ref name=TIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisanfield.com/2017/01/rhian-brewster-liverpool-academy-forward-set-breakthrough-2017/|title=Rhian Brewster: Liverpool academy forward set for a breakthrough 2017|website=This is Anfield|last=Lusby|first=Jack|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rhian-brewster-who-liverpool-youngster-11979122|title=Rhian Brewster&amp;nbsp;— who is the Liverpool youngster who scored five in two games for England?|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially joined the club's U18 side before being promoted to the U23 squad, where he scored on his debut against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-youngster-rhian-brewster-snubbing-12698860|title=Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster on snubbing Chelsea, sleepless nights and being inspired by Suarez|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the club's academy, Brewster was placed on a special training regime which included one-on-one sessions with former Liverpool and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] winger, [[Steve McManaman]].&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;

Brewster was then called up by [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Jürgen Klopp]] to the first-team for club [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendlies]] in October and November 2016 during which he scored a [[hat-trick]] against [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]].&lt;ref name=TIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/gomez-ends-liverpool-injury-nightmare-12169550|title=Gomez ends Liverpool injury nightmare|first=Andy|last=Kelly|date=13 November 2016|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, he was named on the bench for Liverpool's [[Premier League]] game against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 23 April 2017, but remained an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39612237|title=Liverpool 1–2 Crystal Palace|date=23 April 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, during Liverpool's [[UEFA Youth League]] match against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], Brewster was the victim of alleged racist comments from Spartak's captain, [[Leonid Mironov]]. An investigation into the incident was opened by [[UEFA]] after the match and Brewster later said in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' that it had been the seventh such instance he had experienced, including once before against the same opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa|title=Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster: ‘When I’m racially abused, I just want to be left alone’|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|work=The Guardian|date=28 December 2017|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhian Brewster: England and Liverpool striker alleges racial abuse|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42511863|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA later ruled that there was insufficient evidence to take further action against Mironov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-praise-rhian-brewster-courage-14379583|title=Liverpool praise Rhian Brewster for courage during UEFA investigation|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2018, during an U23 match against [[Manchester City F.C. EDS and Academy|Manchester City]], Brewster received oxygen and had to be stretchered off the field after landing awkwardly following an aerial challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rhian-brewster-stretchered-during-liverpool-14150160|title=Rhian Brewster stretchered off during Liverpool U23s match against Man City|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Jones|first=Adam|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later diagnosed with a [[Sprained ankle|high ankle sprain]] and related ligament damage and was ruled out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-striker-rhian-brewster-confirmed-14156981|title=Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster confirmed with ligament damage|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/highly-rated-liverpool-striker-rhian-14203567|title=Highly-rated Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster likely to miss rest of the season|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Kelly|first=Andy|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he had to undergo a second operation in order to repair damage to his knee which he sustained during the same incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-youngster-rhian-brewster-undergoes-14380383|title=Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster undergoes second operation on ankle injury|website=Liverpool Echo|last=Pearce|first=James|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Towards the end of the season, Brewster was the subject of intense transfer speculation which culminated in Liverpool cancelling a scheduled friendly against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] after the German club were alleged to have [[Tapping up|tapped]] him up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11378817/liverpool-cancel-borussia-m246nchengladbach-game-over-rhian-brewster|title=Liverpool cancel Borussia Mönchengladbach game over Rhian Brewster|publisher=Sky Sports|date=19 May 2018|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, he signed a five-year professional contract with Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44522780|title=Rhian Brewster: Liverpool forward agrees new contract|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2018|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Brewster is an England youth international and has represented the nation at various youth levels but remains eligible to play for [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] as his mother is Turkish Cypriot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turkish-football.com/revealed-17-year-old-rhian-brewster-makes-liverpool-squad-eligible-represent-turkey/|title=Exclusive: Liverpool wonder-kid Rhian Brewster can represent Turkey|date=23 April 2017|publisher=|last=Sarigul|first=Emre|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hülya Hassan: Rhian hat-trick yapınca ağladım|url=http://www.halkinsesikibris.com/spor-gundemi/hulya-hassan-rhian-hat-trick-yapinca-agladim-h86169.html|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=Halkın Sesi|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===England national youth teams===
Having previously represented England at U16 level, Brewster scored six goals in five appearances for [[England national under-17 football team|England U17]] in 2016, including a hat-trick against [[Croatia national under-17 football team|Croatia]] and a brace against [[Germany national under-17 football team|Germany]].&lt;ref name=TIA/&gt; He then led the nation's attack at [[2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]] and featured in the final against [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]]. England ultimately lost on [[penalty shootout|penalties]] with Brewster one of the players who missed his spot-kick.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/season=2017/matches/round=2000714/match=2022691/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Spot-on Spain claim record third U17 EURO title|website=UEFA|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the tournament with a return of three goals in six appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/season=2017/teams/player=250104084/index.html|title=Uner-17 - Rhian Brewster|website=UEFA|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Brewster gained widespread press attention &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/sports/soccer/premier-league-england.html|title=For England’s Next Generation, Shine of Youth Trophies Only Carries So Far|date=28 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; after scoring successive hat-tricks against the [[United States men's national under-17 soccer team|USA]] and [[Brazil national under-17 football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final and semi-finals of the [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/25/england-under-17-world-cup-final-rhian-brewster-brazil-match-report|title=England in U17 World Cup final after Rhian Brewster hat-trick sinks Brazil|first=Daniel|last=Harris|date=25 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/team/england-u17/5054/blog/post/3238534/rhian-brewster-announces-himself-with-complete-performance-against-us|title=Brewster announces himself with complete performance against U.S.|last=Selvaraj|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-under-17s-fifa-world-cup-final-vs-brazil-rhian-brewster-liverpool-striker-how-old-who-does-a8019311.html|title=England have reached another World Cup final|date=25 October 2017|publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored England's opening goal in the final as the team overcame Spain 5–2 to claim the trophy.&lt;ref name=WC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/28/england-under-17-spain-under-17-world-cup|title=England Under-17s overwhelm Spain to land spectacular World Cup win|first=Will|last=Unwin|date=28 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewster's return of eight goals for the tournament saw him win the Golden Boot award for the top scorer and he was also awarded the Bronze Ball for his individual performances.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/news/y=2017/m=10/news=brewster-foden-lead-individual-honours-2918145.html|title=Brazao, Brewster and Foden lead individual honours|website=FIFA|date=28 October 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Brewster revealed in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' that his teammate [[Morgan Gibbs-White]] was racially abused by a Spanish player during the match with the FA reporting the incident to FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/28/liverpool-rhian-brewster-racial-abuse-england-uefa|title=Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster: ‘When I’m racially abused, I just want to be left alone’|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 December 2017|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
