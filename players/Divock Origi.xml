'''Divock Okoth Origi''' ({{IPA-all|diˈvɔk ɔˈkɔθ oˈrigiː|[[Kenyan English]]:|Divock Origi pronunciation.ogg}}; born 18 April 1995) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Forward|forward]] for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. He is the son of former Kenyan professional footballer [[Mike Origi]].

Origi began his career at  [[Lille OSC|Lille]], and scored on his professional debut for them in 2013. A year and a half later, he was signed for £10&amp;nbsp;million by Liverpool, who loaned him back to Lille for the [[2014–15 Ligue 1]] season.

Origi made his international debut for Belgium in 2014, and was part of their team which reached the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], during which he became the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Origi began his career playing football at [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]'s youth academy where he spent nine years before signing for [[LOSC Lille|Lille]] in May 2010, aged 15, after turning down an approach by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/origi-turning-down-manchester-united-10994105|title=Origi: Why turning down United and ending up at Liverpool was best thing for me|last=Doyle|first=Ian|website=liverpoolecho|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lille===

On 24 January 2013, Origi was an unused substitute in Lille's 3–1 away win over [[Stade Plabennecois|Plabennec]] in a [[2012–13 Coupe de France|2012–13]] [[Coupe de France]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/lacklustre-lille-held-at-home.htm |title=Lacklustre Lille held at home |date=2 February 2013 |publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel |accessdate=5 February 2013 |archivedate=17 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121120/http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/lacklustre-lille-held-at-home.htm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days later, he scored on his competitive debut for the senior Lille side, coming on as a substitute in the 69th minute for [[Ronny Rodelin]] and scoring to bring his side from 1–0 down against [[Troyes AC|Troyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=fr |date=3 February 2013 |url=http://www.losc.fr/actualite-foot-lille/ligue-1/b-pedretti-origi-le-rayon-de-soleil-de-la-soiree |title=B.

===Liverpool===
On 29 July 2014, [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] announced that they had completed a £10&amp;nbsp;million transfer for Origi, who signed a five-year contract but was immediately loaned back to Lille for the [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/167369-reds-complete-origi-deal|title=Reds complete Origi deal|date=29 July 2014|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28551650 |title=Liverpool sign Belgium striker Divock Origi from Lille for £10m |date=29 July 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729230536/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28551650 |archivedate=29 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season: Loan to Lille====
In his first match back in Lille, Origi scored his first goal of the new Ligue 1 season through a penalty against [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]] to secure a 1–0 win for his side. This was after he had been brought down in the box by defender [[Dennis Appiah]], who was sent off by the referee towards the 70th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/321521/report |title=Ligue report: Lille let off the hook |date=15 August 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, as Lille lost 0–3 at home to [[VfL Wolfsburg]] to be eliminated from the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage|UEFA Europa League group stage]], Origi had a penalty saved by [[Diego Benaglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=LOSC left high and dry by Wolfsburg|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000587/match=2014565/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=UEFA|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2015, Origi scored a [[hat-trick]] for Lille in a 3–0 league win against [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/french-ligue-1/match/393429/lille-stade-rennes/report |title=Origi back with a bang in Lille win |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/feuille_match/79062 Lille 3–0 Rennais Match Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2015, Origi was named in Liverpool's 30-man squad for their pre-season tour of Thailand, Australia and Malaysia. In his non-competitive debut for Liverpool, a pre-season friendly against [[Thai Premier League All-Star Football|Thai All-Stars]] on 14 July, Origi scored his first goal for the club in a 4–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-4-0-thai-stars-9656001|title= Liverpool FC 4–0 Thai All Stars: Origi nets debut goal as monsoon fails to dampen Reds' pre-season stroll|date=14 July 2015|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first competitive game for the team was on 12 September, replacing [[Danny Ings]] for the final sixteen minutes of a 3–1 loss at [[Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Man Utd 3–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34160795|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Origi scored his first competitive Liverpool goals on 2 December, a hat-trick in a 6–1 away win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the quarter-finals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 1–6 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34918281|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven days later, he scored his first Premier League goal, replacing the injured [[Dejan Lovren]] in the 79th minute and scoring an added-time equaliser from outside the penalty area for a 2–2 draw against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Anfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawkes|first1=Phil|title=Liverpool 2–2 West Brom|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35018987|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February, he scored his second league goal against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a 6–0 victory, only 27 seconds after replacing [[Daniel Sturridge]] in the second half; this was the fastest goal scored by a substitute that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35515112|title=Aston Villa 0–6 Liverpool|date=14 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2016, Liverpool manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] surprisingly started Origi ahead of Sturridge (the team's first-choice striker) during Liverpool's [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League knockout phase|Europa League quarter-final]] match against [[Borussia Dortmund]], Klopp's former side. Origi scored a vital away goal in [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Borussia Dortmund v Liverpool|the 1–1 draw]]. Three days later, he scored two goals in a 4–1 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] after coming on as a substitute to replace [[Sheyi Ojo]] at half-time.

====2016–17 season====
Origi was used predominantly as a substitute and cup player at the start of [[2016–17 Liverpool F.C. season|the 2016–17 campaign]]. He scored his first goal of the season on 23 August 2016 in a 5–0 [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3755142/Burton-0-5-Liverpool-Divock-Origi-Daniel-Sturridge-Roberto-Firmino-score-EFL-Cup.html|title=Burton 0–5 Liverpool: Divock Origi, Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge find the back of the net as Reds ease into EFL Cup third round|website=Daily Mail|last=King|first=Dominic|date=23 August 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first [[2016–17 Premier League]] goal on 26 November, coming off the bench for the injured [[Philippe Coutinho]] to score the opener in a 2–0 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/26/premier-league-clockwatch-liverpool-vs-sunderland-rest-3pm-kick/|title=Liverpool 2 Sunderland 0: Divock Origi provides relief after Philippe Coutinho is stretchered off|website=Telegraph|last=Findon|first=Ben|date=26 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season: Loan to VfL Wolfsburg====
On 31 August 2017, [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] announced the signing of Origi on a season-long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vfl-wolfsburg.de/en/info/news/detailspage/artikel/welkom-divock-origi-47146.html|title=Welkom, Divock Origi! |website=vfl-wolfsburg.de|date=31 August 2017|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpools-divock-origi-joins-wolfsburg-in-6m-season-long/13zpa1prlvhfw1k7zy6spcfxkw|title=Liverpool's Divock Origi joins Wolfsburg in £6m season-long loan deal {{!}} Goal.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season: Return to Liverpool====
On 2 December, Origi scored his first goal of the season in [[Merseyside derby|a derby match]] against city rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], which Liverpool won 1&amp;ndash;0. Origi came on as a substitute for [[Roberto Firmino]] in the 84th minute and scored with a header in the 96th minute, capitalising on an error from Everton goalkeeper [[Jordan Pickford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/328060-match-report-liverpool-everton|title=Origi saves the day{{!}}|date=2 December 2018|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Origi has represented Belgium at [[Belgium national youth football team|under-15]], [[Belgium national youth football team|under-16]], [[Belgium national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Belgium national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He scored ten goals while in the under-19 team, the first in a [[2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification]] match against [[Belarus national under-19 football team|Belarus]] on 12 October 2012.

The [[Football Kenya Federation]] expressed an interest in persuading Origi to play for the [[Kenya national football team|Kenya senior national team]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2013/02/04/3726151/kenya-fa-reveal-they-will-lure-striker-divock-origi-to-play?ICID=HP_MR_2 |title=Kenya FA reveal they will lure striker Divock Origi to play for Harambee Stars |date=4 February 2013 |first=David |last=Kwalimwa |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208060847/http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2013/02/04/3726151/kenya-fa-reveal-they-will-lure-striker-divock-origi-to-play?ICID=HP_MR_2 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 13 May 2014, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium senior national team]] manager [[Marc Wilmots]] announced Origi would be part of the 23-man squad representing Belgium at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27395150 |title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |archivedate=1 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141133/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27395150 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origi came on as a substitute for [[Romelu Lukaku]] in the 58th minute of the opening [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]] game against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Belo Horizonte]] on 17 June. In Belgium's second match, again after coming on as a substitute for Lukaku, he scored his first senior international goal in the 88th minute of a 1–0 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] to qualify the ''Red Devils'' for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242 |title=Belgium v Russia |first=Graham |last=Chase |date=22 June 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |archivedate=8 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708204715/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, at 19 years, 2 months and 4 days, he became the youngest goalscorer of the tournament (until [[United States national men's soccer team|American]] winger [[Julian Green]] scored against Belgium during their [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Belgium vs United States|round of 16 match]]), the youngest goalscorer in Belgian World Cup history, and the first player of Kenyan origin to score at a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2105895-divock-origis-late-goal-for-belgium-defeats-russia |title=Divock Origi's Late Goal for Belgium Defeats Russia |publisher=Bleacher Report |first=Sean |last=Swaby |date=22 June 2014 |accessdate=22 June 2014 |archivedate=10 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710225439/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2105895-divock-origis-late-goal-for-belgium-defeats-Russia |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances, he was named the Young Talent of the 2014 [[Belgian Sportsman of the year]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4522/kenya/2014/12/16/7122662/origi-scoops-belgiums-award-for-most-promising-youngster|title=Lille loanee Divock Origi has won Belgium’s award for most Promising Youngster of the Year 2014 as Liverpool summer signing continues to impress|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
