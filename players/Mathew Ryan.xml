Ryan played for the Central Coast Mariners youth team in the [[2009–10 Central Coast Mariners FC season|2009–10 season]], and after several call-ups to the senior team, he was given a 3-year senior contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goalweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=663:ryan-playing-for-keeps&amp;catid=61:central-coast-mariners-fc&amp;Itemid=87 |title=Ryan playing for keeps |date=11 February 2010 |publisher=goalweekly.com |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite starting the [[2010–11 A-League]] as the Mariners' substitute keeper, an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]] to first-choice [[Jess Vanstrattan]] saw Ryan elevated into the starting eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com.au/news/vanstrattan-out-for-a-year-230195 |title=Vanstrattan out for a year |website=FourFourTwo |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made his [[A-League]] debut for the Mariners on 28 August 2010 in a 1–1 draw against [[Sydney FC]], but fumbled a cross which allowed [[Rhyan Grant]] to score Sydney's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-28/mariners-steal-draw-against-sky-blues/961514 |title=Mariners steal draw against Sky Blues |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=27 September 2017 |date=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While coach [[Graham Arnold]] was happy with Ryan's debut, there was competition between Ryan and newly-signed [[Paul Henderson (footballer)|Paul Henderson]] for the regular starting spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportalnz.gearbox.performgroup.com/football/news/mariners'-gk-quandry/1966dsahf2i6k19b1f06o24usb |title=Mariners' GK quandry |publisher=Sportal |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several months Ryan retained his spot in the starting lineup and earned significant plaudits, including the A-League Young Player of the Month award for December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/ten-clean-sheets-and-an-official-rap-give-ryan-cup-legup-20110110-19l6y |title=Ten clean sheets and an official rap give Ryan Cup leg-up |author=Hassett, Sebastian |date=11 January 2011 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mariners season ended with a penalty shootout loss to [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]] in the [[2011 A-League Grand Final]], however, Ryan was awarded the [[Joe Marston Medal]] for man of the match in that game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-sport/roar-grab-aleague-title-with-dramatic-win-20110313-1bss6.html |title=Roar grab A-League title with dramatic win |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Clark, Laine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named [[A-League Young Footballer of the Year]] for 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2011/03/06/flores-takes-top-gong |website=The World Game |date=6 March 2011 |title=Flores takes top gong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2015, Ryan signed a six-year deal with [[La Liga]] side [[Valencia CF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.valenciacf.com/ver/42131/vcf-official-statement-.html |title=VCF Official Statement |publisher=Valencia's official website |date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was expected to assume the starting goalkeeper role, at least in the medium term, with regular starter [[Diego Alves]] out with an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/07/22/socceroos-star-ryan-signs-six-year-valencia-deal |title=Socceroos star Ryan signs six-year Valencia deal |website=The World Game |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his unofficial debut in a friendly against [[PSV Eindhoven]] on 25 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the-afc.com/australia-asian-cup-2019-2018-world-cup/ryan-makes-impressive-valencia-debut-in-win-over-psv |title=Ryan makes impressive Valencia debut in win over PSV Eindhoven |publisher=Asian Football Confederation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2015, Ryan made his [[La Liga]] debut in Valencia's opening game of the season, keeping a clean sheet in a scoreless draw with [[Rayo Vallecano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/08/23/ryan-keeps-clean-sheet-la-liga-debut |title=Ryan keeps clean sheet on La Liga debut |website=The World Game |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His run in the starting side extended until September, when he sustained a [[tear of meniscus|meniscus tear]] in a draw with [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], forcing him to have surgery and miss over a month of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/valencia/story/2591786/valencia-goalkeeper-mathew-ryan-sidelined-with-knee-injury |author=Garcia, Adriana |website=ESPN FC |date=1 September 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |title=Mathew Ryan out for Valencia with knee injury after surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of good performances from his replacement, [[Jaume Domènech]], led to suggestions that Ryan would not return to the starting side after his return from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/can-mat-ryan-displace-form-spaniard-valencia |title=Can Mat Ryan displace in-form Spaniard at Valencia? |publisher=Football Federation Australia |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Greco, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not until late November that Ryan was re-promoted to the starting side for a game against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deportevalenciano.com/2015/11/29/nuno-sienta-jaume-coloca-ryan-titular-sevilla |language=Spanish |title=Nuno sienta a Jaume y coloca a Ryan como titular ante el Sevilla |author=Ballester, Nacho|trans-title=Nuno benches Jaume and makes Ryan the starter against Sevilla |publisher=Deporte Valenciano |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan continued to be rotated with Jaume and the returning Alves for the remainder of the season, eventually making 21 appearances for Valencia in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/socceroos-goalkeeper-mat-ryan-opens-up-about-his-rollercoaster-year-with-spanish-giant-valencia/news-story/ae2b41b77f7e0ac0aed9803d67b75e9a |title=Socceroos goalkeeper Mat Ryan opens up about his rollercoaster year with Spanish giant Valencia |author=Davutovic, David |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was back in Valencia's starting lineup for the opening matches of the [[2016–17 La Liga]], with Alves rumored to be seeking an overseas move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/08/28/ryan-impresses-valencia-go-down |title=Ryan impresses but Valencia go down |website=The World Game |date=28 August 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alves stayed at Valencia and Ryan subsequently lost his starting position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/11/13/ryan-considering-valencia-options |title=Ryan considering Valencia options |website=The World Game |date=13 November 2016 |accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2017, a number of clubs were interested in Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2016/11/13/ryan-considering-valencia-options |title=Ryan considering Valencia options |publisher=Goal.com |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017 |author=Huguenin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Racing Genk====
On 30 January 2017, Ryan returned to Belgium after he was loaned to [[K.R.C. Genk|Racing Genk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/01/30/ryan-leaves-valencia-genk |title=Ryan leaves Valencia for Genk |first=Dave |last=Lewis |website=The World Game |publisher=Special Broadcasting Service |date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the starting squad straight away, playing his first match in a 1–0 loss to [[K.V.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 16 June 2017, it was announced that Ryan would sign for newly-promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 1 July 2017 on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/mat-ryan-joins-new-boys-brighton-and-hove-albion-on-record-fee-20170616-gwt1am.html |title=Mat Ryan joins new boys Brighton and Hove Albion on record fee |first=Alan |last=Baldwin |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the prospect of playing in the Premier League as a main reason for the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/07/22/ryan-reveals-why-he-traded-valencia-brighton |author=Micallef, Philip |title=Ryan reveals why he traded Valencia for Brighton |website=The World Game |date=22 July 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made his debut for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 12 August 2017 against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/match/brighton-hove-albion-v-manchester-city/90r9vov8c2la34s83h1q7lcoa |title=Brighton and Hove Albion 0 Manchester City 2: Ruthless Aguero makes the difference for Guardiola |first=Matthew |last=Scott |publisher=Goal.com |date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth===
Despite not having featured for the side previously, Ryan's strong form in the [[2010–11 A-League]] led to suggestions he would be called up for the [[Australia national under-20 soccer team|Australian under-20 team]] for the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/912187/ten-clean-sheets-and-an-official-rap-give-ryan-cup-leg-up/?cs=7 |title=Ten clean sheets and an official rap give Ryan Cup leg-up |author=Hassett, Sebastian |newspaper=Central Western Daily |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he missed the tournament after suffering a serious knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2011/07/19/ryan-back-at-training/ |title=Ryan back at training |publisher=NBN Television |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928060511/http://media.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2011/07/19/ryan-back-at-training/|archive-date=28 September 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was first called up for the [[Australia national under-23 soccer team|Australian under-23 side]] in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/mat-ryan-among-new-olyroos-faces/news-story/da19ba10a58415570dc723f1187750a8 |title=Mat Ryan among new Olyroos faces |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the side in a scoreless draw with [[Iraq national under-23 football team|Iraq]] on 22 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://under23s.footballaustralia.com.au/article/qantas-australian-under-23s-draw-with-iraq/api125f3d7b81rwl0fsf2u1sh |title=Qantas Australian Under 23s draw with Iraq |publisher=Football Federation Australia |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217194204/http://under23s.footballaustralia.com.au/article/qantas-australian-under-23s-draw-with-iraq/api125f3d7b81rwl0fsf2u1sh |archivedate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olyroos failed to qualify for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4023/other-australian-football/2012/02/23/2922948/united-arab-emirates-1-0-australia-olyroos-out-of-london |title=United Arab Emirates 1–0 Australia: Olyroos out of London 2012 Olympics |publisher=Goal.com |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |author=Higgs, Paddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
[[File:Mathew Ryan, Asian Cup 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Ryan with Australia at the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]]]]
Ryan received his first call-up to the [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] squad for a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/osieck-mixes-old-heads-new-faces/1279523/ |title=Osieck mixes old heads with new faces |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |author=Jones, Quinn |newspaper=The Northern Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was selected in the squad for the second preliminary round of the [[2013 EAFF East Asian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.myfootball.com.au/news/osieck-finalises-east-asian-cup-squad |title=Osieck finalises East Asian Cup squad |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |publisher=Football Federation Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior international debut in a 1–1 draw with [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] on 5 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-06/socceroos-held-by-north-korea/4411612 |title=Socceroos held by North Korea |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, longtime Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] announced his international retirement following the appointment of new coach [[Ange Postecoglou]], leaving Ryan as one of the contenders to be the new first-choice keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/mark-schwarzer-retires-from-socceroos-20131105-2x06m.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 November 2013 |author=Hassett, Sebastian |accessdate=28 September 2017 |title=Mark Schwarzer retires from Socceroos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postecoglou identified Ryan and fellow young keeper [[Mitch Langerak]] as two of the main candidates for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://matildas.footballaustralia.com.au/news/ryan-langerak-leading-contenders-replace-schwarzer |title=Ryan, Langerak leading contenders to replace Schwarzer |publisher=Football Federation Australia |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan was selected in May 2014 in the Australian squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/sport/alex-wilkinson-named-in-the-socceroos-final-23-man-squad-for-the-world-cup-in-brazil/news-story/e7d2f3d848a63401c5e960158d4adcc1 |title=Alex Wilkinson named in the Socceroos final 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=Sydney |author=Connellan, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in all three of Australia's games as they were eliminated in the group stage after losses to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Ryan's own performances in the tournament were mixed, and he described the matches as a "massive learning curve" for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/australia-2014/mat-ryan-admits-world-cup-has-been-a-tough-learning-ground-20140624-zsjty.html |title=Mat Ryan admits World Cup has been a tough learning ground |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Hassett, Sebastian |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, Ryan was selected for the Australian [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] squad, to be played in Australia in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2014/12/23/socceroos-squad-includes-mix-talent-asian-cup |title=Socceroos squad includes mix of talent for Asian Cup |website=The World Game |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put in a number of strong performances throughout the tournament as Australia conceded just two goals in reaching the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup Final|Final]] against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2015/01/29/ryan-spurred-socceroos-asian-cup-heartbreak |title=Ryan spurred on by Socceroos' Asian Cup heartbreak |website=The World Game |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia claimed their first [[AFC Asian Cup]] title after winning 2–1 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-31/australia-socceroos-win-asian-cup/6060038 |title=Asian Cup: Australia wins first title with 2–1 extra-time win over South Korea thanks to James Troisi and Massimo Luongo goals |publisher=ABC News |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was named the official Best Goalkeeper for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mundodosguardaredes.pt/mathew-ryan-vence-afc-asian-cup-2015-e/ |title=Mathew Ryan vence AFC Asian Cup 2015 e Best Goalkeeper Award pela Austrália|trans-title=Mathew Ryan wins AFC Asian Cup 2015 and Best Goalkeeper Award with Australia |publisher=MundoDosGuardaredes.pt |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Australia's 23-man [[Australia national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb |title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Standing just over 183&amp;nbsp;cm tall (6&amp;nbsp;ft), Ryan is not regarded as being particularly tall for a goalkeeper, but he is confident, well-built and agile. Ryan is a strong and assured goalkeeper who makes up for his relative lack of height with a muscular build that ensures that he fills his goal. Ryan is positionally sound, but also not afraid to come off his line and communicates well with the defenders. Ryan's biggest asset is his accurate ball distribution by hand and foot over a range of distances.&lt;ref name="ryanready"/&gt;
