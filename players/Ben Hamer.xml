==Career==
===Early career===
Hamer was born in [[Chard, Somerset]] and is a [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date= 11 September 2012 | url= http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/Sport.cfm?id=31431&amp;headline=Ben | title= Ben Hamer can't wait for Charlton derby test | work= southlondon-today.co.uk/Sport | accessdate= 11 September 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131216005849/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/Sport.cfm?id=31431&amp;headline=Ben | archivedate= 16 December 2013 | df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to Germany at the age of 3 and, consequently, he is a fluent German speaker. However, when he was 8, his family came back to England. He attended Holyrood Community School in Chard which is near to his birthplace. His footballing ability led to a spell playing for [[Somerset]] at county level, where he was spotted by a Reading scout. He signed for Reading at the age of 15.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Reading===

On 1 August 2011, Hamer joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on a three-year contract and was immediately handed the number one jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10267~2406920,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919062441/http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10267~2406920%2C00.html |archivedate=19 September 2011 |title=Keeper captured |date=1 August 2011 |publisher=Charlton Athletic F.C. |accessdate=30 June 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 August 2011 against his former club Reading in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] first round and helped Charlton to a 2&amp;nbsp;– 1 win.

After several weeks of strong speculation about Hamer's move to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], it was finally confirmed on 22 May 2014, by Hamer himself on social media. Hamer says he made the move to the newly promoted Foxes for the chance to play Premier League football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/BenHamer21/status/469488874109284352|title=Delighted To Have Joined @OfficialFoxes|author= |date=22 May 2014 |work= |publisher=Ben Hamer|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at home to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in a [[Football League Cup|Capital One Cup]] second round tie.

He played his second game for Leicester against Premier League champions, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 0–1 home defeat on 13 December. After playing 7 games for Leicester, Hamer lost his place when on 6 January 2015, Leicester signed experienced goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to help cover for the injured [[Kasper Schmeichel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/leicester-city-sign-mark-schwarzer-2186274.aspx|title=Leicester City Sign Mark Schwarzer|publisher=Leicester City F.C.|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016–17 season, Hamer started Leicester's sixth Champions League group game, giving him his Champions League debut.
