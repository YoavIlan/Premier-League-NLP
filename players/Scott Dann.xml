'''Scott Dann''' (born 14 February 1987) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He began his [[Football League]] career with [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], before moving on to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and then to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2009. After Birmingham's relegation from the Premier League, Dann joined Blackburn in August 2011 and was the club's captain.

==Early life==
Dann was born in [[Liverpool]], Merseyside,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and attended Archbishop Beck High School in the [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] district of the city. He is a former [[Liverpool F.C.]] season ticket holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-considering-move-birmingham-3375863 |title=Liverpool FC considering move for Birmingham City defender Scott Dann |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Walsall===
Dann joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in 2003 as a junior after impressing on trial at the [[Bescot Stadium]], signing a professional contract with the Saddlers the following year. He moved up the ranks at Walsall to become a regular in the reserve team throughout 2004–05 and was allowed to join Danish side [[Køge BK]] on loan towards the end of the campaign.

Dann then joined [[Conference North]] side [[Redditch United F.C.|Redditch United]] on loan in October 2005 initially until the end of the season, but he was recalled in January 2006. He then Joined Redditch's league rivals [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]] on loan following injuries to their regular centre-backs Richard Teesdale and Ian Wright. He played in three games for the Pitmen, against [[Hucknall Town F.C.|Hucknall Town]], [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]] and [[Lancaster City F.C.|Lancaster City]], before injury put an end to his loan spell at [[Keys Park]]. He returned to Walsall and was put on a short-term contract for the 2006–07 season, where he earned his place in the starting line-up with a number of excellent performances at the back. His season was ended in March 2007 after picking up a metatarsal injury in the game against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].

As reward for his outstanding season for the Saddlers, who were promoted as League Two Champions, Dann was given a three-year contract to commit him to the club and to ward off interest from a number of clubs higher up in the league.

===Coventry City===
His form in League One was equally as impressive as the previous season, so it was little surprise that in January 2008 Dann joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for an undisclosed fee, suggested in the media to be "in excess of £1 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scott-dann-follows-fox-to-coventry-57533 |title=Scott Dann follows Fox to Coventry from Walsall |first=Brian |last=Halford |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His impressive form for the Saddlers continued in the Championship for the Sky Blues alongside former Walsall teammate [[Daniel Fox (footballer)|Daniel Fox]], who had also moved to the [[Ricoh Arena]]. He helped the club narrowly avoid relegation. The England set-up had seen enough in Dann and Fox to decide they were ready to make the step up to international level, with both players making their U-21 debuts in March 2008 against Poland at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]].

Dann was appointed [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of Coventry City for the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/scott-dann-named-coventry-city-3093103 |title=Scott Dann is named Coventry City captain |first=Andy |last=Turner |newspaper=Coventry Telegraph |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birmingham City===

Dann signed for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 12 June 2009 for an undisclosed fee, described as a "club record fee for a defender";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301133632/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~1691106,00.html |title=It's a Dann deal! |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=12 June 2009 |archivedate=1 March 2012 |url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~1691106,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; local press reports suggested the fee to be in the region of £3.5&amp;nbsp;million, with a possible increase to £4&amp;nbsp;million, with performance-based add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/35m-scott-dann-given-premier-3944396 |title=£3.5m Scott Dann given Premier choice |work=Birmingham Post |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013 |first=Robert |last=Tanner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/alex-mcleish-tracked-scott-dann-3081475 |title=Alex McLeish had tracked Scott Dann 'long term' |work=Coventry Telegraph |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/scott-dann-fee-rise-4m-3081703 |title=Scott Dann fee may rise to £4m? |work=Coventry Telegraph |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery during the summer and then a pulled thigh muscle meant Dann was not fully match fit when an injury to [[Franck Queudrue]] gave him the chance to make his [[Premier League]] debut on 19 September at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-fit-again-scott-dann-103473 |title=Fit-again Scott Dann ready to step into line of fire at Hull City |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham won 1–0, and Dann played well and retained his place in the starting eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-citys-scott-dann-can-247667 |title=Birmingham City's Scott Dann can blossom next season |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Sunday Mercury |location=Birmingham |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2012 |quote=Due to injury, he had to wait his turn. But when Dann was pressed into action at Hull City despite not being fit or really up to speed&amp;nbsp;– he played a debut blinder and the rest is history.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas 2009, ''[[The Times]]''' [[Patrick Barclay]] described Dann and defensive partner [[Roger Johnson (footballer)|Roger Johnson]] as "certainties" for his team of the season so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12CD3BE4CDF8E398&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Polished duo Roger Johnson and Scott Dann put case for the defence |first=Patrick |last=Barclay |newspaper=The Times |date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for Birmingham came against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 13 February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8506578.stm |title=Derby 1–2 Birmingham |first=David |last=Ornstein |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a run of 15 games unbeaten in all competitions, including a club record 12 unbeaten in the top flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1157547.html |title=Fresh fortunes at St Andrew's |publisher=FIFA |date= 15 January 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/colin-tattum-analyses-the-way-ahead-247665 |title=Colin Tattum analyses the way ahead for Birmingham City |first=Colin |last=Tattum |newspaper=Sunday Mercury |location=Birmingham |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A calf injury sustained in training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329235859/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2034804,00.html |title=McLeish: We didn't deserve that |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=25 April 2010 |archivedate=29 March 2012|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2034804,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused him to miss the last three games of the season as the club finished in ninth place, their best for more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8656538.stm |title= Bolton 2–1 Birmingham |first=Les |last=Roopanarine |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dann scored the opening goal as Birmingham beat a [[Hong Kong League XI|Hong Kong XI]] 3–2 in an invitation match branded the Xtep Cup, part of the club's 2010 pre-season tour of the Far East,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/720088/city-match-finishes-black-say-organisers |title=City match finishes in black, say organisers |last=Chan Kin-wa |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first Premier League goal, a header from a [[Sebastian Larsson]] cross, on the opening weekend of the 2010–11 season as Birmingham drew 2–2 away at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8901729.stm |title=Sunderland 2–2 Birmingham |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following surgery on a hamstring damaged in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] semi-final in January 2011, Dann was ruled out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/9363414.stm |title=Birmingham's Scott Dann ruled out for rest of season |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the season.
