'''Robert Brady''' (born 14 January 1992) is an Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] and a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Brady began his career in the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United academy]]. However, after featuring just once for United's first team, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] initially on loan and then permanently in 2013. He made 124 appearances for the ''Tigers'', helping them reach the [[2014 FA Cup Final]]. In July 2015, he joined Norwich City for £7&amp;nbsp;million where he suffered relegation to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] with the club in 2016. He returned to the Premier League where he became Burnley's record signing in January 2017 when he completed a transfer for a fee reported to be around £13&amp;nbsp;million.

Brady has represented Ireland at all youth levels. After becoming their highest under-21 scorer of all time with seven goals, Brady made his senior international debut against [[Oman national football team|Oman]] in 2012, scoring and setting up two more goals in a 4–1 victory. He has earned over 30 caps for his country and represented them at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], scoring two goals during the tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Baldoyle]], Dublin, Brady attended [[Pobalscoil Neasáin]] and was part of their under-16 All-Ireland Championship winning team. He was spotted by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] scouts while playing for St. Kevin's Boys, and joined the club's academy shortly after his 16th birthday in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/who-robbie-brady-everything-you-8159139|title=Who is Robbie Brady?

In July 2008, Brady signed on as an academy scholar, and cemented his place in the under-18s throughout the following two seasons, as well as playing for the reserves. In the 2010–11 season, Brady graduated to the reserve team on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="goal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/slideshow/3712/1/the-five-best-young-irish-players|title=The five best young Irish players – Robbie Brady|publisher=Goal.com|date=28 May 2013|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as an unused substitute for the first team's [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] Fourth Round win at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 26 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/9059505.stm|title=Man Utd 3–2 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Jonathan|last=Stevenson|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his only appearance for Manchester United on 26 September 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for [[Alexander Büttner]] in a 2–1 victory over Newcastle United in the third round of the League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19645229|title=Man Utd 2–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Alistair|last=Magowan|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/brady-forced-to-bide-time-despite-making-competitive-united-debut-3242046.html|title=Brady forced to bide time despite making competitive United debut|work=Irish Independent|first=Daniel|last=McDonnell|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Brady 23-07-11 1.png|thumb|Brady playing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in 2011]]

On 19 July 2011, Manchester United [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] Brady to Championship club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Jul/brady-joins-hull.aspx|title=Brady joins Tigers on loan|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|first=Adam|last=Marshall|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first match of the season on 5 August 2011 at the [[KCOM Stadium|KC Stadium]] in a 1–0 defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14337494|title=Hull 0–1 Blackpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal for the ''Tigers'' in a 1–0 win against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the KC Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~2434153,00.html |title=Tigers Net First Home Win |publisher=Hull City A.F.C. |date=27 August 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830122057/http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10338~2434153%2C00.html |archivedate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was extended until the end of the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12]] season on 5 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16431262|title=Manchester United's Robbie Brady to stay at Hull City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January, Brady scored in a 1–0 win against Reading at the [[Madejski Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/16559464|title=Reading 0–1 Hull|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2012|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2012, Manchester United loaned Brady to Hull until 2 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Dec/michael-keane-and-jesse-lingard-rejoin-leicester.aspx|title=Reds trio extend loan deals|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|first=Adam|last=Marshall|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench the following day against Wolverhampton Wanderers as a replacement for [[Liam Rosenior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20134322|title=Hull City 2–1 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brady scored his first goal since returning to Hull on 8 December 2012 against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]; he scored with a 25-yard [[Direct free kick|free kick]] that went in off the crossbar, making it 2–0 to Hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20564877|title=Watford 1–2 Hull City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 December 2012|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2013, Brady was signed by Hull on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2013/Jan/robbie-brady-completes-permanent-move-to-hull-city.aspx|title=Brady completes Tigers switch|publisher=Manchester United F.C.|first=Gemma|last=Thompson|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady scored a first-half [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in Hull's opening home [[Premier League]] match on 24 August 2013, giving them a 1–0 win against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23736895|title=Hull 1–0 Norwich|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2013|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score two more goals in the Premier League the following month. He then underwent two separate groin operations which made him miss most of the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2575934/Robbie-Brady-injured-season-groin-operation.html|title=Hull midfielder Brady ruled out for the season after second groin operation|newspaper=Daily Mail|first=Colin|last=Young|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady opened his [[2016–17 Norwich City F.C. season|2016–17]] goalscoring account on 1 October 2016 with a stunning 25-yard strike in the 2–1 away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/other-soccer/irelands-robbie-brady-scores-absolute-stunner-as-norwich-pip-wolves-35095910.html|title=Ireland's Robbie Brady scores absolute stunner as Norwich pip Wolves|work=Irish Independent|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He doubled his goal tally for the season on 5 November, opening the scoring in a 3–2 home defeat to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37807991|title=Norwich City 2–3 Leeds United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December, Brady was [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Red card (dismissal)|sent off]] in the 0–0 draw at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in a controversial decision with manager [[Alex Neil (footballer)|Alex Neil]] saying: "Robbie clearly isn't going in to injure the lad and both of them are sliding at impact, but we're not getting the rub of the green right now and that's just another example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38424342|title=Brentford 0–0 Norwich City|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Gary|last=Smee|date=31 December 2016|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwich appealed the red card shown to Brady but it was rejected, meaning the Irishman would miss the next three matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canaries.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/norwich-city-robbie-brady-appeal-3495194.aspx|title=Robbie Brady's Brentford Red Card Upheld|publisher=Norwich City F.C.|date=2 January 2017|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the side for a 1–0 defeat by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 18 January 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38579247|title=Southampton 1–0 Norwich City|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Jonathan|last=Jurjeko|date=18 January 2017|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored a penalty in the following league match, a 3–1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38619163|title=Norwich City 3–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2017|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January, he made his final appearance for Norwich in a 2–0 win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], registering an assist for a [[Timm Klose]] goal just before half-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38700814|title=Norwich City 2–0 Birmingham City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 January 2017|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
