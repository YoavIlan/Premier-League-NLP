==Early life==
Brown was born in [[Peterborough]], Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref name="Hugman"/&gt;

==Club career==
===West Bromwich Albion===
On 2 March 2013, Brown made the [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] bench for the first time in an away league match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], an unused substitute as West Brom lost 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea 1–0 West Brom|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/345614/statistics.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2013, again Brown made the bench and was again not used as West Brom lost 2–1 to Arsenal at [[The Hawthorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Brom 1–2 Arsenal|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/345575/statistics.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown made his debut for West Bromwich Albion on 4 May 2013 in a 3–2 home [[Premier League]] defeat by [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], replacing [[Youssouf Mulumbu]] for the last four minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Brom 2–3 Wigan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22320485|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming the second-youngest player in Premier League history at the age of 16 years and 117 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday Sundae: West Brom throw Brown boy in the ring|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/04/saturday-sundae-west-brom-isaiah-brown|publisher=guardian.co.uk|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2013, West Bromwich Albion rejected an offer for Brown from Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albion reject Chelsea offer for Brown|url=http://www.wba.co.uk/news/article/albion-reject-chelsea-offer-for-brown-902287.aspx|publisher=wba.co.uk|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Chelsea confirmed that they had signed Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaiah Brown|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/academy-article/article/3326285|publisher=chelseafc.com|accessdate=27 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921032122/http://www.chelseafc.com/academy-article/article/3326285|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compensation between the clubs reportedly set to be decided by a tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribunal will settle West Brom's Isaiah Brown cash tussle|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/2013/07/26/tribunal-will-settle-west-broms-isaiah-brown-cash-tussle/|publisher=expressandstar.com|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Brown left the club West Brom's chairman considered scrapping the club's category one development academy as the [[Elite Player Performance Plan|EPPP]] rules Chelsea used to sign Brown meant that the club were losing their best prospects for nominal fees that failed to cover the cost of running an academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/2013/07/02/jeremy-peace-could-scrap-west-brom-academy/ |title=Jeremy Peace could scrap West Brom academy|work=Express &amp; Star |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown scored his first goals for the Chelsea first team on 16 July 2014 in a 5–0 pre-season friendly victory over [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/07/16/photo-chelsea-wonderkid-izzy-brown-celebrates-first-chelsea-goal/ |title=Chelsea wonderkid Izzy Brown celebrates first Chelsea goals v Wycombe|publisher=Hereisthecity.com |date=2014-07-16 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2014, Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] said that he should be blamed if Brown were not to become a senior [[England national football team|England]] international under his management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Todd |first=Oliver |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2709249/Jose-Mourinho-says-Chelsea-kids-Lewis-Baker-Izzy-Brown-Dominic-Solanke-dont-play-England-blame-ME.html |title=Jose Mourinho says if Chelsea kids Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke don't play for England, 'blame me!|work=Daily Mail |date=2014-07-29 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October, Brown made the Chelsea bench for the first time in a competitive fixture, but was an unused substitute as Chelsea beat [[Shrewsbury Town]] 2–1 to advance into quarter-finals of the League Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29699744 |title=Shrewsbury Town 1–2 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |date=27 October 2014 |accessdate=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2015, Brown made the Chelsea bench against current league title holders, Manchester City, but was again an unused substitute as Chelsea drew 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Chelsea 1–1 Man City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30963477|accessdate=31 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the match, on 3 February, Brown was promoted into Mourinho's first team squad alongside fellow teenager [[Ruben Loftus-Cheek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Izzy Brown promoted to Chelsea's first team|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2015/2/3/7971887/ruben-loftus-cheek-izzy-brown-chelsea-fc-first-team|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=SB Nations|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Academy graduates in first team squad|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/02/more-academy-graduates-in-first-team-squad.html|accessdate=3 February 2015 |work=Chelseafc.com|date=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April, Brown was named on the first team bench for the third time that season for a West London derby against [[Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higginson |first=Marc |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32187758 |title=Queens Park Rangers 0–1 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 24 hours later he captained Chelsea U19 in the final of the 2014–15 [[UEFA Youth League]] against [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] in Switzerland and put in a man of the match performance scoring twice to help Chelsea take the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000561/match=2016409/postmatch/report/index.html#brown+inspires+chelsea+youth+league+glory |title=Brown inspires Chelsea to Youth League glory|publisher=UEFA.com |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May, Brown made his Chelsea debut, coming off the bench for [[Loïc Rémy]] for the final eleven minutes of a 3–0 defeat at his former club West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32686137|last=|first=|title=West Brom 3–0 Chelsea|date=18 May 2015|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brown only made one league appearances out of the whole season, [[José Mourinho]] stated that he would receive a winner's medal for his contributions this season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/chelsea/story/2450893/jose-mourinho-every-chelsea-player-to-get-prem-medal |title=Every Chelsea player to get a Premier League medal says Jose Mourinho|work=ESPN FC |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitesse (loan)====
On 10 July 2015, Chelsea agreed to a deal that will see Brown go on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to Dutch side [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]] along with new signing [[Nathan Allan de Souza|Nathan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/07/brown-and-nathan-in-dutch-loan.html |title=Brown and Nathan in Dutch loan |accessdate=10 July 2015 |publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Brown made his debut and played for the entire first half in a friendly 1–0 win against the Turkish side [[Çaykur Rizespor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vitesse.nl/nl/nieuws/detail/5113/vitesse-verslaat-rizespor-in-seekirchen-1-0 |title=Vitesse verslaat Rizespor in Seekirchen: 1–0 |language=Dutch |accessdate=18 July 2015 |date=17 July 2015 |publisher=Vitesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut 13 days later in a [[UEFA Europa League]] third qualifying round first leg against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at [[St. Mary's Stadium|St. Mary's]], playing the full 90 minutes of a 3–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Adam|title=Southampton 3–0 Vitesse|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33667103|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2016, Brown scored his first senior goal, giving Vitesse the lead in the 34th minute in their 2–1 victory over [[Roda JC Kerkrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Roda JC Kerkrade vs. Vitesse (1 : 2) |url=https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/roda-jc-kerkrade-vs-vitesse-overview-36-431944?period=FullTime&amp;variable=g3 |publisher=OneFootball |date=6 March 2016 |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618142538/https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/roda-jc-kerkrade-vs-vitesse-overview-36-431944?period=FullTime&amp;variable=g3 |archive-date=18 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rotherham United (loan)====
On 15 August 2016, Brown joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on loan until the end of the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millers complete Brown deal|url=http://www.themillers.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/rotherham-united-chelsea-izzy-brown-3249823.aspx|publisher=Rotherham United F.C.|date=15 August 2016|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August 2016, Brown made his debut in a 1–0 victory over [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotherham United 1–0 Brentford|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37067355|work=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2016, Brown scored his first goal after the opening six minutes of a 2–2 draw against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37263311 |title=Rotherham United 2–2 Bristol City |date=10 September 2016 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huddersfield Town (loan)====
It was announced later that day that Brown had joined fellow Championship side [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on loan for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea send Izzy Brown on loan to Huddersfield Town after cutting short season-long spell at Rotherham United |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4095008/Chelsea-send-Izzy-Brown-loan-Huddersfield-Town-cutting-short-season-long-spell-Rotherham-United.html|website=Daily Mail|last=Todd|first=Oliver|date=6 January 2017|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 January 2017, Brown made his Huddersfield debut in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], which resulted in a 4–0 victory for the Championship side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Huddersfield Town 4–0 Port Vale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38475367 |work=BBC Sport |date=7 January 2017 |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Brown scored his first goal for Huddersfield in a 2–0 victory against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], netting in the 41st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Huddersfield Town 2–0 Ipswich Town |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38619009 |work=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2017 |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2017, Brown scored for Huddersfield with his first touch after coming on as a first half substitute in Huddersfield's 2–1 win in a [[West Yorkshire derby]] against rivals [[Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/izzy-browns-chelsea-pedigree-is-clear-to-see-at-huddersfield-says-noel-whelan/897402#aCZ8ZghxMGsLM47k.97|title=Izzy Brown's Chelsea pedigree is clear to see at Huddersfield, says Noel Whelan|publisher=Squawka|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown scored five Championship goals for Huddersfield throughout his loan spell at the club, and was linked with a permanent move in the summer following their promotion to the Premier League, however such a move failed to materialise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/06/19/huddersfield-advanced-talks-chelsea-8m-izzy-brown-signing/|title=Huddersfield in advanced talks with Chelsea over £8m Izzy Brown signing|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|work=John Percy|date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
