'''Theo James Walcott''' (born 16 March 1989) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Everton}} club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Walcott is a product of the [[Southampton F.C. Academy|Southampton Academy]] and started his career with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] before joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for £5&amp;nbsp;million in 2006. His speedy pace and ball crossing led his manager [[Arsène Wenger]] to deploy him on the [[Forward (association football)#Winger|wing]] for most of his career. Walcott has been played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] since the [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13 season]] when he was Arsenal's top scorer,&lt;ref name="Reading 301012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kickoff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=1&amp;season=2012&amp;area=squad|title=Arsenal Statistics 2012/13|publisher=KickOff.co.uk|access-date=30 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101190400/http://www.kickoff.co.uk/teams/?team_id=1&amp;season=2012&amp;area=squad|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has scored more than 100 goals for the club.&lt;ref name=AFCProfile/&gt;

On 30 May 2006, Walcott became England's youngest ever senior football player aged 17 years and 75 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson|first=Steve|title=The kids are alright: Football's youngest ever |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3115222/The-kids-are-alright-Footballs-youngest-ever.html#|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=16 June 2012|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, he received the [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name=BBCAward/&gt; On 6 September 2008, he made his first competitive start in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], and in the following match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a [[hat-trick]] for England. He has represented England at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] and has 47 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s, scoring eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theo Walcott|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/W/Theo-Walcott |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Walcott was born to a black [[British Jamaican]] father and a white English mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Don Walcott, father of Theo, is the British-born son of Jamaican parents |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London | url= http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/64555| date = 4 October 2008|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up as a [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fan due to his father's support of Liverpool. When Chelsea asked him to be a ball boy, he used the opportunity to meet his Liverpool idols:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was playing in a tournament for Swindon when Southampton and Chelsea showed an interest. Chelsea invited me to be a [[ball boy|ball-boy]] for a match against Liverpool and it was fantastic to meet my heroes [[Michael Owen]] and [[Robbie Fowler]]. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them. Unfortunately I wasn't born when the team had their golden era, but I enjoyed watching the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and [[Steve McManaman]] when I was growing up. When Liverpool won the Champions League last year,&lt;ref&gt;2005&lt;/ref&gt; I went mad. I was shouting so loud I think I woke up the entire village where I live!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/theo-walcott-why-i-m-a-liverpool-fan |date=20 June 2006 |title=Theo Walcott: Why I'm a Liverpool fan |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225104416/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/theo-walcott-why-i-m-a-liverpool-fan |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the start of the [[2005–06 Southampton F.C. season|2005–06]] season, Walcott linked up with the first-team's tour of Scotland, just two weeks after leaving school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5635618.Theo__16__can_break_Danny_s_Saints_record/ |title=Theo, 16, can break Danny's Saints record |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=18 July 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the youngest-ever player with the Southampton first team, at 16 years and 143 days, after coming on as a substitute in Southampton's 0–0 draw at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5636530.Brilliant/ |title=Brilliant |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott made his full first-team debut away to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 18 October 2005, and became Southampton's youngest senior goalscorer after 25 minutes of the 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5638766.Walcott_stars_but_there_s_no_easy_solution_to_Saints__woes/ |title=Walcott stars but there's no easy solution to Saints' woes |newspaper=Daily Echo |location=Southampton |date=19 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again away at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] four days later, and yet again in his full home debut against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the following Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/oct/23/match.sport7 |title=Walcott eclipses Wise |first=Anna |last=Kessel |website=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4366862.stm |title=Southampton 2–0 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rapid rise to fame also led him to be named amongst the top three finalists for the prestigious [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]] award on 11 December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/academy/4499096.stm |title=Three stars up for BBC award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2008–09 Arsenal F.C. season|2008–09 season]], Walcott changed his shirt number from 32 to 14, as previously worn by his idol, [[Thierry Henry]].

====2009–10 season====
[[File:Theo-Walcott Emirates Cup 2010-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Walcott playing for Arsenal in 2010]]
Walcott's [[2009–10 Arsenal F.C. season|2009–10 season]] was marred by injury: he made only 15 starts in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2063032,00.html |title=Walcott axed from England squad |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226185633/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2063032,00.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with lower back, knee and hamstring meant he did not play a full 90 minutes until 9 December, against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in the Champions League, as Arsenal, already qualified for the knockout stages, fielded the youngest team ever to start a match in that competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/11/theo-walcott-arsenal-carlos-vela |title=Theo Walcott claims he is not an injury-prone player, just unlucky |first=David |last=Hytner |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0910/post/first-team/olympiacos-1-0-arsenal-match-report |title=Olympiacos 1–0 Arsenal |first=Richard |last=Clarke |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2010, Walcott scored his second goal of the season against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a 3–1 victory to give Arsenal a decisive lead, with a left-footed effort from the edge of the box, after cutting inside from the right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/08/arsenal-burnley-premier-league |title=Arsenal's Theo Walcott answers critics with display of brainpower |first=David |last=Hytner |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first hour of the Champions League quarter-final first leg, Arsenal were outclassed by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], although only two goals behind. Walcott's appearance off the bench was the turning point. He scored within three minutes of entering the match, "brought speed and fearlessness to the hosts' attacks", and was involved in the move that led to Fàbregas' equaliser from the [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/7541802/Arsenal-2-Barcelona-2-match-report.html |title=Arsenal 2 Barcelona 2: match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much debate,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Wenger reacted to Walcott's performance by starting him in the second leg. According to BBC Sport's match report, Barcelona manager [[Pep Guardiola]] "anticipated his inclusion by bringing in the pacy [[Eric Abidal]]" to mark him, and Walcott's main contribution was to set up [[Nicklas Bendtner]]'s opening goal in a 4–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8602344.stm |title=Barcelona 4–1 Arsenal (agg 6–3) |first=Stuart |last=Roach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
Walcott's start to the [[2010–11 Arsenal F.C. season|2010–11 season]] was particularly successful, winning Arsenal's Player of the Month vote in August by a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/walcott-is-ea-sports-player-of-the-month |title=Walcott is EA SPORTS Player of the Month |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910020103/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/walcott-is-ea-sports-player-of-the-month |archivedate=10 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match of the [[2010–11 Premier League|new Premier League season]], Walcott scored the first [[hat-trick (association football)|hat-trick]] of his club career as Arsenal beat newly promoted [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8925678.stm |title=Arsenal 6–0 Blackpool |first=David |last=Ornstein |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 2010, he scored a goal and made an assist to help beat Chelsea 3–1 in what Arsène Wenger dubbed a "must-win" match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9309539.stm |title=Arsenal 3–1 Chelsea |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6611242,00.html |title=Wenger – We must beat Chelsea |first=Ben |last=Collins |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
On 17 January 2018, Walcott signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Everton in what the BBC reported as "a deal worth more than £20m".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42715223 |title=Theo Walcott: Everton sign forward from Arsenal |first=David |last=Ornstein |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club three days later, providing the assist for [[Oumar Niasse]]'s equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home to West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/20/everton-west-brom-premier-league-report |title=Oumar Niasse's volley earns draw for listless Everton against West Brom |first=Nick |last=Ames |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=20 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then recorded a [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in his next match, a 2–1 win over Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theo Walcott ends Everton's winless run with double against Leicester |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/31/everton-leicester-premier-league-match-report |accessdate=2 February 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===2006 World Cup===
On 8 May 2006, Walcott was surprisingly named in [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads#England|squad]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4983618.stm|title=Walcott &amp; Lennon in England squad|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=15 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having only made 13 appearances in senior football and making none since joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=walcottlennon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-385548/Theo-Walcott-Ten-things-didnt-know.html|title=Theo Walcott: Ten things you didn't know|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=15 August 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with first-choice strikers [[Wayne Rooney]] and Michael Owen both recovering from injury, Walcott was selected over established Premier League strikers [[Darren Bent]] (the highest-scoring English forward in the Premier League in the [[2005–06 Premier League|2005–06 season]]), [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] (the top English goalscorer in the Premier League in the [[2004–05 Premier League|2004–05 season]]), [[Dean Ashton]] (like Bent, already an established player at [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] level) and [[Jermain Defoe]].&lt;ref name=walcottlennon/&gt;

On 25 May 2006, Walcott came on as a second-half substitute for the [[England national football B team|England B]] team against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5017924.stm |title=England B 1–2 Belarus |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2006, he became [[England national football team records|England's youngest ever senior player]] by appearing in a 3–1 [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] win over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Old Trafford]] aged 17 years and 75 days. Despite being one of only two fully fit strikers in the England squad (the other being [[Peter Crouch]]), he did not play during the tournament. Eriksson defended his decision, claiming that the experience would serve Walcott well for future tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2 July 2006| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5139428.stm | title=Eriksson defends Walcott choice |publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=7 July 2006 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the World Cup, Eriksson stepped down as England manager. New appointment [[Steve McClaren]] put Walcott into the England Under-21s, claiming he was "toughening up" on his squad selections.&lt;ref name="Thursday's gossip column"/&gt;

===2007 and 2009 Under-21 European Championships===
On 15 August 2006, Walcott became the youngest player ever to score for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] when he scored the opener after three minutes in England's 2–2 draw with [[Moldova national under-21 football team|Moldova]] at Ipswich Town's ground [[Portman Road]]. The match against Moldova was his first cap for the England under-21s.&lt;ref name="Thursday's gossip column"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/4778613.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=Thursday's gossip column | date=10 August 2006 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott scored two goals against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] to seal qualification for England to the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|Under-21 European Championship]], in the playoff second leg in October 2006, with his second drawing comparisons with Thierry Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,30849-2398754,00.html |date=11 October 2006|title=Wizardry of Walcott puts Germany under a spell |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=8 December 2006 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Lansley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the summer of 2009, Walcott participated in England under-21 team's [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] campaign despite protestations from his club manager, Arsène Wenger. Wenger complained that Walcott's participation in the tournament as well as matches with the senior squad would lead to burn out and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8067214.stm |title=

England reached the final of the U21 Euros, where they lost 4–0 to Germany, with Walcott thus earning a silver medal as a runner-up.&lt;ref name=Euros&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/5690126/England-U21-0-Germany-U21-4-match-report.html |title=England U21 0 Germany U21 4: Match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup Qualification and omission from Finals===
On 6 September 2008, Walcott made his first competitive start in a World Cup qualifier against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1052695/Capello-wields-axe-Becks-Walcott-set-England-start-Andorra.html|title=Capello wields axe on Becks: Walcott set for England start|newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 10 September he opened his senior international goals tally and became the youngest player in history to score a hat-trick for England. In doing so, Walcott also became the first England player to score a hat-trick in a competitive match since Michael Owen in 2001.&lt;ref name=Croatia&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |title=Croatia 1–4 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7602774.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott returned to the international fold on 3 March 2010 in a friendly against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]]. It was his first international start for nine months.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article7049298.ece |title=Theo Walcott does not understand football, says Chris Waddle |author=Smith, Ben |date=4 March 2010 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=30 May 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faded after a bright start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/750456/ce/uk/?campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;cc=4716&amp;ver=global |title=Waddle unimpressed with Walcott |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at [[Wembley Stadium]]. His performance came under heavy criticism from [[Chris Waddle]] who said of Walcott, "I've never seen him develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. It's all off the cuff. I just don't think he's got a football brain and he's going to have problems. Let's be honest, good defenders would catch him offside every time."&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

Walcott started England's friendly victories against Mexico and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8699042.stm|title=England 3–1 Mexico|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8712673.stm|title=Japan 1–2 England|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 1 June 2010, it was announced that Walcott had been left out of England's 23-man World Cup squad by [[Fabio Capello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8713742.stm |title=World Cup 2010: Walcott left out of England squad |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July, a few days after England's exit from the World Cup, [[Lionel Messi]] said that he was shocked by Walcott's exclusion as he believed that Walcott could have made the difference against Germany and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/805925/ce/uk/?cc=4716&amp;ver=global |title=World Cup 2010: Messi shocked by Walcott's axe  |date=4 July 2010 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Capello admitted that he had made a mistake in not selecting Walcott for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-should-have-taken-theo-walcott-to-the-world-cup-admits-fabio-capello-vdppp2t65zc|title=I should have taken Theo Walcott to World Cup, admits Fabio Capello|date=28 January 2011|first=Oliver|last=Kay|newspaper= The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euro 2012===
In the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifying]] match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 7 September 2010, Walcott was stretchered off after he was clipped in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's opener for England after 10 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= England winger Theo Walcott has X-ray on ankle injury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8978359.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting him out of action for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2148973,00.html |title=Walcott blow for Gunners |date=9 September 2010 |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226184512/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2148973,00.html |archivedate=26 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[UEFA Euro 2012]], Walcott appeared for England as a second-half substitute in the group match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Shortly after coming on, Walcott scored to bring the match level at 2–2. Less than 15 minutes later, he provided the cross for [[Danny Welbeck]]'s 74th-minute winner in England's 3–2 victory.&lt;ref name=Sweden&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Sweden 2–3 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18181790 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, England manager Roy Hodgson praised Walcott's "enormous" impact on the match, while [[Lee Dixon]] on the BBC said Walcott had "changed the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2012: Walcott's impact was 'enormous' – Roy Hodgson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18467617|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2012-day eight analysis: How Walcott saved England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18462729|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walcott also played in the final group match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] which England won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Phil | last= McNulty |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18181971|title=England 1–0 Ukraine|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 June 2012|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 World Cup Qualifying===
Walcott started in England's 5–0 win against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]], but was injured in an early clash with the goalkeeper [[Aldo Junior Simoncini|Aldo Simoncini]]. After treatment on the touchline, he was substituted for [[Aaron Lennon]], and then taken to hospital as a precaution, where he underwent "scans and tests" according to England manager [[Roy Hodgson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Kelso|title=England v San Marino: Roy Hodgson fumes as Theo Walcott is cut down by goalkeeper's reckless tackle |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9606149/England-v-San-Marino-Roy-Hodgson-fumes-as-Theo-Walcott-is-cut-down-by-goalkeepers-reckless-tackle.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walcott was later ruled out of England's next match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], he did not start a match in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifiers]] until almost a year later on 6 September, when he played the full 90 minutes in the 4–0 win against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]], he also played 87 minutes in the following match against Ukraine, which ended in a 0–0 draw, but he was injured before England's match against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] and he was still out against Poland, which England won 2–0 to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Euro 2016 omission and World Cup 2018 qualifying===
Having missed out on the 2014 World Cup through injury, Walcott was not selected by Roy Hodgson for the 26-man provisional [[Euro 2016]] squad announced in May 2016. Hodgson commented, "Theo unfortunately has not got such a regular match over the last few months and has had a few problems with injury. It's a tough decision but it's one you have to take."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-marcus-rashford-jack-wilshere-andros-townsend-jordan-henderson|title=Marcus Rashford and Andros Townsend in provisional England Euro 2016 squad|last=Nakrani|first=Sachin|date=16 May 2016|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walcott was informed by England manager [[Gareth Southgate]] on 16 March 2017, his 28th birthday, that he was being dropped from the squad to play a friendly against Germany and a [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], despite scoring 17 goals in 29 appearances in all club competitions during the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref name=dropped&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/16/theo-walcott-dropped-gareth-southgate-england|title=Happy birthday, Theo, you're dropped – England bombshell for Walcott|date=16 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southgate said that Walcott had not transferred his early season form into the England matches against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] and [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in October 2016 and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in November 2016.&lt;ref name=dropped/&gt;
