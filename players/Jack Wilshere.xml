====2010–2013====
[[File:Jack Wilshere Oct 2010 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Wilshere playing for Arsenal in 2010]]

Wilshere started the [[2010-11 Premier League season|2010–11]] season by making his senior [[England national football team|England]] debut in August, becoming the Three Lions' 10th youngest ever player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/all-teams/players/w/jack-wilshere |title=Jack Wilshere |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also featured in all three of Arsenal's Premier League matches, starting in the 1–1 draw against Liverpool, the 6–0 win over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] before coming on as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers, comprehensively displaying fine form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Blackburn 1–2 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8947518.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilshere continued his fine form through to October, however, his month was cut short with a red card in a 2–1 win against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 16 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Sheringham |title=Arsenal 2–1 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9085759.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given his marching orders deep into injury time for a tackle on [[Nikola Žigić]] and missed the rest of the domestic month.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, Wilshere participated in European competition against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] scored the Gunners' fourth goal on the night in a 5–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/9102089.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilshere was again a regular feature alongside [[Alex Song]] at the heart of the Arsenal midfield during the following months.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The role meant he had the responsibility of protecting the Arsenal back four against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=Arsenal3&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9309539.stm |title=Arsenal 3–1 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the likes of [[Michael Essien]] and [[John Obi Mikel]], the 18-year-old was praised for showing great physical strength during the match which Arsenal won 3–1.&lt;ref name=Arsenal3 /&gt; He made seven appearances during the month of January as he continued his partnership with Alex Song at the centre of Arsenal's midfield.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This connection was as such displayed in that of the crunch match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] which was won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9469712.stm |title=Arsenal 1–0 Man Utd |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then England manager [[Fabio Capello]] described him as "the future" and declared his intention to give him the 'holding role' for England after he watched the 19-year-old hold down a midfield place for Arsenal during the course of the season.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Wilshere finished the season competing in all of Arsenal's final fixtures during May, making 49 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilshere a regular in impressive season and is watched by England |url=https://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/jack-wilshere |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer leading into the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Wilshere suffered a stress fracture ankle injury during an Emirates Cup pre-season friendly against [[New York Red Bulls]], and during the first few months of the injury, Arsène Wenger said: "The news we have for Jack is very positive", he had said. "No [he will not be back sooner], we will respect the delays. I count maybe mid-February for Jack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere out for up to five months |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14636507 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilshere news 'very, very good' – Wenger |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/126591.html |publisher=ESPN |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon having successful ankle surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wilshere-has-successful-surgery-on-ankle |title=Wilshere has successful surgery on ankle |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilshere's participation for Arsenal was minimum. Wenger further commented on his injury saying: "The first news we have had is better than expected," said Wenger. "He is not in a boot, but I don't know more. His morale looks quite good and I hope it will only be a short setback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/7464835/positive-news-on-wilshere |title=Positive news on Wilshere |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During further rehabilitation, it looked as if Wilshere would heal, with Wenger saying: "It is difficult to set a deadline on Jack," he said. "We go week by week with him.

Wilshere continued his recovery from his ankle injury, which had ruled him out for the whole of the previous season.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} "We still have to assess them [him and Bacary Sagna] again after the international break," said Arsène Wenger.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} "After that they should not be too far away from normal training."

"He wants to win and shows you that. Of course he will be one of the leaders of this club – in fact he already is. A leader is somebody who does everything on the pitch to help his team to win.

"It is a very small, small, small one. It is to remove a small pin. It will not be a problem. He will need very minor surgery, but we manage that as far as we can until the end of the season. At the moment, we use him only in games when I feel he is really needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/jack-wilshere |title=Wilshere late appearances explained |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
