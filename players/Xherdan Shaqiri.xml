'''Xherdan Shaqiri''' ({{IPA-sq|dʒɛrˈdan ʃaˈciɾi}}; born 10 October 1991) is a Swiss professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss national team]].

He began his career at [[FC Basel]], winning honours including three [[Swiss Super League]] titles, before moving to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], where he gained eight domestic and international honours despite playing less frequently. In January 2015, he moved to [[Inter Milan]] for a fee of €15&amp;nbsp;million, and seven months later to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for a club record £12&amp;nbsp;million. After Stoke's relegation from the Premier League in [[2017–18 Premier League|2018]], Shaqiri was transferred to Liverpool prior to the following season for a reported £13.5&amp;nbsp;million fee.

A full international since 2010, Shaqiri has earned over 70 caps and scored over 20 goals for Switzerland. He represented the nation at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]s, as well as [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/balkan-imports-hitting-big-time-as-switzerland-establish-themselves-as-world-cup-regulars-1.262390|title=Balkan imports hitting big time as Switzerland establish themselves as World Cup regulars|newspaper=The National|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shaqiri was born in [[Gjilan]], SFR Yugoslavia, to [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanian]] parents.&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=321653/profile-detail.html|title=Xherdan SHAQIRI|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballtop.com/players/xherdan-shaqiri|title=Xherdan Shaqiri biography|publisher=FootballTop.com|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Switzerland in 1992 with his parents and three siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/article18891.html|title=Football : Xherdan Shaqiri, le meilleur ambassadeur suisse du Kosovo|newspaper=Le Courrier des Balkans|date=22 December 2012|language=French|accessdate=15 August 2013|first=Simon|last=Rico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720041647/http://balkans.courriers.info/article18891.html|archive-date=20 July 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in [[Augst]], a small town in the canton of [[Canton of Basel-Landschaft|Basel-Country]], near the French and German borders.&lt;ref name=jill&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zimmerli |first1=Jill |title=World Cup 2014: Switzerland profile – Xherdan Shaqiri |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/03/world-cup-2014-switzerland-profile-xherdan-shaqiri |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father did not speak Swiss German, so he had to start out washing dishes in a restaurant, before working construction on roads. His mother worked as a cleaner in office buildings in the city, which he and his brothers helped with. His father would send as much money back to Kosovo to other family members as he could, meaning Xherdan and the family did not have extra spending money, except for birthdays.&lt;ref name="Background"/&gt; He idolized Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who he said played "like magic".&lt;ref name="Background"&gt;{{cite news |title=Xherdan Shaqiri's incredible life story in his own words: from Kosovo to World Cup star|url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/xherdan-shaqiri-stoke-liverpool-transfer-1712944 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Stoke Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===FC Basel===
Shaqiri started his career at hometown club SV Augst, and at the age of eight he was scouted by [[FC Basel]].&lt;ref name=jill/&gt; Whilst playing for Basel's youth team, he competed in the Under-15 Nike Cup 2007 and was named the best player of the tournament. Despite having several other clubs attempting to sign him, he decided to stay with Basel, where he played for their reserve team from 2007 to 2009 in the [[1. Liga Classic|Swiss 1. Liga]]. Two years later, Shaqiri signed his first professional contract with Basel on 2 January 2009,&lt;ref name="fcb 2009-01-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/-/21575/27/7/7|title=Dreijahres-Profivertrag für Xherdan Shaqiri|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=2 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2014|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201180900/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/-/21575/27/7/7|archive-date=1 February 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the new contract keeping him at [[St. Jakob-Park]] until June 2014.

Shaqiri made his Basel club debut as a substitute on 12 July 2009 in Basel's [[2009–10 Swiss Super League|2009–10 season]] opening match against [[FC St. Gallen]] at the [[AFG Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22517/16/7|title=St. Gallen 2 – Basel 0|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141819/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22517/16/7 |archivedate=16 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later he scored his first goal for Basel in a 4–1 win over [[Neuchâtel Xamax]] at home on 9 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/23275/16/7|title=Basel 4 – Xamax 1|publisher=FC Basel 1893|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016141425/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/23275/16/7 |archivedate=16 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[2009–10 Swiss Super League|2009–10]] season Shaqiri won the national [[Double (association football)|Double]] with Basel, and a year later won the League title again.

In December 2011, Shaqiri provided two assists in a match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with Basel winning 2–1.&lt;ref name="Manu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/08122011/58/champions-league-stunned-united-crash-defeat-basel.html|title=Champions League – Stunned United crash out after defeat at Basel|publisher=Yahoo! Europe|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2011–12 season, for the second time in his Basel stint, he won the Double, consisting of the [[2011–12 Swiss Super League|League]] title,&lt;ref name="sfv 1"&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/27863/26/7/7 |title=Jetzt hat Basel den Titel auf sicher|publisher=FC Basel 1893|accessdate=29 April 2012|language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016142727/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/27863/26/7/7 |archivedate=16 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2011–12 Swiss Cup|Swiss Cup]].&lt;ref name="sfv 2"&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|url=http://www.football.ch/sfv/chcup/de/telegramm.aspx?tg=1973921 |title=Matchtelegram FC Basel 1893 5:3 FC Luzern |publisher=Swiss Football Association|accessdate=16 May 2012|language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204154542/http://www.football.ch/sfv/chcup/de/telegramm.aspx?tg=1973921 |archivedate=4 December 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayern Munich===
On 9 February 2012, Basel announced that Shaqiri had accepted a transfer to German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] of the [[Bundesliga]] for the [[2012–13 Bundesliga|2012–13 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/news/story/_/id/1019562/bayern-munich-snap-up-basel-star-shaqiri|title=Bayern snap up Shaqiri|publisher=ESPN|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee was a reported €11.6&amp;nbsp;million, with Shaqiri signing a four-year contract with the German club which would last until 30 June 2016, and which paid him around €2&amp;nbsp;million per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2012/02/15/bayern-shaqiri|title=Bayern's capture of Shaqiri a coup|website=Sports Illustrated|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faced competition for a place in the midfield from established internationals [[Franck Ribéry]], [[Arjen Robben]], [[Toni Kroos]] and [[Thomas Müller]].&lt;ref name=jill/&gt;
[[File:ShaqiriBay.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Shaqiri playing for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 2012.|alt=]]
On 10 July 2012, Shaqiri made his debut in a 1–0 friendly win against [[Bavaria]]n neighbours [[SpVgg Unterhaching]]. His first competitive appearance for the club came on 20 August in a [[2012–13 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] match at [[SSV Jahn Regensburg]], as a half-time substitute. He scored Bayern's second goal as well as providing assists for [[Mario Mandžukić]] and [[Claudio Pizarro]], with Bayern winning 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/match?cc=5901&amp;id=354991|title=SSV Jahn Regensburg 0 – 4 Bayern|publisher=ESPN|date=20 August 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped Bayern secure the top spot in their [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group by scoring a goal and providing assists in a 4–1 defeat of [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] on 5 December, winning the [[Man of the Match]] award and avenging their defeat in [[Minsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000347/match=2009571/postmatch/index.html|title=Bayern power past BATE to finish top of Group F|publisher=UEFA |date=5 December 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012|first=Andy|last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaqiri did not score his first [[2012–13 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] goal until the final league match of the 2012 calendar year, rescuing a point for them in a 1–1 draw with [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], leaving Bayern in first place at the winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2012/0000233823.php|title=Shaqiri rescues point for Bayern|publisher=Bundesliga|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217052140/http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2012/0000233823.php |archivedate=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/346253/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|title=Bayern Munich 1–1 Borussia Monchengladbach|publisher=ESPN FC|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 2013, Shaqiri also scored in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against [[VfL Wolfsburg]] with a long-range shot. Although he did not play in the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final|final]], Shaqiri won the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]] title with Bayern, as well as the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal title, making him one of the Bayern Munich players to have won the first treble in club history; he added the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and [[FIFA Club World Cup]] to his achievements that year.&lt;ref name=jill/&gt; By June 2014, Shaqiri was reported to be the most decorated Swiss footballer of all time at just 22, with 13 medals to his name.&lt;ref name=jill/&gt;
