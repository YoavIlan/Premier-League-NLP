==Club career==
===Liverpool===
Born in [[Liverpool]], Coady grew up supporting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="liverpool supporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheff-utd/sheffield-united-conor-would-be-keen-on-lane-option-1-6591466|title=Conor would be keen on Lane option|publisher=The Sheffield Star|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a product of the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|Liverpool Youth Academy]] after joining the club in 2005. During the [[2010–11 Liverpool F.C. season|2010–11 season]], Coady was on the fringes of the first team, making the subs bench twice but failed to make a first team appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whyatt|first=Chris|title=Sparta Prague 0&amp;nbsp;– 0 Liverpool|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9399199.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkes|first=Phil|title=Liverpool 9&amp;nbsp;– 1 Birmingham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9463392.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coady played every [[Barclays Premier Reserve League|Reserve League]] and [[NextGen Series]] match during the [[2011–12 Liverpool F.C. season|2011–12 season]], scoring five goals.  Despite being named in the senior squad list and being called up to the senior squad occasionally from 2009, he did not make his senior début until 8 November 2012 in a [[UEFA Europa League]] group stage match against [[Anzhi Makhachkala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20164149|title=Anzhi Makhachkala 1–0 Liverpool|date=8 November 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Andre Wisdom]]'s promotion as a full-time senior squad member, Conor Coady was installed as full-time captain of the Under-21 squad and on 12 May 2013 he made his Premier League début in a 3–1 win at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven starlets who stepped up in 2012–13|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/seven-starlets-who-stepped-up-in-2012-13|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152829/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/seven-starlets-who-stepped-up-in-2012-13|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
