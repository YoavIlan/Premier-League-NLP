'''Henrikh Mkhitaryan''' ({{lang-hy|Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան}}, {{IPA-hy|hɛnˈɾiχ məχitʰɑˈɾjɑn||Henrikh-Mkhitaryan.ogg}}; born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and captains the [[Armenia national football team|Armenian national team]].

Mkhitaryan plays mainly as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], but can also be deployed as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|wide midfielder]]. Born in [[Yerevan]], Mkhitaryan began his senior career at local club [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] at age 17, and was instrumental in the side's success in domestic competition, winning four successive [[Armenian Premier League]] titles and an [[Armenian Cup]]. His success caught the attention of Ukrainian side [[Metalurh Donetsk]], where he remained for a singular season before transferring to perennial [[Ukrainian Premier League]] champions and city rivals [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] in 2010, for a fee of €6.1 million.

During his time at Shakhtar, Mkhitaryan became renowned for his goalscoring prowess and footballing intelligence, and gained comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/19/henrikh-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk-jonathan-wilson |work=The Guardian|date= 19 June 2013|accessdate= 19 November 2014|title=Liverpool target Henrikh Mkhitaryan owes much to heritage and hard work | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mkhitaryan would register a goal involvement every 0.75 games at Shakhtar, including a [[Ukrainian Premier League#Champions and top goalscorers|league record goal scoring total]] of 25 in [[2012–13 Ukrainian Premier League|2012–13]], while also being named [[Ukrainian Footballer of the Year#Komanda|Ukrainian Premier League Footballer of the Year]]. After achieving a [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] in three of his four seasons in Shakhtar, his exploits in Ukraine eventually attracted [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia Dortmund]], who signed the player after protracted negotiations for a club-record fee of €27.5 million,&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan disappoints Liverpool by joining Borussia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/09/henrikh-mkhitaryan-joins-borussia-dortmund|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the most expensive Armenian player of all time.

In Germany, Mkhitaryan established himself as one of the best midfielders in Europe, with his creative and goalscoring abilities firing Dortmund to a [[DFL-Supercup]] in [[2014 DFL-Supercup|2014]]. During the [[2015–16 Bundesliga|following campaign]], he registered the most number of [[Assist (football)|assists]] in the Bundesliga, with 15, which ranked him second for the most in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://talksport.com/football/premier-league-201516-top-ten-players-most-assists-160515195918?p=9|title=2015/16: Top ten players with the most assists|publisher=TalkSport|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after again featuring as a runner-up in the Bundesliga, Mkhitaryan relocated to England to join [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a deal worth £30 million (€34.3 million), becoming the first Armenian to play in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/manchester-united-henrikh-mkhitaryan-signs|title=Manchester United complete signing of Henrikh Mkhitaryan on four-year deal|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mkhitaryan's debut season saw him win the [[2016 FA Community Shield|FA Community Shield]], while also scoring the winner as United attained their first [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]] title.&lt;ref name="full_time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.org/newsfiles/uefacup/2017/2019702_fr.pdf |title=Full Time Report Final – Ajax v Manchester United |website=UEFA.org |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |format=PDF |date=24 May 2017 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mkhitaryan stayed a season and a half in Manchester, before lukewarm form and disillusionment with the club's footballing philosophy led him to sign for rivals Arsenal in a deal in 2018.&lt;ref name="arsenal.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bairner|first1=Robin|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan signs as Alexis leaves club|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/henrikh-mkhitaryan-signs-alexis-leaves-club|website=[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s official website|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mkhitaryan has been a member of the senior side in his native country since 2007. He is Armenia's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 26 goals in 80 international matches, as well as registering their first [[hat-trick]]. He has been named [[Armenian Footballer of the Year]] seven times, being awarded the distinction every year since 2009 (with the exception of 2010). He was voted the [[Footballer of the Year in Baltic and Commonwealth of Independent States (Sport-Express)|CIS Footballer of the Year]] for 2012, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from post-Soviet countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan – CIS player of the year|url=http://www.ffa.am/en/-CIS-player-/page/5|publisher=FFA.am|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the award again for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sports.ru/football/158408068.html | script-title=ru:Мхитарян стал лучшим футболистом 2013 года в странах СНГ и Балтии | language = Russian | publisher = sports.ru | date = 5 March 2014 | accessdate = 5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mkhitaryan was born on 21 January 1989 in the Soviet Armenian capital [[Yerevan]] to Marina Taschyan and [[Hamlet Mkhitaryan (born 1962)|Hamlet Mkhitaryan]]. His father was a prominent striker for [[FC Ararat Yerevan]] during the 1980s, who died of a [[brain tumor]] at age 33 when Henrikh was seven years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Հենրիխ Մխիթարյան.

The death of his father impacted Mkhitaryan significantly. He feels that if his father was still alive that "everything would be different." He gave him useful advice from a professional point of view. People who have watched Mkhitaryan and his father, say that their styles resemble each other very much. He has said, "I believe he sees me and is proud of me…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=hy:"Ես հավատում եմ, որ նա ինձ տեսնում է...".

At the beginning of the 1990s, the Mkhitaryan family moved to [[France]], where Hamlet Mkhitaryan played for the now defunct [[ASOA Valence]] and helped them to be promoted to the second division. Mkhitaryan spent his early childhood in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk |work=The Guardian|date= 22 October 2012|accessdate= 1 March 2013|title=Henrik Mkhitaryan orchestrates Shakhtar Donetsk's great leap forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He always wanted to become a football player and began to follow in his father's footsteps. As a child, he would watch his father play and always wanted to follow him to training. The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995. In the same year, Mkhitaryan joined the youth system of [[FC Pyunik]]. He graduated from the [[Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture|Institute of Physical Culture in Armenia]]. He studied [[economics]] at the Yerevan branch of the [[St. Petersburg Institute of International Trade, Economics and Law|St. Petersburg Institute]].

Growing up, Mkhitaryan considered [[Zinedine Zidane]] his football idol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia’s got talent|url=http://shakhtar.com/en/news/24833|publisher=shakhtar.com|accessdate=1 March 2013 | date = 9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also won the [[Armenian Supercup]] twice (2007 and 2009) and the [[Armenian Cup]] once (2009). [[Armenia national football team|Armenian national team]] and Pyunik head coach [[Vardan Minasyan]] admitted that he would love to see his star player "playing in a stronger league." Minasyan stated young Henrikh was well on his way to becoming a legend in his own right. He said of Mkhitaryan, "He can win games on his own. He seizes control at the crucial moment and scores for fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mkhitaryan worthy of a higher calling|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=arm/news/newsid=832354.html|publisher=UEFA.com|accessdate=1 March 2013 | date = 22 May 2009 | first = Khachik | last = Chakhoyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

==Style of play==
Mkhitaryan is an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], who is also capable of playing as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]] or as a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]]. He excels playing in a central role, just behind the [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]], where he often looks to link up with his teammates in and around the penalty area. He is known for his ability to draw away opposing defenders and, in turn, create space for his teammates to exploit, leading to goal scoring opportunities, courtesy of his offensive movement, technique, and vision. Mkhitaryan has also been praised for his precise [[Passing (association football)|passing]], [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability, creativity, ball control and [[work rate]], as well as his eye for the final pass; his skill and trickery on the ball enables him to beat defenders in one on one situations. Furthermore, he possesses an accurate shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEFA Champions League: 4 players to keep an eye out for.|url=http://tikitakastyle.wordpress.com/tag/henrikh-mkhitaryan/|publisher=tikitakastyle.wordpress.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mkhitaryan is one of the best footballers of the Ukraine cup: Buryak|url=http://lurer.com/?p=36069&amp;l=en|publisher=Lurer.com|accessdate=3 March 2013 | date = 14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer [[Pat Nevin]] said of Mkhitaryan, "Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like [[Frank Lampard]]. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAT NEVIN: GROUP TASK|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2915434|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=11 September 2012|first=Pat|last=Nevin|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921161849/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2915434|archivedate=21 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I will not adapt and change anything. I’m going to score goals, then they will definitely remember my name.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krylov |first=Nikita |date=22 August 2013 |title=Генрих Мхитарян: Я не собираюсь менять свое имя |url=http://www.sovsport.ru/news/text-item/635409 |language=Russian |work=Sovetskiy Sport |access-date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan: Respect my name |url=https://sport.news.am/eng/news/28351/henrikh-mkhitaryan-respect-my-name.html |work=NEWS.am Sport |date=22 August 2013 |access-date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revealed in an interview that it was Borussia manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] who gave him that nickname because his surname is too long to pronounce, and he later responded that it is OK to use that nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Samuel|title=Manchester United player Henrikh Mkhitaryan explains his nickname|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-news-henrikh-mkhitaryan-12606327|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Colin|title=Man Utd's Henrikh Mkhitaryan explains nickname given to him by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/588713/Henrikh-Mkhitaryan-Manchester-United-news-nickname|work=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]|date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verified [[Instagram]] account is named ''micki_taryan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=micki_taryan|url=https://www.instagram.com/micki_taryan/|publisher=instagram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Sabre Dance]]" by Armenian composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] was played whenever Mkhitaryan scored. This song became very popular in Donetsk due to Mkhitaryan scoring frequently.&lt;ref name="SBHM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Henrik Mkhitaryan orchestrates Shakhtar Donetsk's great leap forward|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 October 2012 | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, by the decision of the [[Yerevan City Council]], and in connection with the city's 2,794th anniversary, Mkhitaryan was awarded with the "Honorary Citizen of Yerevan" title, for his great success in football and his brilliant achievements in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=hy:Հենրիխ Մխիթարյանը` Երեւանի պատվավոր քաղաքացի|url=http://sport.news.am/arm/news/13023/henrikh-mkhitaryany-erevani-patvavor-qaxaqaci.html|publisher=sport.news.am |accessdate=1 March 2013 | language = Armenian|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mkhitaryan has visited [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] three times on charity visits. In December 2011, Mkhitaryan visited [[Stepanakert]], capital of the disputed territory, and donated gifts to the families of fallen soldiers. He was subsequently awarded the NKR Prime Minister’s medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henrikh Mkhitaryan presented gifts to the families of fallen soldiers|url=http://armenianow.com/sports/soccer/34154/henrik_mkhitaryan_football_charity_karabakh|accessdate=16 August 2013 | date = 15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
