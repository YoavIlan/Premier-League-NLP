'''Thomas David Heaton''' (born 15 April 1986) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for English club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

He began his professional career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] but was unable to break into the first team and spent time on loan with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], before joining Cardiff permanently after his release by Manchester United in July 2010. He then joined [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on a one-year deal with an option of a second year but turned it down in May 2013 in favour of a move to Burnley, whom he has represented in the Premier League, and captained for since 2015.

Formerly an international from under-16 to under-21 level, Heaton has been involved in senior [[England national football team|England]] squads since 2015, finally making his senior debut against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] on 27 May 2016 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] warm-up fixture.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Born in [[Chester]], Cheshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Heaton began his football career with [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], for whom he played both in goal and in midfield, but, after making 20 appearances for the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Under-17 team in the previous two seasons, he signed for United as a trainee on 8 July 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He became a regular in the Under-17 team during the 2002–03 season, and picked up an [[FA Youth Cup]] winner's medal despite playing second fiddle to [[Luke Steele (footballer)|Luke Steele]] throughout the entire competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He made his first appearance in the reserve team the following season, starting in a 3–1 home win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Premier Reserve League on 2 October 2003.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} At the end of the 2003–04 season, Heaton was named on the bench for the final of the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and won a winner's medal despite not taking the field.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By the 2004–05 season, Heaton had become the first-choice goalkeeper for the Manchester United reserve team, and was named on the bench for [[Stan Ternent]]'s testimonial on 17 August 2004, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Luke Steele after Steele had earlier come on for [[Tim Howard]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} With Heaton in goal for 17 of the 28 [[Premier Reserve League]] North matches and 12 of the 22 [[Central League (football)|Central League]] matches, the team went on to win both league titles by nine and five points respectively.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Heaton's form for the reserves resulted in him being loaned out to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] at the start of the [[2005–06 Swindon Town F.C. season|2005–06]], initially until 1 January 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} During his time at Swindon, he played over 20 matches, saving a penalty on his debut, and was described as "one for the future" by manager [[Iffy Onuora]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He returned to Manchester United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2006|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, after the recall of [[Ritchie Jones]] from [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], Heaton was sent there for the rest of the season after United rebuffed an approach from [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Heaton spent the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season|2007–08 season]] with the first team-squad at Manchester United, appearing on the bench when [[Edwin van der Sar]] was out due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2007|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cardiff City (loan)====
At the end of the 2007–08 season, Heaton agreed to move to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the duration of the [[2008–09 Cardiff City F.C. season|2008–09 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff sign Man Utd goalkeeper |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7407805.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2008 |accessdate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen as the club's first choice goalkeeper, above [[Peter Enckelman]], for the start of the season by manager [[Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)|Dave Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Phillips |title=Heaton wins Bluebirds keeper battle for Saints start |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/heaton-wins-bluebirds-keeper-battle-2157149 |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in every match until late November, with the exception of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] third round tie against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], when he was replaced by Enckelman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swansea 1–0 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7626773.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, late on in Cardiff's 2–1 away defeat to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on 22 November 2008, Heaton picked up an injury and was forced off.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The injury would go on to cost Heaton his place in the team as the club went unbeaten with Enckelman in goal for over two months.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In February, Enckelman was forced to undergo knee surgery which saw Heaton return in goal on 16 February 2009, when he picked up the [[man of the match]] award in a 4–0 defeat at the hands of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, he tore his thigh muscle during the match, ruling him out for up to five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff rocked by keeper injury |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7895288.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, Heaton found himself on the bench behind loanee [[Stuart Taylor (footballer, born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] but, following a 6–0 defeat against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], he replaced Taylor for the final three matches of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/player/42250/tom-heaton?season=2008|title=Tom Heaton Player Profile |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to keep Cardiff in the play-off places and he returned to Manchester United at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Terry (16 May 2009).

====Queens Park Rangers (loan)====
On 15 August 2009, Heaton was signed by [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on an emergency three-month loan deal, the terms of which allowed him to compete in the [[2009–10 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive: United keeper pens loan |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10373~1754286,00.html |publisher=Queens Park Rangers F.C. |date=15 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306033024/http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10373~1754286%2C00.html |archivedate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton's loan spell ended on 8 November 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He made one first-team appearance during his loan, in the 1–0 defeat at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the League Cup on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt;

====Rochdale (loan)====
After returning from QPR, Heaton joined [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] on 13 November 2009 until the end of December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heaton makes Dale switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_5692918,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 3–2 loss against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] on 14 November 2009.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; The loan was then extended until 23 January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeping Heaton on |url=http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10441~1917247,00.html |publisher=Rochdale A.F.C. |date=28 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723062351/http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10441~1917247%2C00.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; before a further extension pushed the end date back to 31 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeper extends loan |url=http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10441~1944299,00.html |publisher=Rochdale A.F.C. |date=25 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128102446/http://www.rochdaleafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10441~1944299%2C00.html |archivedate=28 January 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 12 appearances for Rochdale, Heaton conceded only ten goals – including four clean sheets – and finished on the losing team just once.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt;

====Wycombe Wanderers (loan)====
Heaton spent less than two weeks back at Manchester United before going back out on loan to [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 12 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wycombe sign keeper Tom Heaton from Manchester United |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/8512842.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went straight into the Wycombe starting line-up for their away match against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] the following day, which they drew 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brentford 1–1 Wycombe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8494099.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton made his second appearance for the Chairboys in their 0–0 draw against Southampton on Tuesday 23 February 2010.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; He made a great save from a volley to keep the Chairboys on even terms with the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8497013.stm|title = Wycombe 0–0 Southampton|date = 23 February 2010|accessdate = 4 June 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Cardiff City===
[[File:Tom Heaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Heaton playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2011]]

Meeting with Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] on his future at the club amidst an expiring contract, Heaton declined an offer to stay at [[Old Trafford]], deciding instead to leave on free transfer in pursuit of regular playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/tom-heaton-burnley-england-alex-ferguson |title=Burnley's Tom Heaton: 'It got heated for a minute or two with Alex Ferguson' |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Hytner |date=19 August 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release by United, Heaton agreed a deal on 15 June 2010 to return to Cardiff City on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd goalkeeper Tom Heaton returns to Cardiff City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8742377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second debut in 4–1 win over [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] in the League Cup on 11 August.&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt; After first-choice goalkeeper [[David Marshall (footballer)|David Marshall]] suffered an elbow injury, Heaton established himself as Cardiff's new number starter.&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt; In late February, however, he suffered a groin injury, so [[Jason Brown (footballer)|Jason Brown]] and [[Stephen Bywater]] were brought in as cover on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn keeper Jason Brown completes Cardiff loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/9412224.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Heaton went into the team against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], where they won 4–1, their first win in four matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goalkeeper Tom Heaton fitness boost for Cardiff City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/9430040.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton's performances during the 2010–11 season earned him the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Morris |title=Player of the Year awards.

Under new manager, [[Malky Mackay]], Heaton found himself as cover for David Marshall, but he played a key part in the club's [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] run in which they reached the final thanks to two saves from Heaton in a semi-final [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He suffered an ankle injury just before the final, but he overcame the injury to start at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; Heaton followed his penalty heroics against Crystal Palace when he started the penalty shoot-out by pushing [[Steven Gerrard]]'s effort onto the bar, but he ultimately ended up on the losing team as Liverpool won the shoot-out 3–2.&lt;ref name=leaguecup2012&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Cardiff 2–2 Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17093419 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successful cup run, Heaton still found himself second string to Marshall and was released at the end of the season after rejecting a new contract in the Welsh capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Heaton, Lee Naylor and Paul Quinn leave Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18052140 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Heaton held talks with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] over a potential move; however, Watford's new owners decided to pull out of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hornets drop Heaton deal |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7870887/Hornets-drop-Heaton-deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Heaton went on trial with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] during their pre-season training camp in Spain and they opened contract talks soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City in Heaton talks |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7928823/ |publisher=Sky Sports |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, Heaton signed a one-year deal with the club, with the option for a further 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bristol City sign ex-Cardiff City goalkeeper Tom Heaton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19013441 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 18 August 2012, in a 1–0 defeat away to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221320 "Nott'm Forest 1–0 Bristol City"].

Heaton joined Burnley in May 2013, after turning down a further one-year deal at Bristol City.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} His decision was to stay in the Championship, and Burnley offered Heaton a two-year contract attaching him to the club until June 2015, with an option of a third year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22569957 |title=Burnley: Bristol City keeper Tom Heaton to join Clarets |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A target of manager [[Sean Dyche]] while at Watford, Dyche's first Burnley signing was described as a "good technician" with a "great pedigree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/dyche-delight-at-heaton-signing-170513-826442.aspx |title=Dyche delight at Heaton signing |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton immediately became first-choice goalkeeper for Burnley following the departures of [[Lee Grant (footballer, born 1983)|Lee Grant]] and [[Brian Jensen (footballer, born 1975)|Brian Jensen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He made his Burnley debut against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 3 August 2013.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} On 24 August, he was the recipient of a rare technical caution (his second of the match) for handling the ball after releasing it whilst playing against Brighton, a match they lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23736888 |title=Brighton 2–0 Burnley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaton was a part of Burnley's defence that allowed only 37 goals, the fewest in the league, as Burnley returned to the [[Premier League]] for the first time since 2009–10.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Heaton also picked up 19 clean sheets, the most by any keeper in the regular season.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
