'''Kevin Antonio Joel Gislain Mirallas y Castillo''' (born 5 October 1987), more commonly known as '''Kevin Mirallas''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkeβin miˈɾaʎas}}), is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

Mirallas started his professional career in [[Ligue 1|France]] with [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] before moving to [[Superleague Greece|Greece]] with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] in 2010. Mirallas enjoyed success during his time at Olympiacos scoring 34 goals in 52 league games, including being the league's [[Greek Superleague Top Goalscorer|top scorer]] in his second season with 20 goals in 25 games. His impressive performances attracted the attention of Everton who signed him in the summer of 2012 for £6 million.

Mirallas has over 50 caps for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] since his senior debut in 2007. He has represented Belgium at various youth levels and has featured for them at senior level at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]; the latter of which he helped his team reach the quarter-final.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mirallas spent his youth career playing for his hometown club [[Standard Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/08/19/blues-complete-mirallas-swoop | title=Blues Complete Mirallas Swoop | publisher=[[Everton F.C.]] | accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then left Belgium and began his first team career in France by signing for [[Lille OSC]] and played for them since the opening of the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref name="Mirallas"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/kevin-mirallas/2073/ | title=K. Mirallas | publisher=Soccerway | accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas participated in the [[UEFA Cup]] in his first season at the club. Mirallas subsequently was transferred to [[AS Saint-Étienne]] for €4 million, and began to make a name for himself by scoring against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on his debut in the Rhone-Loire derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/22778/o-lyon-vs-as-saint-etienne/preview?ICID=OP|title=O.

===Olympiacos===
In June 2010 Mirallas joined Greek club [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] on a one-year loan for a fee of €2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1249999.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=|title=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) – FIFA|last=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas made his debut in a 5–0 win against [[KS Besa Kavaje]] in the Second Qualifying Round of the [[UEFA Europa League]] Qualifiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/EuropaLeague/mpesa-olympiakos_0-5.411865.html|title=Μπέσα-Ολυμπιακός 0–5 |publisher=Sport24 |date=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 home win against [[Ethnikos Olympiakos Volos F.C.|Olympiakos Volos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/SuperLeague/olympiakos-olympiakos_voloy_3-1.560554.html|title=Ολυμπιακός-Ολυμπιακός Βόλου 3–1 |publisher=Sport24 |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas scored in a 2–1 away loss to their greatest rivals [[Panathinaikos]] in the [[Derby of the eternal enemies]] after which his contract was extended to four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/h_sent_etien_anakoinwse_miralas.766204.html |title= Η Σεντ Ετιέν ανακοίνωσε Μιραλάς! |publisher=Sport24 |date= 1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympiacos won that season's [[Greek Super League]] and Mirallas finished as the club's top scorer with 14 goals, with only Panathinaikos's [[Djibril Cissé]] scoring more league goals than him. The following season Mirallas scored his first ever hat-trick for Olympiacos in a 4–0 away win against [[Levadiakos F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/155/745/3/index.html|title=Mirallas treble sends Olympiacos top |publisher=FIFA |date=14 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored four in a 7–2 victory over [[Asteras Tripolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiacos.org/en/article/9998/olympiacos-fc-asteras-tripolis-7-2|title=OLYMPIACOS F.C. – ASTERAS TRIPOLIS 7–2 |publisher=Olympiacos.org |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympiacos again won the league,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19265336|title=Everton have signed forward Kevin Mirallas on a four-year deal from Olympiakos for a fee of about £6m |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mirallas was the league's top scorer with 20 goals.&lt;ref name="greekts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superleaguegreece.net/statistics/playerstats/16/all/by:SUM_goals/page:1|title=Στατιστικά Παικτών|publisher=Super League Greece|accessdate=19 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805043920/http://www.superleaguegreece.net/statistics/playerstats/16/all/by:SUM_goals/page:1|archivedate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
In August 2012, Mirallas joined [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a reported fee of £6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19265336 | title=Everton sign Kevin Mirallas from Olympiakos for £6m | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut as a second-half substitute during a 3–1 [[Premier League|league]] win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park in which he had a headed goal disallowed due to it being ruled offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19304226 | title=Aston Villa 1–3 Everton | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first start four days later, Mirallas scored twice and provided two assists as Everton won 5–0 against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] in the second round of the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19340512 | title=Everton 5–0 Leyton Orient | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first league goal on 22 September 2012, in a 3–0 away win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] after heading in his initial effort which rebounded off the underside of the bar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19615118 "Swansea 0–3 Everton"] BBC Sport. 22 September 2012. Retrieved 22 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas suffered a number of injuries which limited his number of appearances during the middle part of the season. He made a number of brief cameos, notably against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December. Mirallas' next goal came against [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C|Oldham Athletic]] in a 3–1 win on 26 February 2013 in the fifth round of the [[2012–13 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. He then scored again, scoring his second league goal of the season against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in a 3–1 win on 2 March 2013. He scored his first brace in [[David Moyes]]' last home game in charge of Everton in a 2–0 win against [[West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130512/mirallas-double-downs-hammers_2236884_3176299 |title= Mirallas double downs Hammers |publisher= West Ham United F.C. |date= 12 May 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140522142447/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130512/mirallas-double-downs-hammers_2236884_3176299 |archivedate= 22 May 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kevin Mirallas 2015.jpg|thumbnail|190px|Mirallas warming-up for Everton in 2015]]

Mirallas scored and assisted a goal during a 3–3 draw in the first [[Merseyside derby]] of the [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14 season]] on 23 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24969016 | title=Everton 3–3 Liverpool | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a booking for a high challenge on [[Luis Suárez]] which opposing manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] described as reckless and insisted Mirallas was lucky to remain on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25069608 | title=Everton 3–3 Liverpool: Brendan Rodgers angry with Kevin Mirallas | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score eight goals in the season, before it was ended in April due to a groin injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/kevin-mirallas-everton-injured-rest-of-season | title=Everton's Kevin Mirallas ruled out for rest of season with injury | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirallas created 61 chances for his teammates during the season, the most of any Everton player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.squawka.com/news/squawka-awards-a-statistical-review-of-evertons-season/111807 | title=Squawka Awards: A statistical review of Everton’s Premier League season | publisher=Squawka | accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2014, Mirallas scored his first European goal for Everton, in a 4–1 win over [[VfL Wolfsburg|Wolfsburg]] in the first match of their [[2014-15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29240782 |title=Everton marked their Europa League return with a dominant victory over Germans Wolfsburg at Goodison Park. |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=21 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new three-year contract with the club in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirallas Pens New Deal|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2015/08/07/mirallas-pens-new-deal|publisher=Everton F.C.|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirallas scored his 29th Premier League goals for Everton on 11 March 2017 as Everton cruised to victory over West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everton 3–0 West Bromwich Albion|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39163818|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Neil|last=Johnston|date=11 March 2017|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2017, Mirallas signed a new three-year contract deal with Everton until the end of June 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirallas Signs New Contract|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2017/05/12/mirallas-signs-new-contract|publisher=Everton FC|date=12 May 2017|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Olympiacos====
On 7 January 2018, Mirallas agreed to return to former club Olympiacos on loan until the end of the [[2017–18 Olympiacos F.C. season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everton forward Kevin Mirallas has rejoined Greek club Olympiakos on loan until the end of the season.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42593788|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 January 2018|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club did not have an option to purchase Mirallas as part of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11198607/kevin-mirallas-leaves-everton-for-olympiakos|publisher=Sky Sports|title=Kevin Mirallas leaves Everton for Olympiacos|date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, Mirallas scored a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty area on the stroke of half-time in a 5–1 home win against [[Kerkyra F.C.|Kerkyra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onsports.gr/podosfairo/superleague/story/594339/olympiakos-kerkyra-5-1-pentara-me-tin-ayra-toy-martins |title=Ολυμπιακός – Κέρκυρα 5–1: Πεντάρα με την… αύρα του Μαρτίνς |publisher=www.onsports.gr | language = Greek | date = 16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May, his loan spell was terminated by mutual consent due to Everton's high asking price to purchase Mirallas outright, as well as Mirallas' overall sub-par performances with Olympiacos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/Superleague/olympiacos/parelthon-apo-ton-olympiako-o-miralas.5184702.html|title=Παρελθόν από τον Ολυμπιακό ο Μιραλάς!|work=Contra.gr|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Fiorentina====
On 4 August 2018, Mirallas signed for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] on a season-long loan deal with the option to make the transfer permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirallas Poised For Fiorentina Loan Move|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/08/03/mirallas-makes-fiorentina-loan-move|date=4 August 2018|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirallas joins Fiorentina|url=http://en.violachannel.tv/breaking-detail/items/mirallas-joins-fiorentina.html|date=4 August 2018|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Kevin Mirallas vs DaMarcus Beasley USA vs. Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Mirallas in action against [[DaMarcus Beasley]] during an [[Exhibition match|international friendly]] against the [[United States national men's soccer team|United States]] on 29 May 2013]]
Mirallas has represented Belgium at [[Belgium national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Belgium national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21]] level, and was one of the leading figures in guiding the [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21s]] to the semi-finals of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]].

He scored twice in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] football tournament, once against China (2–0 victory) and once against Italy (3–2 victory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sports Reference|title=Kevin Mirallas Biography and Statistics|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mi/kevin-mirallas-1.html|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his full international debut for the [[Belgium national football team|senior team]] in 2007 and scored his first ever international goal against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in Brussels on 23 August of that year, as a [[Mousa Dembélé (footballer, born 1987)|Mousa Dembélé]] brace helped the Red Devils to a 3–2 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/matches/round=2241/match=83783/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Dembélé double downs Serbia |publisher=UEFA |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirallas was part of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], making his tournament debut in the second group match, a 1–0 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]], as a 75th-minute substitute for [[Dries Mertens]]. In a game of few opportunities, Mirallas hit the post with Belgium's first shot on target, with another substitute [[Divock Origi]] scoring the only goal two minutes from full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chase|first1=Graham|title=Belgium 1–0 Russia|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285242|accessdate=22 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was left out of Belgium’s preliminary [[Belgium national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: Belgium announce initial 28-man squad for Russia| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/belgium-world-cup-squad-confirmed-russia-2018-nainggolan-hazard-de-bruyne-lukaku-a8361241.html%3Famp 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2016}}
Mirallas was deployed as a centre forward for Olympiacos but since his move to Everton he has been deployed mainly as a winger or a free roaming forward. He is known for his pace, close ball control, passing ability and proficiency in one-on-one situations.

==Personal life==
Mirallas' father was born in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/en/learn-english/kevin-mirallas-player-profile|title=Premier Skills English|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521215542/http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/en/learn-english/kevin-mirallas-player-profile|archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
