'''Jerome Terence Sinclair''' (born 20 September 1996) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] for [[EFL League One|League One]] team [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on loan from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He represented England up to [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 level]].

He spent his youth at [[West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], making his senior debut for the latter at the age of 16 years and 6 days in 2012, their youngest player of all time. He went on to make four further appearances for Liverpool after a brief loan spell at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] where he appeared just once. He signed for Watford in July 2016 for a fee of £4&amp;nbsp;million. He spent the second half of the 2016–17 season on loan to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and the first half of the following season on loan at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] before his loan to Oxford for the second half of the season.

==Early life==
Sinclair was born in [[Dudley Road Hospital]], [[Birmingham]], and raised in the [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/birmingham-citys-jerome-sinclair-couldnt-12535802 |title=Birmingham City's Jerome Sinclair: This is why I couldn't turn Gianfranco Zola down |first=Aidan |last=McCartney |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing organised football as a seven-year-old with Phoenix United, part of a scheme designed to use sport to keep youngsters off the streets and promote positive values. He was spotted while playing for Phoenix United, invited to a trial with [[West Bromwich Albion]], and joined that club as a schoolboy at the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/articles/2006/11/15/bc_cin_phoenix_united_feature.shtml |title=Phoenix United – giving talented kids a goal |publisher=BBC Black Country |date=9 September 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he supported [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and idolised [[Thierry Henry]].&lt;ref name=NexLions&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/127203-meet-our-nexlions-stars-part-two |title=Meet our NexLions stars: Part two |first=Steve |last=Hunter |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sinclair joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s youth academy, his father moved to Liverpool with him, while his mother, sister and four brothers remained at home in Birmingham.&lt;ref name=GaryLim&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/sports/football-jerome-sinclair-could-be-reds-next-star?nopaging=1 |title=Football: Jerome Sinclair could be the Reds' next star |first=Gary |last=Lim |newspaper=The New Paper |location=Singapore |date=2 October 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While with West Brom, he had attended [[Sandwell Academy]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sandwellacademy.com/Uploads/documents/magazine/issue01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sports round-up |first=Ashley |last=Bailey |magazine=The Student Voice |publisher=Sandwell Academy |page=23 |date=Spring 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esfa.co.uk/competitions/?2010/Boys/u14b_sc/6 |title=2010–2011 competitions: ESFA Under 14 Premier League Schools' Cup: Round 6 |publisher=English Schools' Football Association |accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as customary with Liverpool's academy recruits, he continued his education at [[Rainhill High School]] in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/homework-important-footwork-brendan-rodgers-6275372 |title=Videos: Homework is as important as footwork, Brendan Rodgers tells the next generation of Liverpool FC stars |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got good grades in his [[GCSE]]s,&lt;ref name=GaryLim/&gt; and went on to study for an [[A level]] in business studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/football/Premiership/article1500239.ece |title=Soup kitchens to superstars |first=Jonathan |last=Northcroft |newspaper=Sunday Times |location=London |date=28 December 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
====Academy====
Liverpool signed Sinclair as a 14-year-old from the [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] youth academy in the summer of 2011&lt;!-- after refusing to extend his his scholarship terms with West Bromwich following interest from the Merseyside team *** not in cited source ***--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9567196/Liverpool-teenager-Jerome-Sinclair-set-to-become-clubs-youngest-ever-player-aged-16-years-and-six-days.html |title=Liverpool teenager Jerome Sinclair set to become club's youngest ever player aged 16 years and six days |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liverpool staff compared him to [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A258058424/GPS?sid=wikipedia |title=Ciss is one for Kenny |newspaper=The People |location=London |date=5 June 2011 |page=54 |accessdate=2 February 2017 |via=Infotrac Newsstand |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of the 2011–12 season with the Under-16s before coach [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] gave him a run of four games with the Under-18s at the end of the season. He impressed greatly in those games, though he failed to find the back of the net. On 14 July 2012, Sinclair came off the bench to score a hat trick against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in an Under-18s pre-season friendly. In all, Sinclair netted eight goals in the six Under-18s pre-season friendly games in the run up to the 2012–13 Academy Under 18s season. He went on to score his first competitive goals for the Under-18s on 25 August 2012, hitting a brace in a 3–3 draw with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====Reserves and first-team debut====
While still only 15, Sinclair was called up to Rodolfo Borrell's [[NextGen Series (2011–13)|NextGen Series]] side for the away match with defending champions [[Inter Milan]] in September 2012, after first-team manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] included a number of young players in his [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] squad. He started the match and performed well, winning a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that [[Krisztián Adorján]] converted and going close himself on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/liverpool-inter-milan-nextgen-jerome-sinclair-krisztian-386290 |title=Liverpool youngsters edged out by NextGen champions Inter Milan |first=Adrian |last=Back |newspaper=International Business Times |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers called Sinclair up to the first team for the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] third-round tie away to his boyhood club, West Bromwich Albion, on 26 September. At the age of 16 years and 6 days, he came off the bench in the 81st minute to replace [[Samed Yeşil]] in the 2–1 win at [[The Hawthorns]], thus breaking [[Jack Robinson (footballer born 1993)|Jack Robinson]]'s record as Liverpool's youngest ever player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645199 |title=West Brom 1–2 Liverpool |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the [[2012–13 Liverpool F.C. season|2012–13 season]] Sinclair continued to play for Liverpool U18s, but his 2013–14 season was disrupted by injury.&lt;ref name=ChelseaU21&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-u21s-2-0-chelsea-8756434 |title=Liverpool FC U21s 2–0 Chelsea U21s: Jerome Sinclair could be next Academy graduate heading to first team and Sergi Canos' form going from strength to strength – five things we learned |first=Andy |last=Kelly |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the beginning of March 2015, Sinclair scored 22 goals for Liverpool youth teams at various levels,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} including 6 goals in 7 [[2014–15 UEFA Youth League|UEFA Youth League]] games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/clubs/club=2606417/index.html |title=UEFA Youth League: Liverpool FC |publisher=UEFA |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an impressive finish against [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United U21]], beating [[Víctor Valdés]] at his near post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/9682179/manchester-united-u21s-beat-liverpool-2-1-as-victor-valdes-makes-first-appearance-for-the-club |title=Manchester United U21s beat Liverpool 2-1 as Victor Valdes makes first appearance for the club |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a solo effort against Chelsea U21.&lt;ref name=ChelseaU21/&gt; He was one of several youngsters to travel to a [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] tie against [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] in February, but was not included in the matchday squad as Liverpool were eliminated [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|on penalties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9731634/europa-league-jordan-henderson-and-philippe-coutinho-absent-for-liverpool-tie-at-besiktas |title=Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho absent for Liverpool at Besiktas |publisher=Sky Sports |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31627521 |title=Besiktas 1–0 Liverpool |first=Mike |last=Whalley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2015, Sinclair was loaned to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], where he linked up with academy teammate [[Sheyi Ojo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/181788-sinclair-joins-wigan-on-youth-loan-deal |title=Sinclair joins Wigan on youth loan deal |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he made his [[Football League]] debut in what proved to be his only Wigan appearance, replacing [[Marc-Antoine Fortuné]] for the final eight minutes of a 2–0 loss to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at the [[DW Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31809691 |title=Wigan 0–2 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Liverpool, Sinclair made his [[Premier League]] debut as a 68th-minute substitute for [[Rickie Lambert]] in a 1–1 draw away to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 10 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32571658 |title=Chelsea 1–1 Liverpool |first=Marc |last=Higginson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first appearance of the 2015–16 season, away to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 8 January 2016, Sinclair scored his first senior goal for Liverpool in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35155398 |title=Exeter City 2–2 Liverpool |first=Gary |last=Rose |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later he confirmed that he would leave Liverpool at the end of the season, suggesting he wanted to play in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35342040 |title=Jerome Sinclair: Liverpool youngster to leave the club |first=Simon |last=Stone |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, an offer from [[AFC Bournemouth]] of £4&amp;nbsp;million plus add-ons was accepted by the club but rejected by the player.&lt;ref name=AFCBbid&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-hope-jerome-sinclair-tribunal-11372756 |title=Liverpool hope for Sinclair tribunal windfall |first=Neil |last=Jones |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
In the January 2016 transfer window, Liverpool had rejected an offer of £1.5&amp;nbsp;million for Sinclair from Premier League club Watford. On 21 May, Sinclair agreed to join that club when his current contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-striker-jerome-sinclair-join-11366148 |title=Liverpool striker Jerome Sinclair to join Watford on four-year contract |first=Neil |last=Jones |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Sinclair was aged under 24, Liverpool were due a developmental fee; the clubs settled on £4&amp;nbsp;million, and Sinclair signed a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36670308 |title=Jerome Sinclair: Watford sign out-of-contract Liverpool striker |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not make his debut until 3 December, as a 94th-minute substitute in a defeat by West Bromwich Albion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38113785 |title=West Bromwich Albion 3–1 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his first start a few days later against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], a match in which City won at home for the first time since mid-September and [[BBC Sport]]'s reporter described Sinclair as "a peripheral figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38232213 |title=Manchester City 2–0 Watford |first=Jonathan |last=Jurejko |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An approach in late December by Championship club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] to take him on loan was rebuffed because manager [[Walter Mazzarri]] felt he was needed as cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://talksport.com/football/former-liverpool-striker-jerome-sinclair-told-fight-his-place-watford-161228221861 |title=Former Liverpool striker Jerome Sinclair told to fight for his place at Watford |publisher=TalkSport |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sinclair scored his first goal for Watford in their FA Cup third-round tie against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] on 7 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38474747 |title=Watford 2–0 Burton Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 January 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the transfer window, Mazzarri stated that Sinclair needed to gain experience and was free to go out on loan if he so wished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/watford-boss-admits-nottingham-forest-birmingham-city-target-jerome-sinclair-can-leave-on-loan/story-30096863-detail/story.html |title=Watford boss admits Nottingham Forest &amp; Birmingham City target Jerome Sinclair can leave on loan |first=Matt |last=Storey |newspaper=Hertfordshire Mercury |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birmingham City (loan)====
On 31 January 2017, Sinclair moved to Championship club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38798273 |title=Birmingham sign Arsenal's Krystian Bielik and Watford's Jerome Sinclair on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went straight into the starting eleven for the next match, at home to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], partnering [[Lukas Jutkiewicz]], and was replaced after 67 minutes with the score still goalless; Birmingham won the match 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/birmingham-city-1-fulham-0-12556615 |title=Birmingham City 1 Fulham 0 – report, stats and video as Gianfranco Zola picks up first win in charge |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=4 February 2017 |accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared regularly during February, but the last of his five appearances came as a very late substitute in a home defeat against [[Leeds United]] on 3 March.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt;

Having played just 27 minutes of Premier League football for his parent club in the 2017–18 season,&lt;ref name=Soccerway&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.soccerway.com/players/jerome-sinclair/269271/ |title=J.
