Graham has represented both [[England national football team|England]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] at youth level. He is a product of the [[Aston Villa Under-21s and Academy|Aston Villa Academy]], having spent twelve years there as a junior.

==Career==
Graham is a product of the Aston Villa youth academy and was a member of their [[NextGen Series]] winning side in the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref name=nextgen/&gt; He signed a professional contract with Villa in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2634177,00.html| title=Academy starlet Graham signs professional contract| publisher=Aston Villa F.C|date= 7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, he joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on loan, where he made his professional debut on 7 December 2013 in a 2–1 win over [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25163687 | title = Ipswich 2–1 Huddersfield | publisher = BBC Sport| date = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also made an appearance in the victory over [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] before he returned to Villa at the end of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/ipswich-town-news/24305? | title= Loanee Returns to Villa | publisher=Ipswich Town F.C | date = 31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2014, he joined League One side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on a one-month loan deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Graham comes to city |url=http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/graham-joins-city-1285252.aspx |publisher=Bradford City AFC |date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom he made one appearance: against his future club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 1 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25891950| title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–0 Bradford City| publisher=BBC Sport| date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winger joined Wolverhampton Wanderers, now returned to the Championship, in November 2014 on loan until the January transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30238820| title =Aston Villa: Wolves sign midfielder Jordan Graham on loan| publisher = BBC Sport| date =27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injury prevented him from making any appearances during this loan period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/jordan-graham-completes-move-2182698.aspx| title=Jordan Graham completes move| publisher = Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C | date = 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he signed a permanent 18-month deal with the club on 5 January 2015 for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30682931| title=Jordan Graham completes move| publisher =BBC Sport| date = 5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to make a first-team appearance for Wolves, he was sent on a month-long loan to League Two side [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Oxford United: Winger Jordan Graham set to join on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34381097|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a successful initial month, his loan was extended by two months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34621656 |title=Jordan Graham: Winger extends Oxford loan by two months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a few days later he was recalled by Wolves after an injury crisis at his parent club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oufc.co.uk/news/article/oxford-united-wolves-jordan-graham-2767506.aspx |title=Winger Graham Returns To Wolves |publisher=Oxford United F.C. |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham scored his first goal in his club career for Wolverhampton Wanderers on 28 December 2015 in the 52nd minute of a Championship game against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at The Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35147801 |title=Charlton Athletic 0 Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered torn knee ligaments during a game against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 16 January 2016. Despite this, Graham extended his contract with Wolves until the end of the 2017–18 season, with the club having the option of two additional years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35533293| publisher=BBC Sport| title=Wolves: Jordan Graham and Kortney Hause extend contracts|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial prognosis of his injury was that he was expected to be missing from action for between nine and 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35343431 |title=Jordan Graham: Wolves winger out for nine months with injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after suffering several setbacks during his recovery, he did not return to first-team football until 15 months later, on 25 April 2017, in a 1–0 defeat against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield]] at Molineux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39035260| publisher=BBC Sport| title=Wolverhampton Wanderers 0–1 Huddersfield Town|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2017, he joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20170831-graham-loaned-to-fulham/|title=Graham Loaned To Fulham
|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January 2018, after making just three league appearances, Graham returned to Wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2018/january/15/jordan-graham-returns-to-wolves|title=Graham Returns To Wolves|publisher=Fulham F.C.|date=15 January 2018|accessdate= 27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
