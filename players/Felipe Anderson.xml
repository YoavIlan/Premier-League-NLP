==Early and personal life==
Felipe Anderson was the youngest of five children in a poor family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47240426|title=Felipe Anderson: West Ham midfielder on family, humble origins and his friend Neymar|date=21 February 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Felipe Anderson began his career in Associação 14 Companhia de Polícia Militar Independente (CPMIND), in his hometown of [[Santa Maria, Federal District|Santa Maria]], [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]] at 6 years old. In 2006, he was moved to Federal FC, and later to Sport Clube Recreativo Gaminha FC. After some impressive performances on the club, he was moved to [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] to play for Astral EC, finishing the year. In 2007, he was moved to [[Coritiba FC|Coritiba]] youth side, and then in 2007 summer he was moved to [[Santos FC|Santos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felipeanderson.com.br/ Felipe Anderson's official website]; FelipeAnderson.com.br {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santos===
Felipe Anderson then played for Santos' youth categories, and was promoted to the senior squad following a rash of injuries in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Yahoo! Brasil Notícias|title=Felipe Anderson sobre o clássico: Estava doido para entrar|url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/s/03102010/85/esportes-felipe-anderson-classico-doido-entrar.html|language=Portuguese|date=3 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709143657/http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/s/03102010/85/esportes-felipe-anderson-classico-doido-entrar.html|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began training with the senior side and signed a professional contract until July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Globo Esporte|title='Tenho o estilo do Ganso', diz Felipe Anderson, nova promessa da Vila|author=Tiago Leme|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/santos/noticia/2010/10/tenho-o-estilo-do-ganso-diz-felipe-anderson-nova-promessa-da-vila.html|language=Portuguese|date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for [[Santos FC|Santos]] on 6 October 2010 as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–0 win against [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2010/2010-10-06/fluminense-santos.html Nem Fred nem Neymar: Zé Love brilha, faz três, e Santos bate o Flu (Neither Fred nor Neymar: Zé Love shines, scores three and Santos beats Flu)]; Globoesporte.com, 6 October 2010 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first goal of his footballing career came on 11 February 2011, when Felipe came off the bench at half time to replace [[Keirrison]] against [[Esporte Clube Noroeste|Noroeste]], scoring from a long range shot in the 70th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2011/02/12/brazil/paulista-a1/santos-futebol-clube-sao-paulo/esporte-clube-noroeste/1046381/|title=Santos 2–0 Noroeste|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, he scored his first league goal, against [[Avaí Futebol Clube|Avaí]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/brasileirao2011/07-09-2011/avai-santos.html FELIPE ANDERSON SAI DO BANCO E AJUDA O SANTOS A VIRAR JOGO SOBRE O AVAÍ (FELIPE ANDERSON LEAVES THE BENCH AND HELP SANTOS TO COMEBACK OVER AVAÍ)]; Globoesporte.com, 7 November 2011 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, he signed a new contract with Santos, running until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://placar.abril.com.br/brasileiro/santos/felipe-anderson/noticias/novo-menino-da-vila-felipe-anderson-chega-a-acordo-e-renova-com-o-santos.html Novo “Menino da Vila”, Felipe Anderson chega a acordo e renova com o Santos (New "Menino da Vila", Felipe Anderson reaches an agreement and renews with Santos)]; Placar, 5 November 2011 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his following season, Felipe Anderson had more chances in first team alongside [[Neymar]], due to [[Paulo Henrique Ganso|Ganso]]'s injuries and [[Elano]]'s poor form (both players left Santos in the middle of the season). On 9 February 2012, he scored his first goal of the season, against [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo-SP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancenet.com.br/santos/Neymar-Santos-vence-Botafogo_0_643135909.html Neymar faz três e comanda a goleada do Santos sobre Botafogo-SP (Neymar scores thrice and lead Santos'thrashing victory over Botafogo-SP)]; Lance!Net, 9 February 2012 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 31 January 2013, the agreed transfer to the Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for €7.5 million failed due to late arrival of a necessary international fax from Brazil to close the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/01/felipe-anderson-andrea-poli-deals-fall-through/ Felipe Anderson &amp; Andrea Poli Deals Fall Through]; forzaitalianfootball.com, 31 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lazio===
On 25 June 2013, Lazio agreed a [[Euro|€]]7.8 million fee with Santos,&lt;ref&gt;[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/santos/noticia/2013/06/santos-acerta-transferencia-de-felipe-anderson-para-lazio-por-r-xx.html Santos acerta transferência de Felipe Anderson para o Lazio por € 7,8 mi (Santos closes transfer of Felipe Anderson to Lazio for € 7.8m)]; Globo Esporte, 25 June 2013 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Felipe Anderson signed a five-year deal worth €800,000 a year. Santos received 50% of the transfer sum and the third part owner [[Doyen Sports]] would get the rest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/06/agreement-finally-reached-for-felipe-anderson/ Lazio Reach Deal For Felipe Anderson]; Forza Italia Football, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lazio's sporting director Igli Tare criticized the third part owner Doyen Sports for numerous times delaying the transfer, “It will remain in history as the most paradoxical and shocking negotiations I have ever been a part of,” said Tare. “These third party owners changed their minds continually. When we had everything decided, they would start from scratch two hours later. It all happened for a full week, so it felt like being in the Twilight Zone."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====2014–15 season====
In his [[2014–15 S.S. Lazio season|second season at the club]], Felipe Anderson achieved 10 goals and nine assists in 27 games across all competitions by April 2015.&lt;ref name=samba&gt;{{cite news|last1=Persico|first1=Luca|title=Brazil Head Coach Dunga doesn't want Lazio's Felipe Anderson compared to Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/71053_brazil_head_coach_dunga_doesn_t_want_lazio_s_felipe_anderson_compared_to_cristiano_ronaldo_and_neymar.html|accessdate=29 May 2015|work=Sambafoot|date=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the concluding goal as Lazio defeated [[A.S.

====2015–16 season====
In July, it was announced that Felipe Anderson would not be wearing the number 7 shirt that he had worn in his previous season with Lazio, but that he would instead be awarded the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciomercato.com/news/lazio-felipe-anderson-saluta-la-maglia-numero-7-496977|title=Lazio: Felipe Anderson saluta la maglia numero 7|publisher=CalcioMercato.com|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August, Felipe Anderson appeared in Lazio's 2–0 defeat to Juventus in the [[2015 Supercoppa Italiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2015/08/08/news/supercoppa_lazio_juventus-120631891/|title=Juventus-Lazio 2–0, Mandzukic e Dybala decidono la Supercoppa|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2015, Felipe Anderson scored his first goal of [[2015–16 Serie A|the season]] in a 2–0 victory against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio vs. Genoa 2–0|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2015/09/23/italy/serie-a/ss-lazio-roma/genoa-cfc/2120422/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring the second goal in a 3–1 [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] win against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] on 22 October 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio vs. Rosenborg 3–1|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2015/10/22/europe/uefa-cup/ss-lazio-roma/rosenborg-ballklubb/2147216/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felipe Anderson scored twice in a 3–0 win against [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio vs. Torino 3–0|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2015/10/25/italy/serie-a/ss-lazio-roma/torino-fc/2120461/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Lazio publicly denied rumours that [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] had agreed a transfer for Felipe Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/22/lazio-deny-felipe-anderson-manchester-united|title=Lazio deny Felipe Anderson has agreed to join Manchester United in summer|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felipe Anderson finished [[2015–16 S.S. Lazio season|Lazio's season]] with nine goals in all competitions, coming runner-up to [[Antonio Candreva]] in Lazio's scoring charts for the season.

====2016–17 season====
After being the subject of reported interest from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] during the summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/2911040/antonio-conte-chelsea-emerge-as-favourites-for-lazio-felipe-anderson|title=Chelsea first for Felipe Anderson, Prem clubs eye William Carvalho|publisher=ESPN|date=11 June 2016|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felipe Anderson remained with Lazio.

====2017–18 season====
During the [[2017–18 S.S. Lazio season|2017–18]] season Felipe Anderson's form suffered numerous setbacks. A falling out with manager [[Simone Inzaghi]] after a 2–1 defeat to Genoa in February 2018 coupled with a knee injury that kept him out from August to December 2017 restricted Felipe Anderson to just nine [[Serie A]] starts for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Felipe Anderson back on form at Lazio, but how long will it last?|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/italian-serie-a/12/blog/post/3400524/felipe-anderson-back-on-form-at-lazio-but-how-long-will-it-last|publisher=ESPN|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Felipe Anderson injury concerns|url=https://www.football-italia.net/108811/felipe-anderson-injury-concerns|publisher=Football Italia|date=26 August 2018|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2018, Felipe Anderson scored in his final game for Lazio in a 3–2 defeat to [[Inter Milan]] in a game that saw the victors qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] over Lazio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio vs. Internazionale 2–3|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2018/05/20/italy/serie-a/ss-lazio-roma/fc-internazionale-milano/2539153/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
On 15 July 2018, Felipe Anderson signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a reported transfer fee of £36&amp;nbsp;million. The fee surpassed the previous record paid by the club, set with the £22&amp;nbsp;million signing of [[Issa Diop (footballer)|Issa Diop]] earlier in the [[List of English football transfers summer 2018|same transfer window]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Felipe Anderson: West Ham sign Lazio midfielder for club record fee|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44810938|first=Simon|last=Stone|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A quick, well-rounded, and technically gifted [[midfielder]], with a slender and diminutive but long-limbed physique, Felipe Anderson is considered a promising and talented young player. He is predominantly known for his pace, and is regarded as one of the fastest players in the modern game; although not imposing physically or in the air, he also possesses good ball control, quick feet, and excellent [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, which allow him to beat opponents in one on one situations. A tactically versatile player, he is capable of playing in several different positions due to his wide range of skills, high work-rate, and ability to both create and score goals: he has been used as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] or as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfield]] [[playmaker]], but has most frequently been deployed as either a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], due to his offensive movement and tendency to operate between the lines; he is capable of playing on either flank or through the centre of the pitch, due to his ability to cut into the middle and strike on goal, or move out to the wing to provide accurate [[Cross (football)|crosses]] to teammates in the area. In addition to his speed, stamina, creativity and technical ability, he is known for his eye for goal, and is gifted with a powerful and accurate shot from distance with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed; he is also an accurate [[Direct free kick|set-piece]] and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] taker. He can also serve as an [[Assist (football)|assist]]-man due to his creative ability, vision, dead-ball delivery, and eye for the final pass.&lt;ref name="da Anderson a Yakovenko"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Magic_Cup/05-09-2013/magic-campionato-serie-a-tutti-nuovi-stranieri-serie-a-anderson-yakovenko-201102296407.shtml|title=Tutti i nuovi stranieri della serie A: da Anderson a Yakovenko|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Massimo Tanzillo|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ita/news/newsid=2227457.html|title=UEFA.com's weekly wonderkid: Felipe Anderson|publisher=UEFA|author1=Paolo Menicucci|date=28 March 2015|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcioweb.eu/2013/07/i-nuovi-stranieri-della-serie-a-felipe-anderson/64556/|title=I nuovi stranieri della Serie A: Felipe Anderson|publisher=CalcioWeb.eu|language=Italian|author1=Vincenzo Currò|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondosportivo.it/2013/08/20/fantacalcio-alla-scoperta-di-felipe-anderson/|title=Fantacalcio: alla scoperta di Felipe Anderson|publisher=mondosportivo.it|language=Italian|author1=Demetrio Bertuletti|date=20 August 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/scouting-and-prospects/78/post/2233109/scouts-notebook-felipe-anderson|title=Scout's Notebook: Lazio's speedster Felipe Anderson has lit up Serie A|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Nick Dorrington|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.ilmessaggero.it/sslazio/lazio_felipe_anderson_profilo/295304.shtml|title=Lazio, ecco chi è Felipe Anderson Il nuovo jolly biancoceleste|publisher=Il Messaggero|author1=Daniele Magliocchetti|language=Italian|date=22 June 2013|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/meet-neymars-former-partner-crime-whos-setting-serie-alight|title=Meet Neymar’s former partner in crime who's setting Serie A alight|publisher=FourFourTwo|author1=Alasdair Mackenzie|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/23/lazio-felipe-anderson-serie-a|title=Lazio’s Felipe Anderson lights up surreal Sunday with his ‘dance rock’ style|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Paolo Bandini|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/lazio/2016/11/11/news/anderson_dubbi_malumori_hoedt_cataldi-151818772/|title=Lazio, i dubbi di Anderson: "Qui per sempre?
