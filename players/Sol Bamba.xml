'''Souleymane Bamba''' (born 13 January 1985) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast national team]] as a [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]].

Bamba started his career in his native France with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], but failed to establish himself in their first team. He moved to Scotland to join [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in 2006, helping the club reach the final of the [[Scottish Cup]] in his first season. Two years later, he was transferred to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], before joining English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in January 2011. 

He was sold to Turkish club [[Trabzonspor]] in 2012 for £750,000 before joining [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]. However, he was loaned to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after making only one appearance in six months. He eventually joined Leeds on a permanent deal and was appointed club captain, spending a further year with the club before being released and subsequently joining Cardiff City. In his first full season with Cardiff, he helped the side win promotion to the Premier League.

Born in France to Ivorian parents, Bamba represented Ivory Coast in the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympic Games]] and became a regular for the senior national side until his most recent cap in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/hibernian/2009/11/10/hibs-ace-sol-bamba-given-green-light-to-join-ivory-coast-s-world-cup-bid-86908-21810518/ |title=Hibs ace Sol Bamba given green light to join Ivory Coast's World Cup bid |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Marshall |first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was part of the side that reached the final of the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]].

==Club career==

===Paris Saint-Germain===

Bamba began his career with [[Ligue 1]] club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) at the age of 11. He had been spotted by club scouts playing street football in Paris but had initially turned the club down as his mother hoped for him to become a doctor.&lt;ref name="qa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-sol-bamba-podcast-14468355 |title=The big Sol Bamba Q &amp; A: Cardiff City star joins Blakey's Bootroom to talk promotion, Neil Warnock and all things Bluebirds |publisher=WalesOnline |last=Booth |first=Dominic |date=28 March 2018 |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his parents Sehrata and Bakary Bamba in [[Ivry-sur-Seine]],&lt;ref name="dreams"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227489219.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050047/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227489219.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Hibs' Bamba's World Cup of dreams. |newspaper=Evening News |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a suburb in central Paris. Since his family could not afford the travel to the club's training facilities outside the city, he moved away from his family home to instead live at the club's academy.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theleaguepaper.com/featured/2117/big-interview-with-leeds-uniteds-sol-bamba-adam-pearson-has-been-very-important/ |title=Big Interview with Leeds United’s Sol Bamba: “Adam Pearson has been very important” |newspaper=The Football League Paper |last=Ellis |first=Adam |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally playing as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], he converted to playing as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]] at the age of 15 after impressing there as cover for a teammate who had missed a match due to being stuck in traffic.&lt;ref name="regret"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/851229/EFL-question-and-answer-Sol-Bamba-Cardiff-City-Neil-Warnock |title=EFL Q&amp;A: Sol Bamba on his Leicester regret, Neil Warnock's music taste and proper tackling |newspaper=Sunday Express |last=Speck |first=Ivan |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite impressing for PSG's youth and B teams, he only appeared in two first team games, in his final year at the club at the age of 21.&lt;ref name = "career interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/hibs-provide-world-cup-springboard-as-bamba-comes-on-leaps-and-bounds-1-768541 |title=Hibs provide World Cup springboard as Bamba comes on leaps and bounds |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Bathgate |first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with his lack of appearances, Bamba asked to be sent out on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to gain experience but was denied by manager, [[Vahid Halilhodžić]], causing Bamba to reject PSG's offer of a new contract and subsequently leave the club.&lt;ref name = "career interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/leeds-sol-bamba-discusses-training-with-ronaldinho-and-life-at-psg/450192#QCuOuYP5b4xcMAkU.97 |title=Leeds’ Sol Bamba discusses training with Ronaldinho and life at PSG |website=squawka.com |last=Hamouda |first=Omar |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that PSG had damaged potential transfers to other French sides after he left the club, stating "I was disappointed because my club said, 'He's a good player but he's a tough guy – he doesn't listen and he can get the team into trouble."&lt;ref name="career interview"/&gt;

===Dunfermline Athletic===
After an initial trial period, Bamba signed for [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in July 2006 on a two-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/5219198.stm|title=Defender Bamba joins Dunfermline|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 July 2008 | date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Leishman]] later revealed that he had been intending to bring over another player from France on trial, but this deal fell through and Bamba's agent sent him instead.&lt;ref name = "leishman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/leishman-believes-bamba-can-use-world-cup-finals-as-a-springboard-1-807389 |title=Leishman believes Bamba can use World Cup finals as a springboard |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2010 |last=Collin |first=Iain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leishman was immediately impressed by Bamba's physique and his performance as a trialist during a preseason friendly against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] striker [[John Hartson]].&lt;ref name = "leishman"/&gt; He made his competitive debut for the club in Dunfermline's opening league match of the season, a 2–1 defeat to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5223922.stm |title=Dunfermline Athletic 1–2 Hearts |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2006, Bamba was [[Ejection (sports)#Association football|sent off]] for the first time in his professional career after pushing [[Steven Naismith]] in the chest during a 5–1 defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/6196924.stm |title=Kilmarnock 5–1 Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at the club, Bamba was part of the squad that reached the [[2007 Scottish Cup Final]] and played in a 1–0 defeat to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/6684941.stm |title=Dunfermline 0–1 Celtic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club also suffered [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the Scottish Premier League after a seven-year spell in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/6645249.stm |title=Inverness CT 2–1 Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamba signed a two-year contract extension at the start of the [[2007–08 in Scottish football|2007–08 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/6967126.stm|title=Bamba signs a new deal with Pars|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 July 2008 | date=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension brought an end to rumours of his desire to leave the club in order to play at a higher level and further his chances of breaking into the Ivory Coast national side, having not played in any of Dunfermline's preseason matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23665181.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050014/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23665181.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=No offers for Bamba leaves Kenny uncertain over defender's future |newspaper=The Herald |date=23 July 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamba was allowed to go on trial with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in July 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watford.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=116592|title=La Bamba – Watford trial Pars soul|publisher=vitalfootball.co.uk|accessdate=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in a friendly for them against [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1349098,00.html|title=Boreham Wood 1 Watford 3|publisher=watfordfc.co.uk|accessdate=23 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919095755/http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10400~1349098%2C00.html|archivedate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, manager [[Jim McIntyre (footballer)|Jim McIntyre]] said he expected a fee to be agreed between Dunfermline and Watford, which would allow Bamba to move to the Championship side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/7526579.stm|title=Watford close in on Pars' Bamba|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 July 2008 |date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was thought to be almost complete, with Watford sending a doctor to China, where Bamba had travelled with the Ivory Coast Olympic squad, to conduct his medical.&lt;ref name="dreams"/&gt; However, Watford later pulled out for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer/08/08/21/manual_174324.html&amp;TEAMHD=nationwide1|title=Hornets pull out of Bamba deal|publisher=sportinglife.com|accessdate=22 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67H6pYljo?url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer%2F08%2F08%2F21%2Fmanual_174324.html&amp;TEAMHD=nationwide1|archivedate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Dunfermline accepted offers of [[Pound sterling|£]]50,000 for Bamba to move to either [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], keeping him in the Scottish Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/09/01/sportstory11897027t0.asp |title=Bamba on his way back to the SPL |work=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |last=Dey |first=Graeme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67H6qZXUP?url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/09/01/sportstory11897027t0.asp |archivedate=29 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hibernian===
Bamba chose to move to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], signing a three-year contract with the club.&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/7591944.stm|title=Hibs sign Bamba from Dunfermline |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the transfer deal, Dunfermline were due 10% of any future transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27610019.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822050026/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27610019.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Bamba's move to Leicester earns Dunfermline £25,000 |newspaper=The Herald |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off on his debut for a second bookable offence against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], but Bamba subsequently established himself in the Hibs first team. Despite being a natural centre back, [[manager (association football)|manager]] [[Mixu Paatelainen]] praised Bamba's performance as a [[defensive midfielder]] during a 2–0 win over Celtic in December 2008.&lt;ref name = "Mixu"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paterson |first=Colleen |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Hibs-boss-praises-Bamba-for.4773769.jp |title=Hibs boss praises Bamba for his commitment |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=9 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617043544/http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Hibs-boss-praises-Bamba-for.4773769.jp |archivedate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paatelainen commented further that he believed Bamba had improved as a player since his spell at Dunfermline, with him no longer going to ground when making a challenge,&lt;ref name = "p&amp;j"/&gt; and described him as possessing "tremendous pace and physical presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17108259.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822045951/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17108259.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Riordan reunited with his first love |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 September 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamba quickly became a popular player with the Hibs support due to his tough and committed tackling in this new role.&lt;ref name = "p&amp;j"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1000521?UserKey= |title=Powerful Bamba has made his presence felt at Easter Road |work=[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]] |location=Aberdeen |date=23 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072357/http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1000521?UserKey= |archivedate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamba was called up to the squad for 10 September 2014 fixture against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], however on 29 December 2014 he was a surprising omission from the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations squads#Ivory Coast|Ivory Coast squad]] for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30625350 |title=2015 Nations Cup: Kolo Toure in squad for last time|publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has not retired from international football, he has not appeared for the side since 2014.&lt;ref name="nft"/&gt;

==Style of play==
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quoted=1|quote=I love defending. Absolutely love it. When I go into a game I set myself a target: I don’t want to lose a header anywhere on the pitch. Sometimes I see defenders and I ask myself: ‘Does he actually like defending?’ But I love going into a tackle, winning a challenge or a header. That’s why it’s good here because the fans appreciate that. In France or in Italy, when you do a good defensive tackle, they’re not bothered. But here they like that and that makes me want to defend even more.|source=—Bamba on the art of defending, 2018&lt;ref name = "Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title= Sol Bamba: ‘The gaffer always reminds me not to be Beckenbauer’|first=Stuart|last=James|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/31/sol-bamba-love-tackle-cardiff-neil-warnock}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Chiefly a centre-back, Bamba played as a defensive midfielder during his emergence at Paris SG, before becoming a centre-back at age 15.&lt;ref name="regret" /&gt; He has sporadically played in the midfield since then, most successfully for Mixu Paatelainen at Hibs.&lt;ref name="Mixu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="p&amp;j" /&gt;

Jim Leishman, who signed Bamba at Dunfermline Athletic, said of his former charge in 2010: "He's certainly got the physique and he's got the potential to do it. But potential sometimes passes you by, it's all about going out and doing it. He's a great runner, he's as strong as an ox, and he's a strong tackler."&lt;ref name="leishman" /&gt; ''[[Sky Sports]]''' Soriebah Kajue in September 2011 said Bamba "established himself as a rock at the heart of the Foxes defence and has produced a level of consistency this year that has simply been outstanding", paying tribute to "Bamba's burgeoning reputation as a ball-playing defender".&lt;ref name="Beckenbamba" /&gt;

Sven-Göran Eriksson, who managed Bamba at club level for Leicester City and internationally for the Ivory Coast, compared the defender with Franz Beckenbauer.&lt;ref name="Beckenbamba" /&gt; Cardiff manager Neil Warnock regularly told Bamba "Don’t be Beckenbauer. Just kick or head it. When it’s on, pass it, but if it’s not on, just put it up there,"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and in December 2017 Warnock branded Bamba and fellow Cardiff centre-half [[Sean Morrison (footballer)|Sean Morrison]] as better than [[Virgil van Dijk]].&lt;ref name="qa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Bamba's favourite players growing up were [[Lilian Thuram]] and [[George Weah]].&lt;ref name="regret" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bamba met his wife Chloe while playing for Leicester. They have three children together.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Bamba is [[multilingualism|multilingual]], being able to speak [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and "the [[Languages of Ivory Coast|Ivorian dialect]] that his father used at home".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;
