His time in Spain saw him win honours including three [[La Liga]] titles, and score 107 goals in 190 league appearances. He joined Italian side [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] for €40 million in July 2013, where he won the [[Coppa Italia]] during his first season. In the [[2015–16 Serie A|2015–16 season]], he scored 36 league goals, winning the ''[[Capocannoniere]]'' title and equalling [[Gino Rossetti]]'s 87-year-old record for goals in an Italian top-flight season. As a result of his goal scoring exploits in Naples, Italian champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] signed him for €90 million in 2016, making him the most expensive South American footballer of all time (until Neymar's transfer to PSG in 2017); his transfer fee was the highest ever paid by an Italian team (until [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s transfer to Juventus in 2018) and also the highest of a player transferring within any domestic league (until [[Kylian Mbappé]]'s transfer to PSG in 2018).&lt;ref name="Gonzalo Higuaín: Argentina Striker joins Juventus from Napoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36874091|title=Gonzalo Higuain: Argentina Striker joins Juventus from Napoli|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won domestic doubles in his first two seasons with Juventus, also reaching the [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|2017 Champions League final]] with the club. In 2018, he was loaned to [[A.C. Milan]], and later in 2019 he was loaned to [[Chelsea FC]].

Higuaín has been a full international for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] since 2009; he has represented the country at three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and three [[Copa América]] tournaments, helping them to second-place finishes at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa América]], and the [[Copa América Centenario]] in 2016.

Higuaín was born on 10 December 1987 in [[Brest, France]], the son of the Argentine footballer [[Jorge Higuaín]], who was then playing for [[Stade Brestois 29]]. He is of Basque descent through his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskalkultura.com/espanol/noticias/el-delantero-uruguayo-diego-forlan-su-abuela-vasca-y-sus-deseos-de-fichar-por-el-athletic-club-de-bilbao|title=El delantero uruguayo Diego Forlán, su abuela vasca, y sus deseos de fichar por el Athlétic Club de Bilbao|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left France at the age of ten months and does not speak French, but retains [[French nationality law|French citizenship]] in addition to his [[Argentine nationality law|Argentine nationality]], which he successfully applied for in January 2007.&lt;ref name="Higuain to choose Argentina over France"/&gt; Higuaín has two elder brothers, Nicolas and [[Federico Higuaín|Federico]], the latter of whom plays for [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) club [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] as a deep-lying forward,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague=usa-mls-2000000103/news/newsid/210/340/2/index.html|title=Higuain: I’m not jealous of Gonzalo|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=18 October 2015|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one younger brother, Lautaro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.clarin.com/diario/2006/12/04/deportes/d-02001.htm Federico ganó el duelo de los hermanos Higuaín].

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Higuaín started playing in the youth teams and made his debut with [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] in a 2–1 defeat against [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP)]] on 29 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canchallena.com/1193372-higuain-los-convence-a-todos Higuain los convence a todos (Higuain convinces all)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226012709/http://www.canchallena.com/1193372-higuain-los-convence-a-todos |date=26 February 2012 }} canchallena.com, 2 November 2009, in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2006, he scored his first league goal in a 3–1 victory over [[Club Atlético Banfield|Banfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Match_List&amp;PLID=191762&amp;ListType=9&amp;TEID=543&amp;Season=2005%20-%202006&amp;mTEID=3375&amp;t=3 |title=Gonzalo Higuaín All goals 2005–2006 (Boca Juniors) |publisher=Guardian Stats |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higuaín ended the [[2005–06 Argentine Primera División|2005–06 season]] with 5 goals in 12 appearances.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=191762&amp;TEID=543 |title=Gonzalo Higuaín Facts |publisher=Guardian Stats |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127204526/http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=29&amp;CPID=68&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=191762&amp;TEID=543 |archivedate=27 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his [[brace (sports)|brace]] in the ''[[Superclásico]]'' [[Local derby|derby]] against [[Boca Juniors]] on 8 October 2006, River Plate manager [[Daniel Passarella]] declared that Higuaín had an "enormous future" and was "destined for superstardom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of [[2006–07 Argentine Primera División|that season]], he scored 10 goals in 17 league matches.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

===Real Madrid===
====2006–07 season====
In December 2006, Spanish club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] signed Higuaín for [[Euro|€]]12&amp;nbsp;million from River Plate. His debut came on 11 January 2007 against [[Real Betis]] in the second round of the [[Copa del Rey]] in [[Seville]]. His first league game came three days later, on 14 January 2007, against [[Real Zaragoza]] at home. Higuaín was involved in the creation of numerous scoring chances and in the assistance for the only goal, which earned Madrid the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/01/14/spain/primera-division/real-madrid-club-de-futbol/real-zaragoza/389446/|title=Real Madrid vs. Real Zaragoza 1 – 0|publisher=Soccerway|date=14 January 2007|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal with Real came on 24 February when the team faced [[Atlético Madrid]] in the [[Madrid derby]], the equaliser (1–1) at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/02/24/spain/primera-division/club-atletico-de-madrid/real-madrid-club-de-futbol/389502/|title=Atlético Madrid vs. Real Madrid 1 – 1|publisher=Soccerway|date=24 February 2007|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first season at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Bernabéu]], however, Higuaín raised some doubts over his performance due to his overall lack of goals.

====2007–08 season====
During the [[2007–08 Real Madrid C.F. season|2007–08 season]], Higuaín played inconsistently, although he finished strongly at the end of the season: He first scored a last minute goal to earn his team a victory in a 2–1 comeback against [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], which allowed Real Madrid to be mathematically crowned Liga champions for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2007_08/primera/jornada_35/osa_rma/asilovivimos.html |title=www.Marca.com |publisher=Marca.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he scored the third goal of a 4–1 thrashing of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in ''[[El Clásico]]''. The goal was scored just 57 seconds after he came off the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/Barca/saca/hombros/Madrid/elpepidep/20080508elpepidep_2/Tes |title=El Barça saca a hombros al Madrid |work=El Pais |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
In the [[2008–09 Real Madrid C.F. season|2008–09 season]], Higuaín was offered the chance to be a starter due to a serious injury suffered by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/Higuain/Espero/lesion/Van/Nistelrooy/signifique/retirada/elpepudep/20081113elpepudep_17/Tes |title=Higuaín: "Espero que la lesión de Van Nistelrooy no signifique su retirada" |work=El Pais |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Higuaín scored the winner in Madrid's victory over [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the [[Supercopa de España]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivo.marca.com/futbol/2008/supercopa/index.html Supercopa 2008] Marca.com. Retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he scored all four goals in a 4–3 win against [[Málaga CF|Málaga]]. Because of this, he started to gain international recognition and became one of the leading goalscorers of La Liga, alongside his Barcelona counterpart [[Samuel Eto'o]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/2008/11/08/mardid_malaga_recap/ |title=Higuain, Eto'o both notch four goals |publisher=Sportsnet.ca |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315014049/http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/2008/11/08/mardid_malaga_recap/ |archive-date=15 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2009, Higuaín played very well in the match against [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] and scored the decisive goal in the last minute, giving Real Madrid a 3–2 victory which enabled the team to keep close to [[Pep Guardiola]]'s Barcelona in the league table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/higuain-casillas-especialistas-milagros/20090421dasdasftb_60/Tes |title=Higuaín y Casillas, especialistas en milagros – LIGA BBVA , Real Madrid 3 – Getafe 2 |publisher=AS.com |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season, Higuaín was regarded as one of the most promising talents in world football in the wake of spectacular games and last-minute goals. He ended the season with 22 league goals&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/topscorers?league=esp.1&amp;year=2008&amp;cc=5901 Spanish Primera División – Top Scorers – 2008/2009]. ESPN. Retrieved on 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 24 in all competitions, around as many as established football stars including [[Diego Forlán]], [[David Villa]] and [[Thierry Henry]].

====2009–10 season====
The [[2009–10 Real Madrid C.F. season|2009–10 season]] saw Higuaín become Real's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, 29 in total, being at the same time the La Liga's second-top goalscorer, behind only [[Lionel Messi]] and surpassing Swedish international [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], as well as his Madrid teammate [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. This season included him scoring his first two goals in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and his second [[hat-trick]] for the club.

====2010–11 season====

Due to Higuaín's availability, clubs like [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] were keen to sign him. Higuaín was at the centre of much transfer speculation, with many newspapers linking him to a move to Arsenal before Napoli's president [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]] said that Higuaín, along with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] goalkeeper [[Pepe Reina]], had passed their medicals and that the Argentine had signed a five-year deal with the [[Italy|Italian]] club, with Higuaín joining for [[Euro|€]]40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=1506002&amp;cc=5901 |title=Higuain and Reina pass Napoli medicals |publisher=ESPNFC |date=24 July 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, Napoli confirmed the signing of Higuaín, with the Argentine being assigned the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=1508152&amp;cc=5901 |title=Napoli confirm Higuain signing |publisher=ESPNFC |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Copa América Centenario]] in 2016, Higuaín was named to [[Gerardo Martino]]'s 23-man Argentina squad, and was selected as his team's starting centre forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/argentina/story/2876914/carlos-tevez-paulo-dybala-left-off-argentinas-copa-america-squad|title=Carlos Tevez, Paulo Dybala left off Argentina's Copa America squad|publisher=ESPN FC|date=20 May 2016|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June, he scored twice in the team's 4–1 quarter-final defeat of Venezuela.&lt;ref name=MOTM-ARG-VEN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2016.com/matches/27|title=Match 27 : Argentina vs Venezuela|publisher=[[Copa América Centenario]]|date=18 June 2016|access-date=18 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618000735/http://www.ca2016.com/matches/27|archivedate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he once again scored two goals as Argentina defeated the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 4–0 in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36593966|title=Lionel Messi breaks record as Argentina reach Copa America final|date=22 June 2016|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the [[Copa América Centenario Final|final]] against Chile eight days later, a repeat of the previous year's final, as the ''Albiceleste'' once again lost in a penalty shootout following a 0–0 draw after extra time. Following the match, Higuaín once again came under criticism in the media for squandering a one on one opportunity for the third consecutive final with Argentina.&lt;ref name="Higuain's grim record in finals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jun/26/copa-america-2016-final-argentina-chile-live-score|title=Chile beat Argentina on penalties to win Copa América – as it happened|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Tom Lutz|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/xxx-wins-copa-america-centenario-title/|title=Argentina falls to Chile in Copa America Centenario final|publisher=Sportsnet.ca|date=26 June 2016|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 World Cup===
During Argentina's troublesome [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualifying campaign]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, Higuaín only managed one goal in nine appearances, and eventually lost his place in the team's starting line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player/271550/profile/ |title=2018 FIFA World Cup Profile: Gonzalo Higuaín |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, however, Higuaín was included in [[Jorge Sampaoli]]'s final 23-man Argentina squad for the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/argentina-world-cup-squad-paulo-dybala-mauro-icardi-a8362096.html |title=Argentina World Cup squad: Paulo Dybala included but Mauro Icardi misses out on 23-man group for Russia |publisher=The Independent |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=17 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in all three group matches for Argentina, but went scoreless throughout the competition, and did not feature in the round of 16 match against [[France national football team|France]] on 30 June, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup following a 4–3 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/43976007 |title=France 4–3 Argentina |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Emlyn Begley |date=30 June 2018  |accessdate=30 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/06/30/france-vs-argentina-world-cup-2018-live-score-lionel-messi-latest/ |title=Kylian Mbappe destroys Argentina to send Lionel Messi and co home in World Cup thriller |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=Sam Wallace |date=1 July 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player/271550/ |title=Gonzalo Higuaín |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A hardworking striker and a prolific goalscorer, Higuaín is considered to be one of the top strikers of his generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/09/strikers-premier-league-gonzalo-higuain|title=Every club wants one but where have all the (good) strikers gone?|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Amy Lawrence|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/75003/prandelli-%E2%80%98higuain-best-around%E2%80%99|title=Prandelli: ‘Higuain best around’|publisher=Football Italia|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known in particular for his great striking ability,&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnapoli.it/Squadra/Gonzalo-Higuain|title=Prima Squadra – SSC Napoli|publisher=|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212070151/http://www.sscnapoli.it/Squadra/Gonzalo-Higuain|archive-date=12 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his opportunism and clinical finishing inside the penalty area, while his height, eye for goal, and strong physique make him a dangerous aerial presence in the box. He also possesses good technical skills, and an ability to link-up with teammates, hold up the ball, and lay it off to other players. His intelligent offensive movement off the ball and pace in the final third of the pitch make him an offensive threat during counter-attacks, and also allow him to lose his markers and get on the end of passes, or create space for his teammates with his attacking runs.&lt;ref name="El Pìpita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brilliant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2440254.html|title=How brilliant is Juventus' Gonzalo Higuaín?|publisher=UEFA.com|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higuaín Finds Comfort in Columbus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/higuain-finds-comfort-in-columbus/|title=Higuaín Finds Comfort in Columbus|publisher=The New York Times|author=Eric Beard|date=14 September 2012|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his team-play, he has also operated as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]] on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/116818/crespo-%E2%80%99play-icardi-higuain%E2%80%99 |title=Crespo: ’Play Icardi with Higuain’ |publisher=Football Italia |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=2 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-struggling-juventus-max-10213736 |title=With Arsene Wenger struggling, Juventus' Max Allegri gave Arsenal food for thought with spot-on tactics to stun Barcelona |publisher=The Daily Mirror |author1=Darren Lewis |date=12 April 2017 |accessdate=2 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His playing style has earned him comparisons with compatriots [[Hernán Crespo]] and Gabriel Batistuta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2011/10/18/2717055/hernan-crespo-real-madrids-gonzalo-higuain-is-my-natural|title=Hernan Crespo: Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higuain is my natural successor in the Argentina national team|publisher=Goal.com|author1=Daniel Edwards|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penpix of likely Argentina squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-world-penpix-argentina-idUSKBN0DF06J20140429|title=Penpix of likely Argentina squad for World Cup finals|publisher=Reuters|author1=Rex Gowar|date=28 April 2014|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his impressive scoring record, Higuaín has often been criticized for failing to deliver in the most important of matches for both club and country. Notable examples include poor performances in cup finals and crucial [[UEFA Champions League]] matches during his tenures at Real Madrid, Napoli and Juventus, as well as notable missed chances for the Argentina national team in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|2014 World Cup Final]], the [[2015 Copa América Final]] and the [[Copa América Centenario Final]].&lt;ref name="Higuain's grim record in finals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/06/05/593573fd46163f84608b45be.html|title=Higuain's grim record in finals|publisher=Marca.com|author1=Joel del Río|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
