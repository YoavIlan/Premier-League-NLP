'''Martin Stanford Peters''' {{Post-nominals|country=UK|MBE}} (born 8 November 1943) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] and manager and a member of the [[England national football team|England]] team which won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] as well as playing in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|174852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], [[Essex]], he played club football for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. He briefly managed Sheffield United before retiring from professional football in 1981.

Known as "the complete midfielder" as he could pass the ball well with either foot, was good in the air and difficult to mark because of his movement.&lt;ref name=pamp&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.performingartistes.co.uk/artistes/769/martin-peters.htm|publisher=www.performingartistes.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free kick specialist, Peters was described by England manager [[Sir Alf Ramsey]], after a game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1968, as being "ten years ahead of his time".&lt;ref name=10years&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin Peters: I can't see us ending 44 years of hurt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/martin-peters-i-cant-see-us-ending-44-years-of-hurt-1924707.html|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=www.independent.co.uk|date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His versatility was such that while he was at West Ham he played in every position in the team, including goalkeeper in his third game, replacing an injured [[Brian Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=pamp/&gt; With his transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, he became Britain's first £200,000 footballer.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt;

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Under manager [[Ted Fenton]],&lt;ref name=Academy&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Andrews|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9544033/Jimmy-Andrews.html|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peters came through the productive ranks at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] after signing as an [[apprentice]] in 1959. He made his debut on [[Good Friday]] 1962 in a 4–1 home win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6–1 away win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 8 September 1962.&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Martin Peter|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=524&amp;united=Martin_Peters|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters played only five games in his first season with West Ham and although he played 32 league games in season 1963–4 he played no part in their FA Cup run and was not selected for the [[FA Cup]] final of 1964 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], in which West Ham beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3–2.&lt;ref name=1964facup&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Cup Final 1964 - Preston 2 West Ham 3 |url=http://www.football-england.com/fa_cup_final_1964_preston_west_ham.html |publisher=www.football-england.com |accessdate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020012103/http://www.football-england.com/fa_cup_final_1964_preston_west_ham.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, however, he established himself as a first team regular and was victorious at Wembley when West Ham won the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] with victory over [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]].&lt;ref name=FA&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/P/Martin-Peters|publisher=www.thefa.com|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was usually partnered in midfield by [[Eddie Bovington]] and [[Ronnie Boyce]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

Peters began to impose himself on West Ham's game, and another chance for silverware came in 1966 when West Ham reached the [[1966 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] final. The occasion was still a two-legged affair with each of the finalists hosting a leg (though this changed to a one-off final at Wembley a year later), and Peters played in both matches. He scored in the second game but opponents [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] emerged as 5–3 winners on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On this day - 2 February|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120202/on-this-day-2-february_2236884_2597541|publisher=www.whufc.com|accessdate=19 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209125803/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120202/on-this-day-2-february_2236884_2597541|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played on 09 Mar 1966|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2479&amp;united=09_Mar_1966|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played on 23 Mar 1966|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2483&amp;united=23_Mar_1966|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968–69 season saw Peters's only [[hat-trick]] for West Ham in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref name=whu3&gt;{{cite web|title=Game played 31 Aug 1968|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=2599&amp;united=31_Aug_1968|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also his most prolific season, 24 goals coming from 48 games.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Feeling he was in the shadows of [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Geoff Hurst]], Peters sought out a new challenge. In March 1970, West Ham received a record-breaking £200,000 (£150,000 cash) for Peters from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and Peters moved to White Hart Lane, with Spurs and England striker [[Jimmy Greaves]] (valued at £50,000) going the other way.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|last=Smith| first=Tony| url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/tottenham-hotspur-fc/martin-peters-8744/biography-of-his-football-career-at-spurs_a12073/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1970 Peters scored on his Spurs debut against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; He won his first domestic winners' medal in 1971 when Spurs beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 2–0 in the [[1971 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]].&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; Spurs beat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 3–2 on aggregate to win the 1972 [[UEFA Cup]] in what remained the only all-English European final until Manchester United beat Chelsea in the UEFA Champion's League Final, 2008.&lt;ref name=whu2thfc/&gt; In 1973, Peters won the League Cup again with Spurs. He completed one more season with Spurs – losing the 1974 UEFA Cup final to [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Cup 1973-74 |first=James M. |last=Ross |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2018 |url= http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec197374.html#uefa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – before moving to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] – managed by his former West Ham teammate [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] – in March 1975 for £50,000.&lt;ref name=thfc2ncfc/&gt;

===Norwich City===
Peters, now aged 31, made his debut appearance for Norwich on 15 March 1975 in a 1–1 away draw to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref name=thfc2ncfc&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/norwich-city-fc/martin-peters-8744/1974-75-1979-80_a17360/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He helped newly promoted Norwich establish themselves in the First Division, making more than 200 appearances, and earning a testimonial against an all-star team which included most of the 1966 World Cup winning England XI. He was voted [[Norwich City F.C. Player of the Season]] two years running, in 1976 and 1977, and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=NCFC-fftn&gt;{{cite web|title=Flown from the nest - Martin Peters|url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/peters-martin.htm|publisher=www.ex-canaries.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, whilst still a Norwich City player, Peters was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to [[association football]].&lt;ref name=mbe&gt;{{cite web|title=Hammers Awarded and Managers|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=3|publisher=www.westhamstats.info|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheffield United===
He joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 31 July 1980 as player-coach with the intention of replacing [[Harry Haslam (footballer)|Harry Haslam]] as manager. His first appearance came in a 2–1 victory against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 2 August 1980 in the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] and his League debut came in the opening match of the season in a Division Three fixture against [[Carlisle United]]. He scored once in a 3–0 victory.

==International career==
[[File:Champions statue.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Peters (left) as part of [[World Cup Sculpture|The Champions statue]], [[Newham]], London]]
[[Alf Ramsey]] had seen Peters' potential quickly, and in May 1966 he gave the young midfielder his debut for England against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] at Wembley.&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/P/Martin-Peters|publisher=The FA.com|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won 2–0 and Peters had an outstanding debut. Nearly scoring twice he set up chances for Jimmy Greaves and for others.&lt;ref name=englanddebut&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup hero Martin Peters made his England debut on this day.|url=https://www.thefa.com/England/News/2010/OTD_040510|publisher=www.thefa.com|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final preparation period for Ramsey prior to naming his squad for the World Cup, Peters played in two more of the scheduled warm-up games. Against [[Finland national football team|Finland]], he scored his first international goal in what was only his second appearance,&lt;ref name=finland&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.englandcaps.co.uk/martinpeters.html|publisher=www.englandcaps.co.uk|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently he made Ramsey's squad for the competition, as did his West Ham teammates [[Bobby Moore]] (the England captain) and [[Geoff Hurst]].&lt;ref name=1966squad&gt;{{cite news|last=Norrish|first=Mike|title=England v Germany all-time greats: where are they now?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/3472121/England-v-Germany-all-time-greats-where-are-they-now-Football.html|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Peters did not play in the opening group game against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], the drab 0–0 draw prompted Ramsey into changes.&lt;ref name=fa/&gt; The England coach had been toying with using a system which allowed narrow play through the centre, not operating with conventional wingers but instead with fitter, centralised players who could show willing in defence as well as spread the ball and their runs in attack. Peters therefore had become an ideal player for this 4–1-3-2 system, elegant in his distribution and strong in his forward running, yet showing the stamina, discipline and pace to get back and help the defence when required. This system was dubbed "the wingless wonders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/heritage/hampshire100/100sport/1484615.Sir_Alf_Ramsey/ | title=Sir Alf Ramsey | publisher=www.dailyecho.co.uk | date=20 June 2007 | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=44549/index.html | title=Ramsey. Alf | publisher=FIFA.com | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey put Peters in the team for his fourth cap, for the second group game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], which England won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 16.07.1966 England vs Mexico|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13755|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept his place as England got through their group, scraped past a violent [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] side in the quarter finals (Peters' late cross set up Hurst's header for the only goal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 23.07.1966 England vs Argentina|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13767|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the last four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 26.07.1966 England vs Portugal|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13769|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[West Germany national football team|Germans]] awaited in the final.

A tense but open game at Wembley saw the score at 1–1 in the final quarter of an hour when England won a corner. [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] delivered it to the edge of the area to Hurst, who tried a shot on the turn. The ball deflected high into the air and bounced down into the penalty area where Peters rifled home a half-volley. The Germans equalised in the final seconds, though glory would still come the team's way with the 4–2 win in extra time, and Hurst – like Peters, winning only his eighth cap – completing a historic hat-trick.&lt;ref name=1966video&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 1966 - England beat Germany in Wembley final|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8388240.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico Peters played in England's three group games from which they qualified again with West Germany waiting in the last eight. Peters scored against the Germans again early in the second half – a run and finish from behind a defender which no West German player had spotted – to establish a 2–0 lead, but later Ramsey committed a tactical error by [[substitute (soccer)|substituting]] Peters and [[Bobby Charlton]] with [[Colin Bell]] and [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]], and West Germany won 3–2 in extra-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 14.06.1970 England vs West Germany|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=11591|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mpengland&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Peters|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/martin-peters-8744/english-caps-1966-74_a12075/|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Peters won his 50th England cap in a qualifier for the [[1972 European Football Championship|1972 European Championships]], beating [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 3–2.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; England failed to progress due to another defeat against West Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International football MATCH report: 29.04.1972 England vs West Germany|url=http://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=11821|publisher=www.eu-football.info|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who went on to win the tournament. International disappointment for Peters was tempered mildly by more club success, and he scored the only goal as England beat [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at Wembley on 19 May 1973.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; It was his 20th goal for his country and would prove to be his last. England had been stuttering in their qualifying campaign for the [[Football World Cup 1974|1974 World Cup]], dropping points in a drawn game against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and then a 2–0 defeat against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in [[Chorzów]] on 6 June 1973.&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; England needed to defeat Poland at Wembley on 17 October 1973 to qualify for the finals in Germany and, with an out-of-form Moore dropped from the side (he'd only play once more subsequently for his country) Peters captained the side for the crucial game. A defensive error allowed Poland to score and only a penalty allowed England to level up quickly. [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] scored from it, but England could not get the crucial winning goal. Poland went through after the match finished 1–1 meaning Peters would not play in a third successive World Cup competition.
At the age of 30, Peters' career at the highest level began to slip away. He played three more games for England,&lt;ref name=mpengland/&gt; reaching a total of 67 caps, though his career with his country ended, on 18 May 1974, as England lost 2–0 against Scotland at [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref name=fa/&gt;

==Management career==
His wait to become manager was not long, his final game coming against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 17 January 1981 which Haslam was too ill to attend, and at which there were demonstrations from the Sheffield United fans. Peters retired to take up the manager's job the following day with United 12th in the table with 16 games to play, but was unable to halt the decline already in place, winning just three of the remaining games. For the first and only time in their history Sheffield United were relegated to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], and Peters resigned.&lt;ref name=Haslem&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Martin|title=Biog of managers from the 1974-75 season|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/sport/the_damned_united/4938702/Biog-of-managers-from-the-1974-75-season.html|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his retirement from professional football in January 1981, after a distinguished and injury-free career, he had made 882 appearances in total, scoring 220 goals. After he quit Sheffield United Peters spent the 1982–83 season playing in defence for [[Gorleston F.C.|Gorleston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://members.multimania.co.uk/gorlestonfc/history.HTM | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718033312/http://members.multimania.co.uk/gorlestonfc/history.HTM | dead-url=yes | archive-date=18 July 2012 | work=Gorleston FC History | location=Norfolk | title=Gorleston FC History | first=, | last=Gorleston FC | date=8 April 2006 | accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Eastern Counties League]].
