==Career==
===Darlington===
Born in [[Blyth, Northumberland]],&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Burn grew up supporting [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and idolised [[Alan Shearer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/december/10/burn-baby-burn |title=Burn Baby Burn |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908153037/http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/december/10/burn-baby-burn |archivedate=8 September 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released by Newcastle United at age 11, Burn played youth football for local teams New Hartley, [[Blyth Town F.C.|Blyth Town]] and [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspostleader.co.uk/sport/football/on-fire-burn-living-the-dream-at-wembley-1-5714070 |title=On-fire Burn living the dream at Wembley |publisher=News Post Leader |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/03/17/dan-burn-couldnt-get-fulham-team-nobody-wanted-loan-now-want/ |title=Dan Burn hoping unconventional journey from pushing Asda trollies to silencing Sergio Aguero takes him back to Wembley |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 March 2018 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, he began working for supermarket [[Asda]], when a scout for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] saw him playing for Blyth Spartans and he signed on professional terms on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newcastle360.com/2017/03/23/exclusive-qa-wigan-athletics-geordie-defender-dan-burn/ |title=Exclusive Q&amp;A with Wigan Athletic's Geordie defender Dan Burn |publisher=Newcastle 360 |accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~1737521,00.html |title=YOUTH CONTINUE PREPERATIONS&lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |publisher=Darlington F.C. |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831030712/http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10339~1737521%2C00.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the club's financial problems and lack of available players, Burn was promoted to the first team for the first time and appeared as an unused substitute, in a 3–1 loss against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on 31 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~1842466,00.html |title=MILLER STRUGGLING FOR HEREFORD TRIP |publisher=Hereford United F.C. |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612181048/http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10339~1842466%2C00.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn then made his away league debut coming on as a 19th-minute substitute for injured defender [[Mark Bower]] against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on 12 December 2009, which resulted in a 5–0 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Torquay United 5–0 Darlington |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8398178.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn then made his first start in another encounter against Torquay United on 6 March 2010, which saw Darlington lost 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darlington 1–3 Torquay United |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8541674.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 March 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he made four appearance in the 2009–10 season, the club, however, were relegated to the Conference.

After this, Burn was sent back to the academy in order to develop more throughout the whole 2010 and soon recalled to the first team once again by Manager [[Mark Cooper (footballer, born 1968)|Mark Cooper]], where he made his first appearance of the 2010–11 season, in a 3–1 win against [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] on 3 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darlington 3–1 Barrow |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9313946.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn was given a handful of first team appearances, where he went on to make ten appearance in the 2010–11 season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burn to keep his place |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8853827.Burn_to_keep_his_place/ |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his performance was praised by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cooper impressed with Darlington defender |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8802484.Cooper_impressed_with_Darlington_defender/ |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn finished second behind [[Jamie Chandler]] for the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chandler takes the Darlington honour |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/9038578.Chandler_takes_the_Darlington_honour/ |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burn's performance attracted interests from [[Premier League]] clubs, including Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burn deal still has some way to go |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8969780.Burn_deal_still_has_some_way_to_go/ |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the club made an improved contract for Burn, Manager Cooper said it would be unlikely to keep Burn the following season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark Cooper sings praises of Burn |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8936616.Cooper_sings_praises_of_Burn/ |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he believed that Burn could play in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darlington boss Cooper tips Dan Burn for higher level |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/12906489 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
