On 23 November 2006 Arsenal announced he was going on loan to Bournemouth until 2 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/6177378.stm|title=Cherries sign Arsenal youngster|publisher=BBC Sport|work=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total he played seven games for Bournemouth (five in [[Football League One|League One]] and two in the [[FA Cup]]), and scored his first goal at senior level in a 2–0 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], on 5 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2007 Arsenal announced he would be spending the whole of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08]] season on loan to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/matthew-connolly-joins-colchester-on-loan | title=Matthew Connolly joins Colchester United on loan | publisher=Arsenal F.C. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135454/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/matthew-connolly-joins-colchester-on-loan | archivedate=5 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he eventually was recalled midway through the loan on 2 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/colchester_united/7165220.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Colchester to lose on-loan Gunner | date=30 December 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queens Park Rangers===
The same day, his transfer to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] was announced, after a lack of first-team opportunities were offered by Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11711/3015996/connolly-links-up-with-qpr | work=Sky Sports | title=Sky Sports – Football – Premier League – News – Connolly links up with QPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut came on 5 January, in a 1–0 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[FA Cup]]. He scored his first goal for QPR against Blackpool on 16 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=16 January 2010
|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the meantime, in November, he received his first call-up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U-21 squad]], where he joined Arsenal teammate [[Theo Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/reserves-news/matt-connolly-called-up-for-under-21-action|title=Matt Connolly called up for Under-21 action|website=Arsenal.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070434/http://www.arsenal.com/news/reserves-news/matt-connolly-called-up-for-under-21-action|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came on 6 March against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in a 3–1 win.

During the 2010–11 season, Connolly played a part in QPR's Championship title win playing 36 out of 43 games.

He joined Reading on a loan on 31 January 2012 until the end of the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading sign QPR defender Matthew Connolly on loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16812181.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royals swoop for Matthew Connolly |url=http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~2594815,00.html |publisher=Reading Football Club |accessdate=31 January 2012 |date=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418043507/http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10306~2594815%2C00.html |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 11 February 2012 in a 2–0 win against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. He only played 6 times during Reading's promotion push which resulted in Reading winning the Championship title.

===Cardiff City===
[[File:Matthew Connolly.jpg|thumb|upright|Connolly playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2012]]

On 20 August 2012, QPR had accepted a £500,000 bid from [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for Connolly's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City close to signing QPR defender Matthew Connolly |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-close-signing-qpr-2026055 |work=South Wales Echo |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, the deal was completed and Connolly signed a contract that would keep him at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DEAL DONE: CONNOLLY SIGNS FOR CITY |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2896709,00.html |work=Cardiff City FC |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824211423/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2896709%2C00.html |archivedate=24 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the [[Severnside derby]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on 25 August. He scored his first and second goal for the club in a 3–0 win over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 29 September. His third goal came a month later against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and later scored his fourth against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Making thirty-six appearances and scoring five goals, Connolly was a key figure as Cardiff won the [[2012-13 Football League Championship|Championship]] title, the third time in successive seasons that Connolly has achieved the feat.

[[File:Matthew Connolly 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Connolly playing for Cardiff City in 2015.]]
He started the [[Premier League]] season playing at right back until new signing [[Kevin Theophile-Catherine]] became a permanent fixture in the side. Cardiff were relegated after just one season in the top flight. Connolly had then returned to the starting eleven partnering [[Mark Hudson (footballer, born 1982)|Mark Hudson]] in a 1–1 draw at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn Rovers 1–1 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28646428 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2014 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2015 Connolly joined another Championship side, [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], on loan until the end of the [[2014–15 in English football|2014–15 season]], despite having played 26 times for Cardiff that season. Manager [[Russell Slade]] stated the deal was a business rather than a footballing decision, with Connolly expressing his surprise at the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matt Connolly says the Watford squad is more talented than the QPR, Reading and Cardiff City sides he was promoted to the Premier League with |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/12869600.Connolly__Talent_in_Watford_squad_is_better_than_teams_I_ve_been_promoted_with/ |work=Watford Observer |date=6 April 2015 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst at Watford, Connolly achieved the feat of being promoted to the [[Premier League]] for the fourth time with four different clubs (QPR, Reading, Cardiff and Watford). At Watford Connolly scored once; in a 3–1 win at Nottingham Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Nottm Forest 1–3 Watford
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]
|date=15 April 2015
|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connolly rejoined the Cardiff squad for the [[2015–16 Cardiff City F.C. season|2015–16 season]], earning himself a permanent place in the side alongside [[Sean Morrison (footballer)|Sean Morrison]]. He had become of interest to other clubs during the January transfer window, due to his impressive performances that season. These feats thus earned him a contract extension till 2019 and also the club's Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Connolly signs long-term deal |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/connolly-signs-long-term-city-deal-2908639.aspx |work=Cardiff City F.C. |publisher=Official Site |date=19 January 2016  |accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Player &gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City end of season awards RECAP: Matt Connolly named Player of the Year |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-end-season-awards-11299527 |work=Wales Online |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
