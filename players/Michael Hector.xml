==== Non-League ====
In October 2009, Hector joined [[Bracknell Town F.C.|Bracknell Town]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]], spending a month there before moving to [[Didcot Town F.C.|Didcot Town]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getwokingham.co.uk/sport/football/goalpost/s/2058952_bracknell_town_fc_2_frome_town_fc_3 |last=Freeland |first=Darrell |title=Bracknell Town FC 2 Frome Town FC 3 |newspaper=Wokingham Times |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.didcottownfc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=738&amp;Itemid=152 |title=Tiverton 1–2 Didcot Town |publisher=Didcot Town F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202225041/http://www.didcottownfc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=738&amp;Itemid=152 |archivedate=2 February 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went out on loan one further time that season, joining [[Conference South]] side [[Havant &amp; Waterlooville F.C.|Havant &amp; Waterlooville]] in January 2010 though he made just one appearance as a substitute against [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]].&lt;ref name="Total appearances by player: Michael Hector"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.havantandwaterlooville.net/stats/appsbyall.asp?p=269 |title=Total appearances by player: Michael Hector |publisher=Havant &amp; Waterlooville F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing in the reserves and gaining experience out on loan, Hector was rewarded with his first professional contract at Reading in May 2010.&lt;ref name="Michael Hector"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~2085332,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805122702/http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~2085332,00.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=5 August 2012 |title=Unknown |publisher=Reading F.C |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/sport/football/readingfc/s/2070721_thorvaldsson_and_bozanic_released |title=Thorvaldsson and Bozanic released |newspaper=Reading Post |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010–11 season again saw Hector go out on several loan spells. He joined [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] in August 2010 along with fellow Reading defender [[Jack Mills (English footballer)|Jack Mills]] and made seven appearances during a one-month stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/sport/8345458.FOOTBALL__Brooks_leaves_Oxford_City_as_three_arrive/ |title=Brooks leaves Oxford City as three arrive |newspaper=Oxford Mail |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hector then moved to [[Horsham F.C.|Horsham]] in November on an initial one-month loan and scored his first career goal on debut against [[Billericay Town F.C.|Billericay Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hornetsreview.co.uk/Archive/2010-11/Billericay%28h%29.htm |title=Horsham 1 Bellericay Town 2 |publisher=Horsham F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202919/http://www.hornetsreview.co.uk/Archive/2010-11/Billericay%28h%29.htm |archivedate=26 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December his loan was extended for a second month after which he returned to Reading having made 12 appearances, scoring once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/horsham-extend-hector-loan-1-1808795 |title=Horsham extend Hector loan |newspaper=West Sussex County Times |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His spell at Horsham was marred by three red cards, including two dismissals in successive games prompting manager John Maggs to accuse referees of "destroying" the young defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/sport/football/local-football/maggs-slams-referees-over-hector-red-cards-1-2335627 |title=Maggs slams referees over Hector red cards |newspaper=West Sussex County Times |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dundalk ====
On 1 February 2011, days after returning from Horsham, Hector joined [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] side [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] on loan until 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dundalkfc.com/ian-foster-update/ |title=Foster welcomes double capture |publisher=Dundalk F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red cards received during his time at Horsham meant Hector was unable to officially sign for Dundalk until 16 February though he played in four pre-season friendlies in the meantime.&lt;ref name="Focus on Hector!"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dundalkfc.com/focus-on-hector/ |title=Focus on Hector! |publisher=Dundalk F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His competitive debut came on 4 March as a substitute in the opening day league fixture against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and he made a further 14 appearances in all competitions, scoring twice.&lt;ref name="First team squad: Michael Hector"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dundalkfc.com/players-2013/first-team-squad/michael-hector/ |title=First team squad: Michael Hector |publisher=Dundalk F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dundalk had initially hoped to extend Hector's loan for the rest of the season, he suffered a knee injury in May and he returned to Reading the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dundalkfc.com/hector-to-remain-with-reading/ |title=Hector to remain with Reading |publisher=Dundalk F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Football League ====
Hector spent the next five months working his way back to full fitness and on 3 November he joined [[EFL League Two|League Two]] side [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on an initial one-month youth loan.&lt;ref name="Reading FC defender knows he has a Hec of a chance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15582242 |title=Barnet sign defenders Paul Downing and Michael Hector |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an impressive start to his spell his loan was extended for a further month, and, on 23 December, was renewed until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/9387426.Bees_extend_Hector_loan_until_January/ |last=Newson |first=Adam |title=Reading defender Michael Hector's loan spell at Barnet extended until January |newspaper=Barnet &amp; Potters Bar Times |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london24.com/sport/barnet_extend_loans_of_reading_and_west_brom_youngsters_1_1162334 |title=Barnet extend loans of Reading and West Brom youngsters |publisher=London 24 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108063003/http://www.london24.com/sport/barnet_extend_loans_of_reading_and_west_brom_youngsters_1_1162334 |archivedate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a regular in the first team and at the end of the season he was voted Barnet's Young Player of the Season.&lt;ref name="Player Profile: Michael Hector"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctfc.com/team/player-profile/index.aspx?playerid=451949&amp;tcmuri=632224 |title=Player Profile: Michael Hector |publisher=Cheltenham Town F.C |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212061259/http://www.ctfc.com/team/player-profile/index.aspx?playerid=451949&amp;tcmuri=632224 |archivedate=12 February 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Hector's contract up at the end of the 2011–12 season, his performances at Barnet attracted the attention of other clubs with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] reportedly interested in signing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11709/7493982/Duo-eye-Royals-starlet |title=Duo eye Royals starlet |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
