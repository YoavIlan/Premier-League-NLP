'''Thomas Cairney''' (born 20 January 1991) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Fulham}} club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. Cairney has previously played for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Born in England, he made his full international debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in March 2017. Cairney had previously represented Scotland at [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels.

==Early life==
Cairney was born and raised in [[Nottingham]], Nottinghamshire, to a Scottish father, who worked as a miner and then as a taxi driver.&lt;ref name="Cairney Daily Record"/&gt; He also revealed that his father would take him to Scotland and watch [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a youngster.&lt;ref name="Cairney Daily Record"/&gt; When he was about 15 or 16, he worked for Barclays Bank for work experience. He described this as the "worst two weeks of [his] life!" and had to work 9–5 in a bank and wear suit and tie for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rovers.co.uk/news/2014/september/getting-personal-with-tom-cairney/|title='Getting Personal' with Tom Cairney|publisher=Blackburn Rovers F.C.|date=15 September 2014|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906205737/https://www.rovers.co.uk/news/2014/september/getting-personal-with-tom-cairney/|archivedate=7 September 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Cairney was released from the [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] youth system at the age of 16 after being told he was too small. He had been with the club since the age of seven.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio Humberside"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sports Talk|network=BBC|station=BBC Radio Humberside|location=Hull|airdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull look likely to benefit from Cairney's keenness to prove Leeds wrong|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/hull-look-likely-to-benefit-from-cairney-s-keenness-to-prove-leeds-wrong-1-2559976 |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=2 February 2010|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on his time at Leeds United, he said: "To be honest it crushed me, it crushed me a lot, I was with Leeds from I was seven to 16 so it was a big part of my life. I was going there three-four times a week, missing days of schools, and obviously my mum and dad had put a lot into it too. So getting released at 16, it just felt like, ‘oh no, after all that effort’. But I was determined I would not stop there. I went to Hull and they offered me a YTS as they obviously saw something. And from 16–18 I shot up in height and then it went back to my footballing ability. From getting released at 16 to making my Premier League debut – if you wrote it down you wouldn't believe it. I owe a lot to (then Hull manager) [[Phil Brown (footballer, born 1959)|Phil Brown]] as he believed in me. I think the academy staff at Leeds must have got a bit of a shock when they saw me playing in the Premier League! I don’t know what happened to them but I think they may have got a telling off!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leeds United release left me crushed but it also inspired me, says Blackburn Rovers star Tom Cairney|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/11315829.Leeds_United_release_left_me_crushed_but_it_also_inspired_me__says_Blackburn_Rovers_star_Tom_Cairney/ |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |location=Blackburn |date=3 July 2014|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
