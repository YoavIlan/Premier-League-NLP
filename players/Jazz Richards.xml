He established himself in Fulham's first team for a brief period. In 2016, he returned to Cardiff City, helping the club win promotion to the Premier League in 2018.

Richards made his full international debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 2012, and represented the nation at [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. To date, he has won 14 caps for his country.

Born in [[Swansea]], Richards played local football for his schools and local club [[West End F.C.|West End]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=XSccn3-CkRc|title=The Biggest Keeper In The World vs The Angriest Keeper In The World - West End Vs Caldicot Town|website=YouTube|date=2 May 2018|accessdate=24 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; before joining the [[Cardiff City F.C. Academy|Cardiff City Academy]]. After two seasons, he was released and joined the [[Swansea City A.F.C. Under-23s#Swansea City Academy|academy]] at their [[South Wales derby|South Wales]] rivals [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name="Richards Swansea City"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/2016-17/ten-years-at-the-liberty-a-comeback-to-be-proud-of-3142840.aspx |title=Ten Years At The Liberty: A comeback to be proud of |publisher=Swansea City A.F.C. |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards initially started out as a midfielder but switched to playing as a defender under manager [[Roberto Martínez]] due to the increased competition between midfielders in the first team at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham defender insists he is a better midfielder&amp;nbsp;– and so does Everton boss|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fulham-defender-insists-better-midfielder-10690104|publisher=Get West London|author=Paul Warburton|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since continued to play at that position as well. Richards earned £60 a week while on a scholarship with the ''Swans''.&lt;ref name="Fivethings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham's Jazz Richards: Five things you never knew about the Wales international|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fulhams-jazz-richards-five-things-11119035|publisher=Get West London|author=Paul Warburton|date=31 March 2016|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending two seasons with the academy and reserve sides,&lt;ref name="Richards Swansea City"/&gt; Richards made his professional debut for Swansea in a [[EFL Championship|Championship]] match against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] during a 3–0 loss on 15 August 2009, replacing [[Shaun MacDonald]] as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the 63rd minute.&lt;ref name="Swansea 0 - 3 Middlesbrough"&gt;{{cite news

The start of the 2010–11 season saw Richards spend the opening six months as an unused substitute or in the reserve side. He did not make his first appearance of the season until 3 January 2011, during a 2–1 defeat against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] following a defensive injury crisis where several first team players were ruled out.&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City 2&amp;nbsp;– 1 Swansea City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9331323.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eidur Gudjohnsen top of Swansea City wish list|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/eidur-gudjohnsen-top-swans-wish-1855713|publisher=Wales Online|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout January and February, Richards was given a handful of first team opportunities. However, he lost his first team place for the remainder of the season following the return of [[Àngel Rangel]] from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangel warns Swans not to take wounded Rovers lightly|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangel-warns-swans-not-take-1853590|publisher=Wales Online|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made eight appearances during the 2010–11 season as Swansea went on to become the first Welsh team ever to gain promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name="Soccerway"&gt;{{Soccerway|75818|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13839037 |title=When Swansea City flew in top flight |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Peter Shuttleworth |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing on the bench for several matches at the start of the following season, Richards made his Premier League debut when he came on as a substitute for [[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]] during a 3–1 loss to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 15 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norwich City 3 – 1 Swansea City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/15226113.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 October 2011|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later, he was rewarded with a new 18-month contract.&lt;ref name="New Contract"&gt;{{cite web | title = Jazz Richards rewarded with new Swansea City contract | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15467773.stm | publisher = BBC Sport | date=27 October 2011 |accessdate =27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his first start for the club in the Premier League, playing in a 4–2 loss against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blackburn Rovers 4&amp;nbsp;– 2 Swansea City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/15901858.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2011–12 season progressed, Richards was sent to play in the reserves for the rest of the season, in order to regain his fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jazz-richards-future-liberty-says-2513998 |title=Jazz Richards has future at Liberty, says Michael Laudrup |publisher=WalesOnline |date=29 March 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with eight appearances.&lt;ref name="Soccerway"/&gt;

====Loan to Crystal Palace in 2013====
At the start of the 2012–13 season, Richards struggled to break into the first team over Rangel in the right-back position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-full-back-jazz-richards-5890028 |title=Swansea City full-back Jazz Richards joins Huddersfield on loan |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Jon Doel |date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, he stated his desire to leave the club on loan to gain experience and compete for his spot in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://amp.sportsmole.co.uk/football/swansea-city/news/richards-hopes-to-impress-laudrup_92450.html |title=Jazz Richards hopes to impress Michael Laudrup |publisher=Sports Mole |author=Sian Cowper |date=7 July 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was forced to wait until the winter transfer window to secure a move. In the first half of the season, he made just four appearances for Swansea, all in cup competitions. At the end of January, he joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21202706|title=Crystal Palace sign Swansea's Ashley Richards on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club five days later, on 30 January 2013 in a 1–0 loss against Huddersfield Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hudderfield Town 0&amp;nbsp;– 1 Crystal Palace|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21156106|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his next match, against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], Richards assisted [[Glenn Murray]]'s winning goal, as Palace defeated their [[South London derby|South London rivals]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glenn Murray scored late double as Crystal Palace beat Charlton 2–1|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/262499/report|publisher=Sky Sports|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his loan spell, he signed a new contract with Swansea until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21964725|title=Jazz Richards signs new three-year Swansea City contract|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make 11 appearances and appeared as an unused substitute in the [[2013 Football League Championship play-off Final|2013 Championship play-off final]], as Palace beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] 1–0 to achieve promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref name="Soccerway"/&gt;

In the 2014–15 season, Richards made his first appearance of the season in the first round of the League Cup, in a 1–0 win over [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 26 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City 1&amp;nbsp;– 0 Rotherham United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28847204|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his first Premier League appearance in two years when he came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute of a 0–0 draw against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 27 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland 0&amp;nbsp;– 0 Swansea City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289979|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Richards was given a handful of first team appearances throughout 2014 despite struggling to compete with Rangel and suffering his own injury concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stoke City vs Swansea City: Everything you need to know about Sunday's Premier League clash|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-city-vs-swansea-city-7954784|publisher=WalesOnline|author=Chris Wathan|date=17 October 2014|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-full-back-jazz-richards-9426554 |title=Swansea City full-back Jazz Richards set for Fulham move after £500,000 fee agreed |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Chris Wathan |date=10 June 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2–1 loss against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 14 December 2014, Richards made an error that led to [[Christian Eriksen]] scoring the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City 1&amp;nbsp;– 2 Tottenham Hotspur|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30366054|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 December 2014|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, he issued an apology to Swansea City supporters for his error.&lt;ref name="abuse"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-citys-jazz-richards-took-8333303 |title=Swansea City's Jazz Richards: I took Twitter flak from Swans fans for Tottenham Hotspur mistake |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Simon Gaskell |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his apology, he became a victim of abuse on social media website Twitter by Swansea City supporters.&lt;ref name="abuse"/&gt; Manager [[Garry Monk]] backed Richards and picked him in the club's following fixture against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref name="abuse"/&gt; 

This turned out to be Richards' last season with Swansea. In six years, he made just 51 appearances for the club and never established himself as a regular. Only 18 of his appearances coming in the Premier League. His lone match in the 2013–14 Europa League qualifiers was his only appearance in a European competition for the club.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt;

===Fulham===
On 24 January 2015, Richards joined Championship side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a one-month loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Jazz joins Fulham on loan |url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/jazz-joins-fulham-on-loan-2222919.aspx |publisher=Swansea City A.F.C. |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 31 January 2015, starting in a 2–1 loss against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sky Bet Championship: Blackburn Rovers battle to 2–1 victory over Fulham at Ewood Park|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/blackburn-vs-fulham/report/314092|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 February 2015|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making five appearances, Richards had his loan spell with Fulham extended until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jazz extends Fulham loan for remainder of season |url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/jazz-extends-fulham-loan-for-remainder-of-season-2296118.aspx |publisher=Swansea City A.F.C |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards went on to make 14 appearances for the Cottagers, all of which were starts.&lt;ref name="Soccerway"/&gt;

On 2 July 2015, Swansea accepted Fulham's bid for Richards to transfer on a permanent deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham transfer news: Swansea accept bid for Jazz Richards |url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/fulham-transfer-news-swansea-accept-9425260|publisher=Get West London|author=Matt Lewis|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a three-year deal with the option of a fourth, for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz Joins Fulham |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/july/02/jazz-joins-fulham |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=2 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702195809/http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/july/02/jazz-joins-fulham |archivedate= 2 July 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his year was marked with injuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/september/24/team-news |title=Team News |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=24 September 2015 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925122917/http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/september/24/team-news |archivedate=25 September 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/october/29/team-news |title=Team News |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030095746/http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2015/october/29/team-news |archivedate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards' made 22 appearances in his only season as a permanent player at the club. He established himself as a regular when he was fit. However, ahead of the 2016–17 season, Richards was expected to lose his first team place at Fulham, with manager [[Slaviša Jokanović]] preferring [[Ryan Fredericks]] in the right-back position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham boss insists there is a future for Wales international and ex-Swansea Jazz Richards&amp;nbsp;– but it's not where you think|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fulham-boss-insists-future-wales-10971823|publisher=Get West London|author=Paul Warburton|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Fulham accepted a bid from Cardiff City for Richards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Swansea City defender Jazz Richards could become first Welsh signing of Paul Trollope's Cardiff City tenure|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ex-swansea-city-defender-jazz-11607313|publisher=WalesOnline|author=Phil Smith|date=13 July 2016|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 19 July 2016, Richards joined Championship club Cardiff City on a three-year-deal in a swap move which saw [[Scott Malone]] join Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff sign Wales defender Jazz Richards as Scott Malone moves to Fulham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36780146|accessdate=19 July 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a goalless draw at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], where he became embroiled in controversy after reportedly refusing to do Cardiff's traditional [[ayatollah]] gesture, performed by fans of the club, several times at the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Cardiff City fans booed former Swansea City star Jazz Richards&amp;nbsp;– the full inside story of what happened |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/cardiff-city-fans-booed-former-11715863 |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Paul Abbandonato |date=7 August 2016 |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club later released video footage that showed him performing the gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-star-jazz-richards-11728968 |title=Cardiff City star Jazz Richards insists he DID do the Ayatollah as boss Paul Trollope holds talks with former Swansea City defender |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Chris Wathan |date=10 August 2016 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starting the season as a regular in the first team, Richards suffered a training injury in September that led to him missing three months of the season. His lengthy rehabilitation prompted manager [[Neil Warnock]] to quip "I've had lads with broken legs recover quicker than him." He eventually made his return on 2 January, as unused substitute against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff boss Warnock disappointed at speed of Richards return |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38410649 |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Michael Pearlman |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 1–0 Aston Villa |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38433120 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2017 |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed an extended run in the first team soon after, playing in ten of the club's following twelve matches, stating that he felt that he had "a lot more to show.

At the start of the following season, Richards again suffered an injury blow early in the season, being forced to undergo surgery after hurting his ankle during 2–1 victory over Sunderland on 23 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41408903 |title=Jazz Richards ankle injury blow for Wales and Cardiff City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned from injury in January 2018, playing in five matches before his season was ended by a further injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidewalessport.co.uk/cardiff-city-short-right-back/ |title=Are Cardiff City leaving themselves short in the right-back position?
