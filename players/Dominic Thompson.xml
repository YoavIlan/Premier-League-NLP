'''Dominic "Dom" Thompson''' is a fictional character on the [[New Zealand]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Shortland Street]]'' who was portrayed by [[Shane Cortese]] from 2003 to 2004.

Dom arrived as the brother of established character [[Toni Thompson]] (Laura Hill) however soon after arrival, was revealed as the half brother of [[Chris Warner]] ([[Michael Galvin]]). Initially appearing as a protagonist, Dom soon developed into a much more sinister character who was key to several high-profile storylines. These included his marriage to [[Emily Bredican]] (Sarah Somerville), affair with 16-year-old [[Delphi Greenlaw]] ([[Anna Hutchison]]), a rivalry with Chris Warner after discovering they were not related, murdering [[Geoff Greenlaw]] ([[Andrew Laing]]), his controversial return on the shows 3000th episode, his murder of Avril Lucich (Kate Louise-Elliott) and a dramatic conclusion episode in December 2004 that saw Dom die after trying to murder Chris.

Dom's two-year-long stint saw the show receive huge ratings and the period be remembered as a well done and iconic season. The character remains mentioned and referred to as a menacing and monumental character who brought the show back its excitement.

==Creation and casting==
After auditioning for Geoff Greenlaw and losing out to [[Andrew Laing]], [[Shane Cortese]] learned producers had created a character specifically for him to be the brother of a major character and it was undecided whether the character would be "good or bad".&lt;ref name=badguy&gt;{{cite web|work=NZonscreen |title=Shane Cortese on being a badguy |date=March 2011|publisher=[[NZ On Air]]|author=Coleman, James|url=http://screentalk.nzonscreen.com/interviews/shane-cortese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese made his debut as Dom in early 2003 under a yearlong contract with the potential of another 12 month expansion.&lt;ref name=badguy/&gt; The character stayed on screen for a year and departed in early 2004. Producers offered Cortese the chance to return on the show's 3000th episode under a contract that would see him continue with the show until mid-2005.&lt;ref name=scumbag&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing Shortland Street's scumbag isn't all good fun|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3580666|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=July 2004|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Barry, Rebecca|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese accepted and returned to the show on the momentous 3000th episode.&lt;ref name=jawdrop&gt;{{cite news|title=What a nasty surprise for amorous Dr Warner|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3574399|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Grant, Frances|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=24 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character ended up getting killed off later in the year.&lt;ref name=aisles&gt;{{cite news|title=Return to the shaky aisles on Shortland Street|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=9003160|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=December 2004|accessdate=1 November 2011|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|author=Barry, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Dom arrived to visit his sister [[Toni Warner|Toni]] (Laura Hill) and quickly got a job at the hospital. He mysteriously got on well with rival [[Chris Warner|Chris]]' ([[Michael Galvin]]) mother - [[Margot Warner]] (Dinah Priestley) and when she died, Dom revealed himself as Chris' illegitimate half brother. Taking up the Warner surname, Dom married [[Emily Bredican|Emily]] (Sarah Somerville) and fought attractions to teenager - [[Delphi Greenlaw]] ([[Anna Hutchison]]). Following a blood test, Dom realized he was not related to Chris but kept it a secret whilst he started an affair with Delphi. To hide the affair, he drugged his wife and soon became a suspect in the murder of [[Geoff Greenlaw|Geoff]] ([[Andrew Laing]]) who had discovered the affair. Once Chris discovered the truth, Dom circulated rumours he was a child molestor. Dom and Delphi planned to run away but Delphi discovered Dom had killed Geoff and a desperate Dom fled Ferndale.

Dom returned later in 2004, having started a relationship with [[Lucy Swinton|Lucy]] (Sally Stockwell). He managed to successfully avoid capture in relation to Geoff's murder and when [[Avril Lucich|Avril]] (Kate Louise-Elliot) began snooping, he drowned her in his bath tub. When the staff started to turn against Dom after Avril's sister [[Bernadette Lucich|Bernadette]] (Kate Louise-Elliot) accused him of murder, he faked mental illness and after escaping a psych ward, he lured Chris to a barn and tried to set him on fire. Unsuccessful, Dom ended up getting caught in a large explosion. With intense burns, Dom finally admitted to killing Geoff and Avril before he died in Toni's arms.

==Character development==

===Relationship with Delphi Greenlaw===
In 2003 Dom underwent a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old [[Delphi Greenlaw]]. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful."&lt;ref name=suds&gt;{{cite news|title=More suds in the soap|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3451964|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=May 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Grant, Frances|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects him in a way no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him."&lt;ref name=suds/&gt; Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi."&lt;ref name=aisles/&gt; The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss.&lt;ref name=powerpoint&gt;{{cite news|title=Powerpoint: Back on the home front|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3351598|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines.&lt;ref name=echoes&gt;{{cite news|title=Soapland echoes to sounds of wailing|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3533134|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=November 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Dixon, Greg|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigbangswhimpers&gt;{{cite news|title=Big bangs, and a few whimpers on telly in 2003|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3540918|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=December 2003|accessdate=1 November 2011|author=Rae, Fiona|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whodunnit&gt;{{cite web|title=Who killed Geoff Greenlaw? |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/429383?format=html |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |year=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014094717/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/429383?format=html |archivedate=14 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done everything he can for Delphi&amp;nbsp;— that's his main reason for coming back."&lt;ref name=scumbag/&gt; Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.

==Reception==
[[Michael Galvin]] listed the storyline between [[Chris Warner|Chris]] and Dom as one of the most iconic storylines on the soap.&lt;ref name=casebook&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr Warner's case book|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/television/news/article.cfm?c_id=339&amp;objectid=10513003|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=30 May 2008|author=Hunkin, Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed his physical similarity with Cortese made the storyline more believable and captivating.&lt;ref name=looksback&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Galvin looks back on his favourite memories from Shortland Street|url=https://www.nowtolove.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-news/michael-galvin-looks-back-on-his-favourite-memories-from-shortland-street-32532|work=Now to Love|date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Barry Hill of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' noted the character of Dom as a highlight of the show.&lt;ref name=dramaqueen&gt;{{cite news|title=Shortland Street's drama queen|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10384567|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=1 June 2006|author=Barry Hill, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline that saw Dom have an affair with 16-year-old [[Delphi Greenlaw|Delphi]] was viewed on as scandalous.&lt;ref name=manbehindom&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the man behind Evil Dom |work=[[Shortland Street]] |date=December 2004 |publisher=[[Television New Zealand]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AlMhJ62U?url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/459806 |archivedate=18 September 2012 |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_minisite_story_skin/459806 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His return on the 3000th episode was described as "jaw dropping".&lt;ref name=jawdrop/&gt; The "Who Killed Geoff Greenlaw" storyline is remembered as hugely iconic.&lt;ref name=whodunnit/&gt; The characters stint proved to be a ratings success and the episodes which saw Dom return, be kidnapped by [[Bernadette Lucich|Bernadette]] and his death, proved to be the shows highest rating episodes for the year.&lt;ref name=aisles/&gt; Cortese himself however, believed he was "awful" in the role of Dom but enjoyed it nonetheless.&lt;ref name=hewitson&gt;{{cite news|title=Michele Hewitson interview: Shane Cortese|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/personalities/news/article.cfm?c_id=72&amp;objectid=10757440|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=8 October 2011|author=Hewitson, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years.&lt;ref name=20magazine&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shorty Superstars|journal=Shortland Street 20th anniversary magazine|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media|New Zealand Magazines]]|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline between Chris and Dom has been voted by fans as one of the most iconic moments on the show.&lt;ref name=votemoments&gt;{{cite web|title=Shorty: vote for your favourite moments|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/blogs/on-the-box/6814211/Shorty-vote-for-your-favourite-moments|work=[[stuff.co.nz]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=27 March 2012|author=Philpot, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;
