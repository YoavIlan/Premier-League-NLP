'''Aaron William Cresswell''' (born 15 December 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (football)#Full back|left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Cresswell made his first-team debut for [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 2008 and made 70 league appearances for the club before signing for Ipswich in 2011, following a tribunal to agree the value of the transfer. He made 138 appearances for Ipswich scoring six goals, before joining West Ham United in July 2014. He made his international debut for England in November 2016 in a friendly against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].

==Club career==
===Tranmere Rovers===
Born in [[Liverpool]], Merseyside, Cresswell started his career with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]' youth system before signing his first professional contract in July 2008.&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2008 in a [[EFL League One|League One]] match with [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] which ended in a 1–0 loss.&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt;

Although he was offered a new contract by the club at the end of the 2010–11 season,&lt;ref name="Rovers Offer Six New Contracts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rovers Offer Six New Contracts |url=http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10365~2356474,00.html|publisher=Tranmere Rovers F.C |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=10 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513095616/http://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10365~2356474%2C00.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tranmere manager Les Parry expected Cresswell to turn down the contract offer saying "Aaron has got four or five [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs trying to sign him; if I had to guess I would say Aaron might be leaving us this summer."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Ipswich Town===
[[File:Aaron Cresswell.jpg|thumb|upright|Cresswell playing for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2011]]

In June 2011, the media reported that [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had won the race to sign the player beating the likes of West Brom and Doncaster Rovers for his signature, although the clubs had failed to agree a fee and resolution of this was expected to go to a transfer tribunal.&lt;ref name="Cresswell set for Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = Town win race for Cresswell| url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18673| publisher = TWTD.co.uk| date = 30 June 2011| accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-year contract was later announced to have been signed.&lt;ref name="Ipswich Town sign Tranmere defender Aaron Cresswell"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich Town sign Tranmere defender Aaron Cresswell| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13989734.stm?| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 1 July 2011| accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2012, fine performances for Ipswich Town, where he won Supporters Player Of The Year Award, led the player to be linked with [[Premier League]] clubs such as Aston Villa.&lt;ref name="Villa line up young Ipswich full-back Cresswell"&gt;{{cite news| title = Villa line up young Ipswich full-back Cresswell| url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-target-aaron-cresswell-1163547| newspaper = Daily Mirror| location = London| date = 24 July 2012| accessdate = 26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
[[File:Aaron Cresswell Signing Autographs at the Boleyn Ground, Upton Park 25Oct14.jpg|thumb|upright|Cresswell in 2014]]

On 3 July 2014, Cresswell joined West Ham United on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £3.75 million, plus add on clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11685/9383317/transfer-news-west-ham-boss-sam-allardyce-delighted-with-aaron-cresswell-deal|title=Transfer news: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce delighted with Aaron Cresswell deal|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140703/hammers-snap-up-cresswell_2236884_3947722? |title=Hammers snap up Cresswell |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=3 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707031807/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140703/hammers-snap-up-cresswell_2236884_3947722 |archivedate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his West Ham debut on 16 August 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Rose |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28718387 |title=West Ham United 0–1 Tottenham Hotspur |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November he scored his first goal for the club, in the 1–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |title=West Ham United 1–0 Newcastle United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30156773 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Cresswell was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]] and Player's Player of the Year.&lt;ref name=HotY&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/May/6-May/Aaron-completes-Player-Awards-hat-trick! |title=Aaron completes Player Awards hat-trick! |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=6 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510024444/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/May/6-May/Aaron-completes-Player-Awards-hat-trick%21 |archivedate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell played all 38 league matches and all four FA Cup matches for West Ham in [[2014–15 West Ham United F.C. season|2014–15]].&lt;ref name=sb1415/&gt; In June 2015, Cresswell signed a new contract which would keep him with West Ham until 2020, with the option for a further two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33321175 |title=Aaron Cresswell: West Ham defender signs five-year contract |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresswell made the highest number of appearances of any West Ham player in [[2015–16 West Ham United F.C. season|2015–16]], playing in 47 matches. He featured in 37 of the possible 38 Premier League matches scoring two goals, away to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 26 December, and at eventual champions [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in a 2–2 draw on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=2016&amp;united=Premier_League_2015-16 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Premier League 2015–16 | publisher=West Ham Stats | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Cresswell was injured in a 3–0 pre-season victory over [[Karlsruher SC]]. Suffering a knee-ligament injury, Cresswell was initially expected to be out of action for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36883514 | title=Aaron Cresswell: West Ham defender out for four months with knee injury | publisher=BBC Sport | date=25 July 2016 | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresswell recovered in time to make his return in West Ham's 1–0 victory away at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 15 October, assisting [[Manuel Lanzini]] for the winning goal, however his comeback was cut short after he was sent-off for two yellow cards within a minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37594218 |title=Crystal Palace 0–1 West Ham United |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 7 November 2016, Cresswell received his first international call-up to the [[England national football team|England]] squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] with Scotland and a friendly with [[Spain national football team|Spain]], following [[Danny Drinkwater]]'s withdrawal from the squad due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England call up Aaron Cresswell and Jordan Pickford for Scotland qualifier|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/07/england-aaron-cresswell-jordan-pickford-scotland|accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 15 November, replacing [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]] in a 2–2 draw with Spain at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 2–2 Spain |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37896472 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
