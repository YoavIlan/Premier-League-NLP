After having his spot kick saved, he scored from the rebound with his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36993966 |title=Newcastle United 1–2 Huddersfield Town |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gayle would score in the next two matches for Newcastle, with a brace in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37030439 |title=Newcastle United 4–1 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only goal of the game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37067397 |title=Bristol City 0–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until over a month later when he found the net again, scoring a hat-trick against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], coming back from 3–1 down to win 4–3 in stoppage time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37426290 |title=Newcastle United 4–3 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During October, Gayle scored braces in consecutive victories against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37593786 |title=Newcastle United 3–1 Brentford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37615018 |title=Barnsley 0–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 20 November, Gayle scored another brace, this time against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37965461 |title=Leeds United 0–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December, Gayle scored a hat-trick against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38193496 |title=Newcastle United 4–0 Birmingham City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later score in matches against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], ending 2016 as the league's top scorer with 19 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38271711 |title=Burton Albion 1–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38412240 |title=Newcastle United 3–1 Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 December 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 win over Brentford, and in doing so, became the first Newcastle player since [[Alan Shearer]] to score 20 league goals in a season. A few minutes later however, he sustained a hamstring injury, and had to be substituted off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38551590 |title=Brentford 1–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injury kept him out for the next four matches; he would make his return against Norwich City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38889065 |title=Norwich City 2–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started the match against Aston Villa, but once again, had to leave the pitch early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38952759 |title=Newcastle United 2–0 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would become a recurring problem for Gayle, and on three occasions from February to April, he had to be substituted off in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39111416 |title=Reading 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39239330 |title=Birmingham 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39464957 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, his goal tally also suffered, as he scored twice during this period, netting against Huddersfield Town and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39086346 |title=Huddersfield Town 1–3 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39389117 |title=Newcastle United 2–1 Wigan Athletic |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gayle was absent for the rest of April, and made his return on the final day of the season, scoring in a 3–0 win over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], as Newcastle edged out [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] by a point to win the [[2016–17 EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39760419 |title=Newcastle United 3–0 Barnsley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2017 |accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2017, Gayle scored the opening goal in an eventual 4–1 loss to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. His goal was the first that the ''Red Devils'' had conceded from open play since 31 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41951920 |title=Manchester United 4–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 November 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, Gayle again scored the opening goal, this time, in a 3–1 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42119935 |title=Chelsea 4–1 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2017 |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December, Gayle was involved in both Newcastle goals in a 3–2 loss to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], assisting [[Joselu]] for the first and then scoring the equaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42205603 |title=Newcastle United 2–3 Leicester City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 December 2017 |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the season, Gayle remained a first team regular, but only scored three more goals for Newcastle – a brace against [[AFC Bournemouth]] in a 2–2 draw on 24 February 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43094246 |title=Bournemouth 2–2 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a goal against Chelsea in a 3–0 win, the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44020154 |title=Newcastle United 3–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Bromwich Albion (loan)====
On 6 August 2018, Gayle joined newly relegated Championship club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a season-long loan deal from Newcastle. The deal included [[Salomón Rondón]] going the other way for the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2018/august/gayle-arrives-at-the-hawthorns/ |title=Gayle arrives at The Hawthorns |publisher=West Bromwich Albion F.C. |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August, Gayle drew a foul from his former Newcastle teammate [[Tim Krul]], now of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], with the resulting penalty scored by [[Jay Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45066581 |title=Norwich City 3–4 West Bromwich Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 August, Gayle scored his first goal for the club, the fourth goal in a emphatic 7–1 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. He was also the fouled player for both of Rodriguez's penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45152565 |title=West Bromwich Albion 7–1 Queens Park Rangers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During September, Gayle scored four times in three consecutive home match wins over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45304577 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–1 Stoke City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45479782 |title=West Bromwich Albion 4–2 Bristol City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45529540 |title=West Bromwich Albion 2–0 Millwall |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September, he scored the third goal, a free-kick, in a 3–2 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45609719 |title=Preston 2–3 West Bromwich Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 September 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances, he was awarded with the Championship Player of the Month by the [[English Football League|EFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.efl.com/news/2018/october/player-of-the-month-dwight-gayle/ |title=Player of the Month: Dwight Gayle |publisher=EFL.com |date=5 October 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October, Gayle scored a brace in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45688429 |title=West Bromwich Albion 4–1 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2019, Gayle was suspended for two matches after accepting a charge of "successful deception of a match official", following an incident in the match against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] earlier that week when he "won" a late penalty enabling his team to take a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dwight Gayle: West Brom striker banned for 'diving' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47245351 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 February 2019 |date=14 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
He is described as an "energetic, hardworking, pacey striker" and a "natural finisher".&lt;ref name=posh/&gt;

==Personal life==
Gayle is of Jamaican descent through his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/dwightgayle/status/286791066059939841 |title=@209fifashirts Jamaica and England |first=Dwight |last=Gayle |date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dwight-gayle-not-focused-international-12231210 |title=Dwight Gayle not focused on international football but reveals he can play for Jamaica |first=Lee |last=Ryder |date=26 November 2016 |newspaper=The Chronicle |location=Newcastle |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
