'''Leighton John Baines''' (born 11 December 1984) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for {{English football updater|Everton}} club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], where he is also vice-captain, and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Baines started his career with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], and was part of the team that won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the [[2002–03 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2002–03 season]] and was a runner-up in the [[2004–05 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2004–05]] [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and the [[2006 Football League Cup Final|2006 League Cup Final]].

==Club career==
===Wigan Athletic===
Baines made his debut for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2002, and was a member of the team that won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in the [[2002–03 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2002–03 season]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He was a regular in the first team when Wigan earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] in [[2004–05 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2004–05]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} That season saw Baines score his first goal for the club, a long-range shot against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

When he secured promotion with Wigan, he doubted he was good enough to play in the Premier League: "We won promotion to the Premier League and, straight away, I was thinking, 'Where am I going to go now?' I should have been celebrating but I spent a large part of that summer worrying about what it would be like spending the next year on the bench and in the reserves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|title=Baines thriving after test of his fragile nerve|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/29/newsstory.everton|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines signed a new contract with Wigan in February 2005 despite being linked to a number of Premier League clubs, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines commits to Latics |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=254724&amp;plid=12745&amp;clid=111&amp;cpid=10 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=23 September 2006 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended his contract again after impressive displays in his first season in the Premier League.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Whilst at Wigan he started in the [[2006 Football League Cup Final|2006 League Cup Final]] defeat to Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/4727118.stm|title=Man Utd ease to Carling Cup glory|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
[[File:Leighton Baines throw-in.jpg|thumb|upright|Baines playing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009]]

In July 2007, Baines rejected a move to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], after their bid of a reported £6&amp;nbsp;million was accepted by Wigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines rejects Sunderland switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6288856.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 July 2007 | date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month he signed for Everton for an initial fee of £5&amp;nbsp;million, with another £1&amp;nbsp;million in add-ons, dependent on Baines's appearances for Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baines joins Everton |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_2643417,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6934188.stm |title=Everton capture Baines from Wigan |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines did not play regularly in his first season, making just 29 appearances in all competitions, due to an injury and the good form of [[Phil Jagielka]] and [[Joseph Yobo]] at centre back which kept [[Joleon Lescott]] at left back.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} His second season at Everton saw an increase in Baines's playing time.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Due to an injury to Yobo, Lescott moved to the centre of defence and Baines played at left back.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He was voted Player of the Month at Everton two months in a row in the 2008–09 season.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Baines scored his first ever Everton goal against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 21 March, at [[Fratton Park]], after 57 matches (in all competitions) without scoring.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 30 August 2009, he scored a last minute [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in a 2–1 win over his former team Wigan.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A month later, he [[captain (association football)|captained]] Everton for the first time in a [[UEFA Europa League]] match against [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000037/match=2000779/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221032540/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season%3D2010/round%3D2000037/match%3D2000779/index.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=21 February 2010 |title=Everton revived on Europa League stage |publisher=UEFA |date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2010–11 Everton F.C. season|2010–11 season]], Baines played every minute of Everton's Premier League matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/26/premier-league-opta-statistics|title=Number-crunching makes grim reading for Arsenal's defence|first=Paul|last=Doyle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as scoring seven goals in all competitions. His contribution was rewarded with the club's Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season, and Goal of the Season awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/player-of-season|title=Baines' Glorious Treble|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], scored from direct free kick, was voted Everton Goal of the Season.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He also contributed 11 assists throughout the season, 5th overall in the league, and was the league's highest assisting defender.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Leighton Baines 2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baines playing for Everton in 2011]]

Baines scored five times during [[2011–12 Everton F.C. season|2011–12]], four of which were penalties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He reached 99 consecutive league matches before ending his season early due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/19/everton-leighton-baines-euro-2012 | title=Everton's Leighton Baines hamstrung but should be fit for Euro 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian | date=19 April 2012 | accessdate=23 April 2012 | author=Hunter, Andy | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance at left back was deemed impressive enough to be named in the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]]'s Premier League Team of the Year in 2012, the first Everton player to do so for 22 years since [[Neville Southall]] in 1989–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/22/robin-van-persie-pfa-player-of-year | title=Arsenal's Robin van Persie is honoured to win PFA player of year award |newspaper=The Guardian | date=23 April 2012 | accessdate=23 April 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2012–13 Everton F.C. season|2012–13 season]], Baines created 116 chances for his teammates,&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/everton/id/925?&amp;cc=5739 | title=Chelsea defeat epitomises the season for Everton | publisher=ESPN FC | accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2305726/Leighton-Baines-David-Silva-Luis-Suarez-create-chances-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Lionel-Messi.html | title=Forget Messi and Ronaldo, it's Premier League defender Baines who creates more chances than anyone in Europe | newspaper=Daily Mail | accessdate=19 May 2013 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Cass | date=8 April 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When 2013's PFA Premier League Team of the Year was announced, Baines was again included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/28/tottenham-gareth-bale-pfa-player-of-year | title=Tottenham's Gareth Bale wins PFA player of year award for second time | newspaper=The Guardian | date=29 April 2013 | accessdate=30 April 2013 | author=Riach, James | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also won Everton's [[List of Everton F.C. records and statistics#Evertonfc.com player awards|Player of the Season]] and Players' Player of the Season awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/baines-named-player-of-the-season | title=Baines Named Player of the Season | publisher=Everton F.C. | accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baines was the only outfield player to have played in every minute of every Premier League match during the season.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; He was the subject of multiple bids during the 2013 summer transfer window from Manchester United but all were rejected by Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/10286980/Everton-keen-to-reward-Leighton-Baines-with-new-deal.html | title=Everton keen to reward Leighton Baines with new deal | newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate=5 September 2013 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Bascombe | date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines scored two free-kicks either side of goalkeeper [[Jussi Jääskeläinen]] from the same position as Everton beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 3–2 in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2426891/West-Ham-2-Everton-3--match-report-Leighton-Baines-scores-free-kicks.html | title=West Ham 2 Everton 3: Lukaku on debut and two stunners from Baines see off Hammers in thriller | newspaper=Daily Mail | accessdate=21 September 2013 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Ryan | date=21 September 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was only the fifth player since 2006–07 to score two direct free-kicks in one Premier League match (after Rooney, Ronaldo, Drogba and Larsson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The FourFourTwo Preview: Everton vs Newcastle|magazine=FourFourTwo |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/fourfourtwo-preview-everton-vs-newcastle|accessdate=14 November 2013|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baines suffered a toe injury in November which saw him miss a top flight fixture for the first time in 52 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gerard-deulofeu-needs-keep-playing-6362420 | title=Deulofeu needs to keep playing with a smile&amp;nbsp;– Martinez | newspaper=Liverpool Echo | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January 2014, Baines signed a four-year deal to extend his contract at Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25910996 |title = Leighton Baines: Everton defender signs new deal with club| publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 27 January 2014 | date = 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored three penalties during the season to take his career tally to 13, becoming the first player in Premier League history to have taken more than 10 and never missed one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/02/leighton-baines-penalties-record_n_4531248.html | title=Everton's Leighton Baines Scores Record 11th Premier League Penalty |newspaper=HuffPost |location=New York | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th came on his 300th appearance in the competition in a 2–0 win over Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skysports.com/opinion/story/0,25212,12038_9277213,00.html | title=Champs minus blanks | publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baines scored five goals and assisted four others during [[2013–14 Everton F.C. season|2013–14]], the most of any defender in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/matchweek-37-post-match-stats.html | title=MW37 stats: Liverpool set away goals mark | publisher=Premier League | accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
