'''Tobias Albertine Maurits Alderweireld''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈtoːbi ˈɑldərβ̞ɛːrəlt}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnN8KhaL3eM|title=Toby: It's All In a Name!|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Football Club (Spurs TV) |website=youtube.com |date=8 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 2 March 1989) is a Belgian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. Mainly a [[central defender]], he can also play as a [[right back (association football)|right back]].

Alderweireld began his professional career at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], where he won honours including three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles. In 2013, he moved to [[Atlético Madrid]], where he won [[La Liga]] and reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] final in his first season.

A full international since 2009, Alderweireld has earned over 80 caps for Belgium and represented the country at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Born in [[Antwerp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title =Toby Alderweireld profile  | url=http://www.vi.nl/Spelers/Speler.htm?dbid=59198&amp;typeofpage=84137 |publisher=VI.nl| date = 18 January 2009 |accessdate= 19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alderweireld moved to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]'s [[AFC Ajax Youth Academy|youth academy]] in August 2004 from [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]]. On 22 February 2007, he signed his first professional contract, tying him to the club until 30 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ajax sign Toby Alderweireld|url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=61844|publisher=AFC Ajax|date=22 February 2007|accessdate=19 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023213133/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154814/contentid%3D61844|archivedate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the first team for the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]], but only made his first team debut on 18 January, in the 4–2 victory over [[N.E.C.

[[File:TobyAlderweireld.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Alderweireld with Ajax.]]
During the early stages of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld established himself in the first team and starting XI. He became first choice centre-back along with fellow Belgian [[Jan Vertonghen]] following the departure of former captain [[Thomas Vermaelen]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Wij hebben de beste selctie van Nederland'|last=Zwartkruis|first=Simon|work=Association football|date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Ajax coach [[Martin Jol]] praised the two defenders and kept faith in the duo after a string of good performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-en-alderweireld-dat-ziet-iedereen.aspx|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen en Alderweireld, dat ziet iedereen'|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coerts|first=Stefan |title =Ajax Coach Martin Jol Praises Jan Vertonghen And Toby Alderweireld | url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2009/09/30/1532572/ajax-coach-martin-jol-praises-jan-vertonghen-and-toby |work=Goal| date = 13 October 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 3–0 win against [[Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] on 4 September, he scored his first league goal for the club when he opened the scoring with a header from [[Luis Suárez]]'s corner-kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=271817|title=SC Heracles Almelo vs. Ajax Amsterdam - Football Match Report - August 30, 2009 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January, he scored a late equaliser in extra time during the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] [[2009–10 KNVB Cup#Quarter finals|quarter-final]] against NEC; [[Siem de Jong]] scored five minutes before the final whistle to steal a 3–2 win for Ajax. At the end of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld was named Ajax Talent of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/6550355/__Supporters_Ajax_eren_Suarez__.html |title=Supporters Ajax eren Suarez |work=De Telegraaf |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assured himself of a place in the Eredivisie giants' history books on 3 November 2011, heading in Ajax's 100th UEFA Champions League goal in the 2–1 Group G defeat by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1590396.html |title=Ajax's Alderweireld thrives on art of defending |publisher=UEFA by Berend Scholten|date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]], he scored a stunning 25-yard strike at the [[San Siro]] against [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in a 2–0 away win. He followed this spectacular goal with an even more impressive 32-yard strike against [[Feyenoord]] in a 2–0 home win.
In the [[2011–12 AFC Ajax season|2011–12 season]], Alderweireld made significant strides in his ability as a footballer, also forming a formidable partnership in the heart of the Ajax defensive with captain and fellow Belgian Jan Vertonghen. Alderweireld also showed some impressive offensive ability, scoring a remarkable goal against [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]].

On 5 August 2012, during the [[2012 Johan Cruyff Shield|Johan Cruyff Shield]] encounter against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], Alderweireld managed to score for Ajax in the 44th minute, bringing his club back within a goals difference going into halftime 2–1. Unfortunately, it was a match Ajax would lose 4–2, making it the third Johan Cruyff Shield which Alderweireld participated in and finished as runners-up. The following [[2012–13 AFC Ajax season|2012–13 season]], however, would be a successful one, marking the third year in a row that Alderweireld would play Champions League football, and also winning his third consecutive [[Eredivisie]] title for Ajax and 32nd overall, having played as a starting centre-back for Ajax in all three championship pursuits. Alderweireld scored a further three goals that season for Ajax, including two goals during the regular season against [[PEC Zwolle]] and [[FC Twente|Twente]], as well as scoring another goal in a 2–0 home victory against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], in the first leg of the Round of 32 in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#First leg|2012–13 UEFA Europa League]]. Having been drawn into a group with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and eventual runners-up [[Borussia Dortmund]] during its Champions League campaign, Ajax had entered into the Europa League at the knockout phase having secured third place in their group, but failed to advance, losing in the second leg match in Romania 4–2 on penalty kicks after extra time.

[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|Alderweireld with Ajax teammates in 2011.]]
With one more year remaining on his contract, Alderweireld opted not to extend his contract with Ajax, subsequently receiving plenty of interest during the off-season, with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] being mentioned as the most keen to sign the young defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.de/bayer-04-leverkusen/alderweireld-soll-kommen-kadlec-wechselt-zu-fenerbahce,3288,23318686.html |title=Alderweireld soll kommen Kadlec wechselt zu Fenerbahce |publisher=Express.de by Lars Werner.com|date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |title=Napoli wil tien miljoen euro betalen voor Toby Alderweireld |publisher=Nieuws.be by Voetbal4U.com |date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024075930/http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |archivedate=24 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlético Madrid===
On 2 September 2013, Alderweireld joined [[Atlético Madrid]] on a four-year contract for an estimated €7&amp;nbsp;million (£6.16&amp;nbsp;million) transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transfer deadline day: Atletico Madrid sign Toby Alderweireld and Josuha Guilavogui|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11838/8903655/transfer-deadline-day-atletico-madrid-sign-toby-alderweireld-and-josuha-guilavogui|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corrigan|first1=Dermot|title=Toby Alderweireld rejected Liverpool|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1543223/toby-alderweireld-rejected-liverpool-move-to-join-atletico-madrid|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 12 matches as the club won [[La Liga]]; on 11 May, he headed his only goal of the season, an equaliser in a 1–1 home draw with [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in the penultimate round of fixtures, ensuring that Atlético remained in the title race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlético Madrid 1–1 Málaga|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27301114|accessdate=1 September 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alderweireld played the final seven minutes and extra time of the [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|2014 Champions League final]] for Atlético in place of [[Filipe Luís]]; the team was beating [[Madrid Derby|city rival]] Real Madrid 1–0 when he entered the field of play, but Atlético eventually lost 1–4.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Madrid 4 Atlético Madrid 1|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27383593|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southampton (loan)====
Alderweireld was sent on a season-long loan to English [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 1 September 2014, with the option for Southampton to buy him at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agreement with Southampton for the loan of Alderweireld|url=http://en.clubatleticodemadrid.com/noticias/agreement-with-southampton-for-the-loan-of-alderweireld|publisher=[[Atlético Madrid]]|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton loan Toby Alderweireld from Atletico Madrid|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29025087|accessdate=2 September 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Southampton debut on 13 September, helping to keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 victory against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29090536 |title=Striker Graziano Pelle scored twice as Southampton overwhelmed a poor Newcastle side at St Mary's Stadium. |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=14 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, he scored his first goal for the club, Southampton's third in a 3–1 away win away to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] by heading [[James Ward-Prowse]]'s [[corner kick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emons|first1=Michael|title=Crystal Palace 1–3 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544147|accessdate=26 December 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton had a £6.8&amp;nbsp;million option to buy Alderweireld, but in July 2015 Atlético cancelled the clause for £1.5&amp;nbsp;million in order to sell to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tottenham agree £11.5m fee with Atletico Madrid for defender Toby Alderweireld|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3149989/Tottenham-agree-11-5m-fee-Atletico-Madrid-defender-Toby-Alderweireld.html|work=Mail online|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reports claimed that Atlético failed to exercise their buy-out in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Alan|title=Southampton ponder legal action if Toby Alderweireld joins Tottenham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/southampton-toby-alderweireld-atletico-madrid|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 8 July 2015, Alderweireld joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on a five-year contract which runs until the summer of 2020 at [[White Hart Lane]], despite Southampton threatening legal action over the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33442272 |title=Toby Alderweireld: Tottenham sign Atletico Madrid defender |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=9 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee was estimated to be £11.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toby Alderweireld signs for Tottenham for £11.5m on five-year deal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3153262/Toby-Alderweireld-signs-Tottenham-11-5m-five-year-deal.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490 |work=Daily Mail |date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Spurs, he was reunited with former Ajax teammates [[Christian Eriksen]] and Jan Vertonghen, who previously joined the north London side from Ajax.  On 30 July, Alderweireld made his club debut in the [[2015 MLS All-Star Game]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. During a 2–1 defeat, Alderweireld started the game and was replaced by [[Federico Fazio]] after 62 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borg|first1=Simon|title=MLS All-Stars 2, Tottenham Hotspur 1|url=http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2015-07-29-mls-all-star-team-vs-tottenham-hotspur/recap|publisher=MLS Soccer|accessdate=21 October 2015|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
