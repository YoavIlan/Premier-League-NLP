'''David Ospina Ramírez''' ({{IPA-es|daˈβið osˈpina raˈmiɾes}}, born 31 August 1988) is a Colombian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]  for [[Serie A]] club [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], on loan from {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and the [[Colombia national football team|Colombia national team]].

Ospina began his career at [[Atlético Nacional]], making his debut with the club in 2005. After achieving two domestic titles with ''Los Verdolagas'', Ospina joined French side [[OGC Nice|Nice]]. In 2014, he joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a four-year deal.

Ospina has been representing his country at a full international level since 2007. Upon his debut against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], he became the second-youngest goalkeeper to play for Colombia. He has since earned over 90 caps for his nation and has appeared at three [[Copa América]]s and two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].

==Club career==
[[File:David Ospina.jpg|left|thumb|Ospina with Atlético Nacional in 2008]]

===Atlético Nacional===
Ospina began his professional career in [[Categoría Primera A]] club [[Atlético Nacional]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague=england-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/240/835/0/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news |title=Arsenal seal Ospina signing |website=FIFA.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808085405/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/nationalleagues/nationalleague%3Dengland-premier-league-2000000000/news/newsid/240/835/0/index.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news |archivedate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina played a total of 97 matches with the team, even being called to the national team. With the club, Ospina achieved three league titles. In mid-2008, Ospina was transferred to French club [[OGC Nice|Nice]].&lt;ref name="Ospina to Nice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina's transfer to Nice underway|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nice===
[[File:Ospina1.JPG|thumb|right|Ospina playing for Nice]]
After three seasons at [[Atlético Nacional]], at the age of 19, he was transferred to Nice in France for an undisclosed fee, believed to be about €2&amp;nbsp;million. Ospina was reportedly signed to become the long-term replacement of [[Hugo Lloris]], who had transferred to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] for €8.5&amp;nbsp;million. However, Ospina was served as a substitute of [[Lionel Letizi]] for the first few months of his career, before breaking into the first team. [[Frédéric Antonetti]], the manager of Nice who brought Ospina to the club, said, "He has everything you need to be a top goalkeeper. He's good in the air and he's good on the ground. He has that little extra something to be a champion. Hugo Lloris was an international-standard goalkeeper; so is David."&lt;ref name="Ospina Praised by Nice boss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina will be a success|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years into his career at Nice, Ospina publicly voiced his desire to leave the club. Nice coach [[Claude Puel]] signed promising young French goalkeeper [[Joris Delle]], and announced Delle would be promoted into the first team, sharing the position with Ospina. In the summer of 2012, Turkish club [[Besiktas J.K.|Besiktas]] attempted to sign Ospina,&lt;ref name="Besiktas bid for Ospina fails"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina to Beskitas off|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/nice-call-ospina-besiktas-sale-142023974.html|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=1 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203112050/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/nice-call-ospina-besiktas-sale-142023974.html|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the move fell through.&lt;ref name="Ospina is dropped"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina filled with frustration as he is club No 2|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3912/english-premier-league/2014/07/27/4973986/david-ospina-the-man-who-replaced-hugo-lloris-meet-the-new|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ospina's performances at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and his rejection of a contract extension, he was linked to many European sides.&lt;ref name="Ospina rejects contract"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ospina could leave for free next season after rejecting extension|url=http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2014/david-ospina-set-to-walk-away-from-les-aiglons-for-free/|publisher=Obtenir le football|accessdate= 31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being heavily linked to [[Atlético Madrid]], Puel announced that Ospina would depart the club to join English side [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="Ospina will join Arsenal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Puel: Ospina to Arsenal is done|url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/nice-manager-claude-puel-confirms-david-ospina-has-joined-arsenal/|publisher=101greatgoals.com|accessdate= 27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
====2014–15 season====
On 27 July 2014, Arsenal had confirmed that Ospina had signed for the club on for an undisclosed fee, believed to be £3&amp;nbsp;million, on a four-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28508854|title=David Ospina: Arsenal sign Colombia goalkeeper from Nice|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 July 2014|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the club's official [[Instagram]] account, Arsenal revealed that Ospina would wear the number 13 shirt for the club, last worn by loanee [[Emiliano Viviano]]. On 23 September 2014, Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], a 2–1 home defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1415/post/first-team/arsenal-v-southampton-match-report |title=Arsenal v. Southampton Match Report |work=Arsenal FC |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second Arsenal appearance on 1 October in their [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] group stage match at home to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], replacing [[Alexis Sánchez]] after starting goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]] had been sent off for a [[professional foul]] on [[Burak Yılmaz]]. Ospina conceded the penalty, taken by its earner, but Arsenal won 4–1, making several vital saves in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal 4–1 Galatasaray|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29362640|accessdate=1 October 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Ospina suffered a thigh injury that would keep him out effectively for the rest of the 2014 calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/arsenal/story/2102243/arsenals-david-ospina-ruled-out-for-around-three-months-with-thigh-injury|title=Arsenal's David Ospina ruled out for around three months with thigh injury|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina resumed his cup duties in a 2–0 win against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], but maintained his place for his full [[Premier League]] debut a week later, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/551394/Arsene-Wenger-Wojciech-Szczesny-team-selection|title=Arsene Wenger: Why I picked David Ospina instead of Wojciech Szczesny|date=11 January 2015|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; With first-choice goalkeeper Szczęsny punished for smoking in the dressing room after a game against Southampton, Ospina was made first choice in the league and went on to claim successive clean sheets against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He played every remaining league game until the end of the season, with the exception of [[FA Cup]] ties against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Moreover, he was also an unused substitute in Arsenal's 4–0 win in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]] against Aston Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/32563518|title=FA Cup final – FT: Arsenal 4–0 Villa|date=30 May 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ospina's performances earned him a place on the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] longlist for the [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or#FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015 campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaworld.com/off-the-ball/ospina-reacts-ballon-or/?refresh_ce-cp|title=Arsenal's Ospina reacts to Ballon d'Or selection|website=La Gazzetta dello Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=3 October 2015|last=Sylla|first=Ogo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
[[File:David Ospina, 2015-05-31.JPG|left|thumb|Ospina after winning the [[2014–15 FA Cup|FA Cup]] with Arsenal in 2015]]
During the summer transfer window period, Ospina was linked to [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] after Arsenal had signed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] goalkeeper [[Petr Čech]], which effectively demoted Ospina to second-choice keeper. However, no deal materialised, as second-choice Wojciech Szczęsny was loaned to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33672118|title=Wojciech Szczesny: Arsenal keeper joins Roma on a season-loan deal|date=29 July 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina made his first appearance of the season in a 2–1 away defeat against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|2015–16 Champions League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34160767|title=Dinamo Zagreb 2–1 Arsenal|date=16 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the team's "cup goalkeeper", he made his first domestic appearance in a 2–1 [[2015–16 Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[London]] [[North London derby|rivals]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34265590|title=Tottenham 1–2 Arsenal|date=23 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina made another Champions League appearance, against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], where his poor performances proved costly in a 3–2 home defeat, with the keeper conceding an own goal by dropping a corner from [[Kostas Fortounis]] into his own net'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34382802|title=Arsenal 2–3 Olympiakos|date=29 September 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina would later be dropped from Champions League duties in place of Čech. Ospina suffered a shoulder injury during October's international break that saw him ruled out until November. He was then in contention to face [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in January, but a training injury saw Čech take his place.

====2016–17 season====
Ospina made his first start for Arsenal of the 2016–17 season in the club's opening game in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] Group-stage against French champions [[Paris Saint Germain]], producing a man-of-the-match performance as Arsenal drew 1–1; Ospina himself drew praise for many saves made during the game, mainly against striker [[Edinson Cavani]]. Ospina started in the FA cup final where he conceded 1 goal as Arsenal won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37331259|title=Paris St-Germain 1–1 Arsenal|date=13 September 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3787688/PSG-1-1-Arsenal-Alexis-Sanchez-rescues-Champions-League-point-Gunners.html|title=PSG 1–1 Arsenal: Alexis Sanchez rescues Champions League point|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2403638.html|title=Ospina keen to seize chance after Arsenal heroics|first=|last=UEFA.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
Ospina made his first appearance of the season in a 1–0 win over [[Doncaster Rovers]] in the [[Carabao Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249728|title=Arsenal 1–0 Doncaster|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second start in a 3–1 [[Europa League]] win against [[FC Cologne]], committing an error that led to the team going 1–0 down early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41227374|title=Arsenal 3–1 FC Cologne|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Arsenal suffered four straight defeats Ospina kept a clean sheet as the Gunners beat [[AC Milan]] 2–0 at the [[San Siro Stadium]] in the Europa League round of 16 on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43321163|title=AC Milan 0–2 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 March 2018|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoli (loan)===
Following the arrival of [[Bernd Leno]], Ospina requested go on loan in order to gain proper playing time. On August 15, Serie A team [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] agreed to a one-year loan deal with an option to buy following new signing [[Alex Meret]]'s injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/15/david-ospina-joins-napoli-on-loan-from-arsenal |title=

==International career==
[[File:FWC 2018 - Round of 16 - COL v ENG - Photo 088.jpg|right|thumb|Ospina during the Round of 16 penalty shoot-out against England]]
Ospina had his first international experience representing Colombia's [[Colombia national under-20 football team|under-20 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://es.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=9102/teams/team=44021.html |date=* |title=2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup&amp;nbsp;– Colombia squad }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina was called up for the first time in the national U-20 team for [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. At only 16 years old, Ospina was the youngest member of the squad, however he did not play any game during the whole tournament. Ospina was called back for the [[2007 South American U-20 Championship]], where he played four games. However, Colombia failed to qualify for the World Cup, the last youth tournament he had the opportunity to play in.

Ospina made his debut for the senior team as a substitute in the 1–3 defeat against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He played his first match in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], becoming the second-youngest goalkeeper to play for the Colombian national team.

Ospina was selected as the main goalkeeper for Colombia throughout the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] competition. At the end of the qualifiers, Ospina conceded the fewest number of goals of the tournament.

At the [[2014 World Cup]], Ospina appeared in all of Colombia's matches and conceded four goals throughout the tournament.

In May 2018 he was named in Colombia’s preliminary 35 man [[Colombia national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb&lt;/ref&gt; Despite saving a penalty against [[Jordan Henderson]] in the Round of 16 penalty shoot-out against [[England national football team|England]], Colombia were eliminated 3–4 on penalties.

==Personal life==
Ospina was brother-in-law to fellow Colombian international footballer [[James Rodríguez]], who married David's sister Daniela in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fabwags.com/?p=26880 |title=James Rodriguez The Soccer Star is also a Family Man |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they announced their separation in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/james-rod/1mugl77wy9d541exdz6rcd0eqt|title=James Rodriguez and wife Daniela Ospina announce separation |website=Goal.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ospina is married to Colombian model Jesica Sterling, whom he married in 2012, and has one daughter named Dulce María            &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fabwags.com/jesica-sterling-colombian-soccer-player-david-ospinas-wife/|work= Fabwags|date=9 September 2014 |title=Jesica Sterling – Colombian Soccer player David Ospina's Wife|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son named Maximiliano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/es-co/news/4604/colombianos-en-inglaterra/2015/01/26/8340492/david-ospina-es-padre-por-segunda-vez |title=David Ospina es padre por segunda vez |language=Spanish |date=26 January 2015 |website=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
