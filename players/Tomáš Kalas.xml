'''Tomáš Kalas''' (born 15 May 1993) is a Czech professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], on loan from [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He plays as a [[centre back]], but has also been played as a [[right back]].

Having begun his career at [[Sigma Olomouc]], he signed for Chelsea for a reported £5.2 million in 2010. He spent most of his tenure out on loan, first back at Sigma, then at [[Vitesse Arnhem]], [[1. FC Köln]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

Kalas earned 42 caps and scored once for the Czech youth international teams, and made his senior international debut in 2012.

==Club career==

===Chelsea===

====Early career====
Born in [[Olomouc]], Kalas started his career in his hometown with [[SK Sigma Olomouc|Sigma Olomouc]], making his debut in a 2–0 victory over [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] on 5 May 2010.&lt;ref name="Thomas Kalas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Kalas|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/thomas-kalas/129944/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then signed for [[Premier League]] champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], on 7 July 2010, for a reported figure of around £5.2&amp;nbsp;million, although it was agreed that he would stay at Sigma Olomouc for the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name="Chelsea sign teenage Czech defender Tomas Kalas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8797276.stm|title=Chelsea sign teenage Czech defender Tomas Kalas|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalas arrived at Chelsea for the second half of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] and made his Chelsea [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] debut in a 2–2 away draw to [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|Aston Villa]] on 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TheReservesNews/0,,10268~2298926,00.html | title=Reserve Report: Aston Villa 2 Chelsea 2 | accessdate=3 March 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320140716/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TheReservesNews/0,,10268~2298926,00.html | archivedate=20 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2011 Kalas joined Dutch football club [[Vitesse Arnhem]] on [[Loan (association football)|loan]] for the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vitesse.nl/nieuws/bericht/presentatie-nieuwe-nummer-2-tomas-kalas/1784 | title=Presentatie nieuwe nummer 2: Tomáš Kalas | accessdate=22 August 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104155705/http://www.vitesse.nl/nieuws/bericht/presentatie-nieuwe-nummer-2-tomas-kalas/1784 | archivedate=4 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the number 2 jersey. He made his debut for Vitesse on 17 September 2011 against [[Roda JC Kerkrade]] which ended in a 5–0 win for Vitesse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2011/9/22/2442698/chelsea-fc-loan-roundup-9-22-11 | title=Chelsea FC loan roundup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Kalas admitted that he did not yet know where he will be playing next season, but was happy on loan at Vitesse. "Ideally I'll stay another year at this club," he told. "Simply put, there are three options. I'll stay here, go back to Chelsea or they will loan me to another club abroad. In late March I will talk with my managers about next season and know more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7601619/Kalas-unsure-over-future | title=Kalas unsure over future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2012, Kalas scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute, for Vitesse against RKC Waalwijk; the match ended in a 3–1 win for Vitesse. This goal was Kalas' first goal of his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/05/17/netherlands/eredivisie/rkc-waalwijk/sbv-vitesse/1283674/ | title=RKC Waalwijk vs. Vitesse  1 – 3 |publisher=US Soccerway | accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2012, Kalas rejoined Vitesse on a new loan deal until the end of the [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13]] season. He also extended his contract with Chelsea until the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2841591,00.html | title=VITESSE LOANS FOR YOUNG PAIR | publisher=Chelseafc.com | accessdate=11 July 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714024653/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2841591,00.html | archivedate=14 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kalas scored his first Eredivisie goal of the season for Vitesse in a 3–0 defeat of [[FC Groningen]] on 16 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/gamecast/statistics/id/343517/statistics.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |title=FC Groningen 0 – 3 Vitesse Arnhem |publisher=ESPNFC |date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second loan spell at Vitesse, Kalas was mainly deployed as a right-back instead of his natural centre-back. Kalas ended up playing a total of 76 games overall competition during his two-year stay at Vitesse.

====2013–2015====
On 10 July 2013 Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] confirmed Kalas would stay and fight for his place at Chelsea for the coming season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3234245/title/mourinho-early-report---part-one|title=Home|website=ChelseaFC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802041005/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3234245/title/mourinho-early-report---part-one|archivedate=2 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Chelsea's 2013 pre-season Asia tour, Kalas made 3 appearances for Chelsea, in wins against the Singha All Stars, the Malaysian XI, and the Indonesian XI. During pre-season training, Kalas suffered fractured fibula, cutting his action with the first-team short as the rest of the team flew over to America for the [[2013 International Champions Cup|Guinness International Champions Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomas Kalas suffers fractured fibula and will be out for about a month|url=http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2013/7/30/4572860/tomas-kalas-injury-out-for-one-month/|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finally recovered from his injuries, Kalas made his competitive debut for the senior squad on 29 October 2013 as a substitute for Juan Mata, in a 2–0 win at Arsenal in the [[Football League Cup|Capital One Cup]]. Speaking of his role at Chelsea, Kalas said in an interview with a Czech chat show: "I am a player for training sessions. If they need a cone they put me there instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KHaring75/status/460396999670779904|title=Karel Häring|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2014, Kalas made his [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut against [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], replacing Willian in stoppage time; Chelsea won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea vs. Galatasaray  2 – 0

On 27 April 2014, Kalas was given his debut in the [[Premier League]] for Chelsea, at [[Anfield]] against Liverpool, starting in place of the injured [[John Terry]]. He played the whole 90 minutes in a 2–0 win that kept Chelsea in contention for the league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEAM NEWS: LIVERPOOL V CHELSEA|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/3790508/title/team-news-liverpool-v-chelsea|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2014, [[1. FC Köln]] announced that Kalas would spend the 2014–15 season on loan at their club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FC leiht Tomas Kalas aus|url=http://www.fc-koeln.de/news/detailansicht/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=7838&amp;cHash=94f330fc63ab4a1f13e2f770879a4c9a|publisher=1.

Kalas, himself, did not know why he had been given the cold shoulder at Köln, where he played only two reserve games. During an interview, Kalas said "At first they were happy with my performances but then I didn’t play in {{sic|any game}}. I don’t know what went wrong." With the lack of playing time, Kalas was linked to a move to multiple English clubs, as well as his former team Vitesse in the January 2015 [[transfer window]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomas Kalas set for change of scene with Chelsea 'nervous and disappointed' over Koln loan|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537270/Tomas-Kalas-Koln-loan-Chelsea-January-move|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–====
On 9 January 2015, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] announced that Kalas would spend the remainder of the 2014–15 season on loan at the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KALAS LOAN TO MIDDLESBROUGH|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/news/article/2014/chelsea-tomas-kalas-boro-aitor-karanka-stamford-bridge-2193371.aspx|accessdate=9 January 2015|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after signing with the Boro, Kalas made his debut for Middlesbrough in a 0–0 draw against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Sport – Reading v Middlesbrough|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30663415|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Aitor Karanka]] praised Kalas' aptitude to the right-back position, where Middlesbrough had been challenged following a long-term injury to [[Damià Abella]] in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomas Kalas: Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka happy with full-back|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30778977|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalas retained his position as the right-back against [[Huddersfield Town]] and [[Cardiff City]]. During the game against Cardiff City on 20 January 2015, Kalas suffered a high ankle sprain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middlesbrough vs. Cardiff City  2 – 1|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/20/england/championship/middlesbrough-football-club/cardiff-city-fc/1705283/|accessdate=20 January 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2015, Kalas returned to the starting line-up in a 2–1 away win against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blackpool vs Middlesbrough  1 – 2|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/02/10/england/championship/blackpool-fc/middlesbrough-football-club/1705353/|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2015, Kalas provided an assist to fellow Chelsea loanee [[Patrick Bamford]] as Middlesbrough beat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] 2–1 at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middlesbrough vs. Wolves  2 – 1|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3038837/Middlesbrough-2-1-Wolves-Patrick-Bamford-inspires-Boro-secure-play-position.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to regulations of a short-term loan, Kalas was unable to finish out his season playing for the Boro. Although he missed the final three games of the season, he did ask permission to stay with Middlesbrough and train with the team until the season finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomas Kalas, owned by Chelsea, discusses returning to loan club Middlesbrough|url=http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2015/04/20/tomas-kalas-owned-by-chelsea-discusses-returning-to-loan-club-mi/|accessdate=25 April 2015|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalas played a big role in the Boro making it to the [[2015 Football League play-offs|play-offs]], although they were unable to beat [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the final to achieve promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Middlesbrough 0–2 Norwich: Norwich returns to Premier League|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32776552|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
