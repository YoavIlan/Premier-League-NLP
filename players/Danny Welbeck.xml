'''Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck''' (born 26 November 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]]. He primarily plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but can also play as a [[Left winger|winger]].

Welbeck made his way through the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth teams at Manchester United]] before making his senior debut in 2008 and scoring in the process. He was with United when they won the [[2008–09 Football League Cup|2008–09 League Cup]] and the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]] before being sent on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and more recently [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. From the 2011–12 season, Welbeck was a regular figure in the Manchester United first team. He was transferred to Arsenal in September 2014 for a £16&amp;nbsp;million fee.

He made his senior England debut in March 2011 in a 1–1 friendly draw against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], the homeland of both of his parents. He scored his first senior international goal on 2 June 2012, the only goal in a friendly victory over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Welbeck has gone on to represent England at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], earning over 30 caps.

Welbeck signed his first trainee contract in July 2007, and started the 2007–08 season in the under-18 team, but was quickly promoted to the reserve team, making a number of substitute appearances.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Then, in January 2008, he was called up to the first team for the trip to Saudi Arabia to play [[Al-Hilal FC|Al-Hilal]] in [[Sami Al-Jaber]]'s [[testimonial match]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Welbeck made his debut in that match on 21 January 2008, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute for [[Anderson (footballer, born 1988)|Anderson]].

====Preston North End (loan)====
On 25 January 2010, Welbeck became Alex Ferguson's son [[Darren Ferguson]]'s first signing as [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] manager since he took charge earlier in the month, signing on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] for the remainder of the [[2009–10 Preston North End F.C. season|2009–10 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preston sign Manchester United's Danny Welbeck on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/preston/8478532.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his recovery, he took part in a training session at Manchester United's training ground, but his knee swelled up again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preston suffer Danny Welbeck Manchester United blow |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/preston/8562841.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury required surgery and Welbeck's loan was cut short on 16 March so that he could return to Manchester United for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welbeck blow |url=http://www.pnefc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10362~1996336,00.html |publisher=Preston North End F.C. |date=16 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323063159/http://www.pnefc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10362~1996336%2C00.html |archivedate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunderland (loan)====
[[File:Welbeck - Sunderland.jpg|thumb|upright|Welbeck with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2011]]

On 12 August 2010, Welbeck became [[Steve Bruce]]'s eighth summer signing after Sunderland signed the United striker on loan for the duration of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Welbeck secures Sunderland loan switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/8907769.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut for Sunderland came on 14 August as an 83rd-minute substitute for [[Darren Bent]] in a 2–2 home draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Whyatt |title=Sunderland 2–2 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8901729.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November, Welbeck scored his first Sunderland goal as he completed the scoring in a 3–0 away victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], rounding off what was described as an "impressive individual performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Chelsea 0–3 Sunderland |url=http://bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9180668.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 November 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, Welbeck scored his first home goals for Sunderland, striking twice in a 2–2 draw with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Barbuti |title=Sunderland 2–2 Everton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9191286.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===

He then provided an assist for Anderson in the 76th minute to make the score 2–0 before being substituted.

==Playing style==
Due to his height and running style, Welbeck has been compared to former Arsenal strikers [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] and [[Nwankwo Kanu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbert |first=Ian |title=Welbeck the pick of United's latest crop |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/welbeck-the-pick-of-uniteds-latest-crop-1634182.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Danny Welbeck profile |url=http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/115271/danny-welbeck |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but styled his game on another former Arsenal forward, his boyhood hero [[Thierry Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prodigious United Talent Hails Arsenal Legend |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/football/prodigious-united-talent-hails-arsenal-legend/23110 |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been known for his work-rate and has been described as strong, quick, and very good in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Mathieson |title=Welbeck hopes to follow Hughes path |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/welbeck-hopes-to-follow-hughes-path-940658 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
