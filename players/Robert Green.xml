[[File:Robert Green Norway-England 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Green playing for England in 2012]]

Green was named in England's squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Players List |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/22/85/78/fwc_2010_squadlists.pdf |publisher=FIFA |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Fabio Capello opted not to name his first choice goalkeeper until the day of England's opening match, against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on 12 June, at which point he selected Green to start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Capello defends goalkeeper delay |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/capello-defends-goalkeeper-delay |publisher=Professional Footballers' Association |date=13 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After England went into a 1–0 lead, Green failed to save a long-range shot from USA midfielder [[Clint Dempsey]] in the 40th minute. The incident saw the ball bounce on and off Green's gloves and go over the goal line. This is known as his World Cup mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=McNulty, Phil |title=England 1–1 USA |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_05 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in a 1–1 draw. Following this error and an unconvincing final training session on 17 June, Green was dropped. He was replaced by David James who played in England's next match, a 0–0 draw against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2010: David James will play against Algeria |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8747673.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England 0–0 Algeria|author=McNulty, Phil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_23|publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not appear again in the World Cup and was omitted from the first England squad named after the tournament for a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Green was brought back into the squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier]] against Montenegro in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goalkeeper Green recalled to squad for Montenegro qualifier|author=Sapa-dpa|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/article689425.ece/Goalkeeper-Green-recalled-to-squad-for-Montenegro-qualifier|publisher=Times Live|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006071206/http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/article689425.ece/Goalkeeper-Green-recalled-to-squad-for-Montenegro-qualifier|archivedate=6 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2012, new England manager [[Roy Hodgson]] named Green as part of his 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18081125|title=England Euro 2012 squad: Ruddy, Carroll &amp; Defoe in, Ferdinand out|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May, he made his first appearance since the World Cup, and kept a clean sheet as England defeated [[Norway national football team|Norway]] 1–0 in a friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18184726|title=Norway 0–1 England|author=McNulty, Phil |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In the summer of 2008, Green climbed [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] during a charity event for [[Amref Health Africa|AMREF]] (the African Medical and Research Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com/robertgreenkiliclimb |title=Robert Green's Kilimanjaro Climb |publisher=Justgiving.com |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that former Stoke City reserve-team goalkeeping coach Martin Phelan inspired him to become a goalkeeper after a talk at Green's primary school.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He is a fan of [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] and cited the club's long-time custodian [[Laurence Batty]] as another goalkeeping inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1635/ |title=Woking Football Club |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/alansmith/2393038/Deep-thinker-enjoys-life-on-the-big-stage.html |title=Deep thinker enjoys life on the big stage |first=By Alan |last=Smith |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green stated in an interview with Leeds United that he is studying at the [[Open University]] for a BA Hons Business Management Degree in order to have something to focus on after he retires from football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/21483/rob-green-the-perfect-degree-for-football-supporters |title=ROB GREEN: THE PERFECT DEGREE FOR FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS |publisher=Leeds United F.C. |date=7 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
