'''Ádám Bogdán''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈaːdaːm ˈboɡdaːn}}; born 27 September 1987) is a Hungarian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], on loan from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[Hungary national football team|Hungary national team]].

Bogdán began his career in Hungary at [[Vasas SC|Vasas]] before spending time on loan at [[Vecsési FC|Vecsés]]. In 2007, he moved to English club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], for whom he made 120 appearances across all competitions, before moving to Liverpool in 2015. Rarely used at Liverpool, he had a loan at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2016, cut short by injury.
 
He made his senior international debut in 2011. Bogdán has since earned 20 caps and represented Hungary in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Budapest]], Bogdán started his career with Hungarian [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I]] (Division One) team [[Vasas SC]]. He also had a loan spell at [[Vecsési FC|Vecsés]] where in his 9 games he impressed Bolton scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ÁDÁM BOGDÁN profile|url=http://www.hungarianfootball.com/player-profiles/adam-bogdan/|website=hungarianfootball.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolton Wanderers===
He signed for [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on a two-year contract on 1 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mark|last=Buckingham|title=Bolton bag Hungary keeper|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12875_2636279,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract was extended in 2009 until June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bogdan Thrilled To Extend His Deal|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1511375,00.html|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194006/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1511375,00.html|archivedate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Bogdán joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] team [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on a one-month [[loan (association football)|loan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Crewe sign Bolton keeper Bogdan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crewe_alexandra/8278719.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 29 September 2009 in a 3–2 home defeat to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], during which he made an error that cost Alexandra a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Crewe 2–3 Bury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8271066.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his Bolton debut in a 1–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 24 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Southampton 0–1 Bolton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8936599.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August 2010, Bogdán made his [[Premier League]] debut when he replaced [[Jussi Jääskeläinen]], who had been sent off for violent conduct, 37 minutes into the home game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Whyatt|first=Chris|title=Bolton 2–2 Birmingham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8946659.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start in the away game at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 11 September. Following Jääskeläinen's return, Bogdán returned to the bench but manager [[Owen Coyle]] gave Bogdán starts in both the League Cup and [[FA Cup]]. On 31 March 2011, he signed an extension to his existing contract, which would keep him at the club until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bolton tie down young goalkeeper Bogdán to new three-year deal at the Reebok|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1371872/Adam-Bogdan-signs-new-Bolton-contract-2014.html?|work=Daily Mail|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/9441933.stm|title=Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan signs contract until 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011–12 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2011–12 season]] gave Bogdán more playing time after Jääskeläinen suffered an injury during an international break,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/adam-bogdans-slow-rise-to-top-at-bolton-worth-the-wait|title=Adam Bogdan's slow rise to top at Bolton worth the wait|work=The National|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his first league game, on 2 October, he conceded five goals against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Jääskeläinen returned for the next league game. Three months later on 4 January, after Jääskeläinen suffered another injury, Bogdán returned for a game at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] where he was beaten by a 102-yard wind assisted clearance by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]] from his own penalty area in a 2–1 victory at [[Goodison Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Everton 1 – 2 Bolton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16343401.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2012, Bogdán saved a [[penalty kick]] from [[Wayne Rooney]], although Bolton lost 3–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/bolton_wanderers/s/1470802_adam-bogdan-out-to-be-boltons-no1|title=Adam Bogdan out to be Bolton's No.1 |work=Manchester Evening News|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed well during Jääskeläinen's absence and when the Finn returned from injury, Bogdán kept his place for the home game against Arsenal on 1 February, in which he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. Despite Jääskeläinen's return to full fitness, Bogdán remained first choice goalkeeper. On 11 March 2012, after Bolton's victory over [[QPR]], and on 1 April 2012, after Bolton's 3–2 victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Bogdán was selected for in the "team of the week" by [[Garth Crooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17334957|title=Garth Crooks's team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17580431|title=Garth Crooks's team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 April 2012|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2012, Bolton Wanderers held their annual end of season dinner, with Bogdán the recipient of the main accolade as he was named the club's Player of the Year, which is voted by the supporters.&lt;ref name="Bogdan Named Player Of The Year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2771857,00.html|title=Bogdan Named Player of the Year|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516081607/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2771857,00.html|archivedate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán admitted he felt mixed emotions after getting the award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2772157,00.html|title=Mixed Emotions For Bogdan|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516081618/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2772157,00.html|archivedate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the draw against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in Bolton's relegation from the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973085|title=Bolton's 11-year stay in the Premier League has come to an end after being held to a draw at Stoke|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdán signed a contract extension on 29 November 2012, which extended his contract to summer 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/contract-extension-for-bogdan-29.11.12-516528.aspx|title=Contract Extension For Bogdan|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014–15 season, Bogdán only made 10 appearances for Bolton, after being displaced as the team's first-choice goalkeeper by [[Andy Lonergan]].

===Liverpool===
On 12 June 2015, it was confirmed that Bogdán would join [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on a free transfer on 1 July, when his contract expired.&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33107895|title=Adam Bogdan: Liverpool sign Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2015|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 September, in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] third round tie against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] at [[Anfield]], and saved three penalties in the shootout, enabling his side to win the shootout 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool 1–1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34265500|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 December, he made his Premier League debut for the Reds in a 3–0 loss to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Vicarage Road]], dropping a corner kick after three minutes to allow [[Nathan Aké]] to open the scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=Matt|title=Watford 3–0 Liverpool: Nathan Ake capitalises on Adam Bogdan howler and Odion Ighalo strikes to condemn Jurgen Klopp's men to defeat as Hornets move a point off the Premier League top four|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3367794/Watford-3-0-Liverpool-Nathan-Ake-capitalises-Adam-Bogdan-howler-Odion-Ighalo-strikes-condemn-Jurgen-Klopp-s-men-defeat-Hornets-point-Premier-League-four.html|accessdate=21 December 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán also played in a much-changed Liverpool side away to [[Exeter City]] on 8 January 2016 in the third round of the FA Cup, conceding direct from [[Lee Holmes]]' corner kick in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35155398|title=Exeter City 2 – 2 Liverpool|date=8 January 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last match of the 2015–16 Premier League season, Bogdán was named in the starting line up against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] after a long absence from the first team squad. West Brom opened the scoring through [[Salomón Rondón]] in the 13th minute, before [[Jordon Ibe]] leveled in the 23rd minute – the match ended in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/05/15/england/premier-league/west-bromwich-albion-football-club/liverpool-fc/2043606/?ICID=PL_MS_04|title=West Bromwich 1 – 1 Liverpool|date=15 May 2016|work=Soccerway|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240499|title=West Bromwich Albion 1–1 Liverpool|date=15 May 2016|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2016, Bogdán joined Wigan Athletic on loan for the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Adam Bogdan joins Wigan on season-long loan |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/228317-adam-bogdan-joins-wigan-on-season-long-loan |publisher=Liverpool FC |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdán made 17 appearances for Wigan, keeping five clean sheets. In his final game, a 0–0 draw against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 19 November, Bogdán suffered a tear in his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and was substituted in the 59th minute. Bogdán then returned to his parent club Liverpool for rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-bogdan-returns-liverpool-after-12210823|title=Bogdan returns to Liverpool after loan deal cut short|last=Pearce|first=James|date=2016-11-22|work=liverpoolecho|accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2018, Bogdán moved on a season-long loan to [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44686135 |title=Adam Bogdan: Liverpool goalkeeper joins Hibs on loan |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2018 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
