'''Albin Kenneth Dahrup Zohore'''&lt;ref name="FIFAU17-squadlist" /&gt; (born 31 January 1994) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

He began his career in his native Denmark, making his professional debut for [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] at the age of 16, becoming the youngest player to play in the [[Danish Superliga]]. Regarded as a promising youngster, he joined Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in 2012 but struggled to break into the first-team and, following loan spells with [[Brøndby IF]] and [[IFK Göteborg]], he returned to Denmark on a permanent basis by joining [[Odense Boldklub|OB]] in 2015.

==Personal life==
Zohore was born in [[Copenhagen]] to a Danish mother and an Ivorian father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/superligaen/fcks-zohore-drogba-er-min-mentor |title=FCK's Zohore: Drogba er min mentor |publisher=bt.dk |language=Danish |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.violanews.com/altre-news/lex-viola-zohore-tiene-a-galla-per-ora-litalia/ |title=L’ex viola Zohore regala la qualificazione all’Italia |publisher=Viola News |author=Federico Generelli |language=Italian |date=24 June 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is the second cousin of former Chelsea striker [[Didier Drogba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCK's Zohore: Drogba is my mentor|url=http://www.sporten.dk/superligaen/fcks-zohore-drogba-er-min-mentor|work=Sporten.dk|publisher=[[Sporten.dk]]|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Copenhagen===
After spells with [[BK Skjold]] and  [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]], Zohore joined the youth system at [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], being promoted to the under-19 squad at the age of 15 in 2009. He joined the first-team's training camp in [[Marbella]], Spain, on 2 February 2010 together with Thobias Skovgaard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=754&amp;newsid=9963 |title=Afrejse tirsdag |accessdate=2010-02-03 |date=2010-02-01 |publisher=F.C. Copenhagen |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut for the club on 7 March 2010, at the age of 16 years and 35 days old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superstats.dk/spillere/alder-alltime |title=Yngst/aeldst |publisher=superstats.dk |language=Danish |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the youngest player to ever make his debut in the [[Danish Superliga]] after replacing [[César Santin]] in the 73rd minute during a 5–0 victory against [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]].&lt;ref name="skifter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=12286 |title=Kenneth Zohore skifter til Fiorentina |accessdate=2010-03-07 |date=2012-01-31 |publisher=[[fck.dk]] |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114933/http://fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=12286 |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rise-fall-rise-again-kenneth-12628614 |title=The rise, fall and rise again of Kenneth Zohore: An insight into Cardiff City's prodigious talent who lost his way |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Dominic Booth |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the match was his only appearance for the first-team during the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref name="Soccerway"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/kenneth-dahrup-zohore/136137/ |title=K. Zohore |publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2010, Zohore made his first [[UEFA Champions League]] appearance for Copenhagen, playing against [[FC Barcelona]] at [[Camp Nou]]. The 16-year-old striker replaced [[César Santin]] in the 74th minute of the game, becoming one of the youngest players ever to play in the Champion's League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/23/10-youngest-champions-league-debutants-including-juventus-moise/kenneth-zohore/ |title=The 10 youngest Champions League debutants including Juventus' Moise Kean – how did their careers pan out? |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, he scored his first senior goal for FC Copenhagen in the Danish Superliga against [[Lyngby Boldklub]]. He is the second youngest goalscorer ever in the Danish Superliga, after [[Mads Beierholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superstats.dk/spillere/alder-alltime?vis=MaalYngst |title=Yngste Malscorere, All-Time |publisher=superstats.dk |language=Danish |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zohore attracted attention from numerous clubs around Europe, spending time on trial at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], also being approached by Chelsea player Didier Drogba after the two sides met in a Champions League fixture, and [[Inter Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/den-nye-bendtner |title=Den nye Bendtner (The new Bendtner) |accessdate=2010-03-07 |date=2010-02-05 |publisher=[[Sporten.dk]] |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances saw him described as "one of the top striking prospects anywhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/6820678/zohore-reveals-drogba-chat |title=Zohore reveals Drogba 'chat' |publisher=Sky Sports |author=Richard Torgerson |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiorentina &amp; loan spells===
On 31 January 2012, FC Copenhagen announced that Zohore had signed for Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina]] on his 18th birthday for a fee in the region of £1 million.&lt;ref name="skifter"/&gt; He was given shirt no. 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legaseriea.it/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c539b06c-4a16-4487-8fe1-83f9efefdfb5&amp;groupId=10192 |title=Comunicati Stampa N°123 (2011–12) |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |publisher=Lega Serie A |language=Italian }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zohore never featured for the first team, later stating that he was "too young" to cope with the strong competition for places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/europei/2017/06/25/zohore-dalla-fiorentina-spinge-l-italia-in-semifinale.html |title=Da meteora viola a eroe, l'Italia ringrazia Zohore |publisher=Sky Sports |language=Italian |date=25 June 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2013, [[Brøndby IF]], managed by Zohore's former coach at Danish youth levels [[Thomas Frank (football manager)|Thomas Frank]], announced that they had agreed a deal with [[ACF Fiorentina]] to sign Zohore on a season-long loan with the option to buy at the end of the year for between €2.2 and €2.3 million.&lt;ref name="bt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.dk/superligaen/saadan-har-broendby-kokset-i-zohore-handel |title=Sådan har Brøndby kokset i Zohore-handel |publisher=bt.dk |language=Danish |date=28 July 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2013/08/08/kenneth-zohore-til-broendby-if |title=Kenneth Zohore to Brøndby IF |publisher=Brøndby IF |language=Danish |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brøndby paid a loan fee of nearly €100,000 to secure the move, beating off competition from German side [[Hannover 96]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jv.dk/sport/Saa-meget-skal-Broendby-betale-for-Zohore/artikel/1593204 |title=Så meget skal Brøndby betale for Zohore |publisher=Jydske Vestkysten |author=Søren Sorgenfri |language=Danish |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  however the transfer nearly collapsed close to completion as Brøndby were unaware of their need to pay Zohore's wages during the loan spell but the loan was eventually completed.&lt;ref name="bt"/&gt; Brøndby were hopeful of completing the transfer on a permanent basis but were unable to meet Fiorentina's valuation.&lt;ref name="juble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://3point.dk/zohore-vil-ikke-juble-hvis-han-scorer-mod-brondby/ |title=Zohore vil ikke juble, hvis han scorer mod Brøndby |publisher=3point.dk |author=Nanna Møller Karlsen |language=Danish |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2014 [[IFK Göteborg]] announced that Zohore had joined the club on a loan deal from Fiorentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/Nyheter/2014/Augusti/Klart-med-Zohore/ | title=Klart med Zohore | publisher=IFK Göteborg | date=11 August 2014 | accessdate=11 August 2014 | language=Swedish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915032129/http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/Nyheter/2014/Augusti/Klart-med-Zohore/# | archive-date=2014-09-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut 13 August 2014 in an away game against Åtvidaberg BK coming on as a substitute. In his home game debut against Brommapojkarna, 17 August 2014, Zohore scored his first goal for IFK Göteborg when he only had been on the pitch three minutes after coming on as a substitute in the 83rd minute.

===Odense Boldklub===
On 3 February 2015, Zohore returned to the Danish Superliga with [[Odense Boldklub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ob.dk/artikel/ob-skriver-kontrakt-med-kenneth-zohore.aspx |title=OB skriver kontrakt med Kenneth Zohore |accessdate=3 February 2015 |date=3 February 2015 |publisher=Odense Boldklub |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the termination of his contract with Fiorentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ob.dk/artikel/ob-saelger-kenneth-zohore.aspx|title=OB sælger Kenneth Zohore|last=Wamsler|first=Morten|date=1 February 2016|website=|publisher=Odense Boldklub|language=Danish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===
====2015–16====
On the final day of the winter transfer window in January 2016, Zohore joined Championship side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan from Belgian side [[K.V. Kortrijk]], a club also owned by Cardiff chairman [[Vincent Tan]], who signed him that same day from OB for a fee reported to be around £1 million.&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/details-kenneth-zohores-cardiff-city-10821063
