==Club career==
===Southampton===
[[File:Adam Lallana Southampton FC Manchester United 2012,13.png|thumb|left|upright|Lallana in 2012]]

Lallana was a member of the [[AFC Bournemouth]] Centre of Excellence, where he was spotted by a talent scout from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He joined the [[Premier League]] club's [[Southampton F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Saints Academy]] as a 12-year-old in September 2000. Southampton paid £3,000 compensation to Bournemouth with further payments of £5,000 and £10,000 when he signed scholarship and professional contracts respectively.&lt;ref name=Bank/&gt;

Lallana was involved in Southampton's [[FA Youth Cup]] squads of [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 2000s#2004–05:_Ipswich_Town_vs_Southampton_(1–0_and_2–2,_3–2_Aggregate)|2004–05]] and [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]], when they reached the final and semi-final respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Lallana joined the first team squad in July 2006, making his debut on 23 August 2006, in a 5–2 victory over [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]], in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/5266330.stm |title=Southampton 5–2 Yeovil |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October 2006 he signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lallana signs new deal |publisher=Southampton F.C. |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7672 |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091417/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7672 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2007 he joined Bournemouth on loan for one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lallana on loan |publisher=Southampton F.C. |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=9101 |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2008, Lallana scored his first professional goal for Southampton against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in a crucial Championship match, with a well-placed finish into the bottom left corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7356066.stm |title=West Brom 1–1 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a regular in the first team at the start of the 2008–09 season. On 29 August 2008, he signed a new three-year deal with the Saints.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

He finished the 2009–10 season with a total of twenty goals in all competitions, netting his 20th on the final day of the season against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. This made him the first Southampton midfielder to score twenty goals in a season since [[Matthew Le Tissier]]'s 30 in the 1994–95 season.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 7 January 2011, Lallana signed a new contract with Southampton which would expire in the summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Midfielder Signs Long Term Deal |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2261409,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=7 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110233558/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~2261409%2C00.html |archivedate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leitch |first=Adam |title=Lallana signs new Saints deal |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/8778862.Lallana_signs_new_Saints_deal/ |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |location=Southampton |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in the League One [[PFA Team of the Year]] for the 2010–11 season after scoring 11 goals that season.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13110874 |title=Spurs' Gareth Bale wins PFA player of the year award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then scored on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, a 3–1 victory over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[St Mary's Stadium]] which broke a 12-year hoodoo of Southampton not winning on the opening day and secured a record-breaking seventh consecutive league win. He then scored twice in a 5–2 victory at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. His 150th start for the club came in a 1–1 draw at south coast rivals [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. His tenth goal of the season came in a 4–0 victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. He then grabbed a brace in a 2–0 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He was nominated for the Player of the Year award but lost out to teammate [[Rickie Lambert]]. Along with Lambert and [[Kelvin Davis (footballer)|Kelvin Davis]], he was one of three Southampton players named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1112&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17797832 |title=Arsenal striker Robin van Persie named PFA Player of the Year |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on the final day of the campaign to finish with 13 goals, 11 of which came in the league.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

He made his first Premier League appearance on the opening day of the 2012–13 season, setting up a goal and wearing the captain's armband in a 3–2 defeat against 2011–12 champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19231354 "Man City 3–2 Southampton"] BBC Sport. 19 August 2012.

In Southampton's 4–1 Premier League victory over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 9 November 2013, Lallana started with the ball 30 yards from goal and dribbled his way past five players into the left-hand side of the 18-yard box, before slotting it past Hull goalkeeper [[Steve Harper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/09/southampton-hull-city-premier-league |title=Adam Lallana's brilliant goal helps Southampton crush feeble Hull City |date=9 November 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2014, he was named as one of the six players on the shortlist for the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27076251 |title=PFA award: Liverpool's Suarez, Gerrard &amp; Sturridge on shortlist |date=18 April 2014 |accessdate=19 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2014, he was named alongside teammate [[Luke Shaw]] in the PFA Team of the Year.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1314&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27180793 |title=Luis Suarez: Liverpool striker wins PFA Player of the Year award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May, he was crowned as both the Southampton Players' Player and Fans' Player of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Simon |title=2013/14 Player Awards The winners |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/06052014-player-awards-201314-the-winners-1539729.aspx |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=10 May 2014 |date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
====2014–2016====
[[File:Adam Lallana v Arsenal 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Lallana playing for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2014]]

Prior to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Lallana was subject to interest from Premier League runners-up [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. After long periods of negotiation Liverpool placed a reported £25&amp;nbsp;million bid which was accepted by Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool bid for Lallana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/01/adam-lallana-move-southampton-liverpool |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following England's return from the World Cup, Lallana signed for Liverpool, and was handed the number 20 shirt, the number he wore during his time at Southampton.
