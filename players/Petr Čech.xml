'''Petr Čech''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈpɛtr̩ ˈtʃɛx|-|Cs-Petr_Cech.ogg}}; born 20 May 1982) is a Czech professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

Born in [[Plzeň]], Čech began his senior career at [[FK Chmel Blšany|Chmel Blšany]] in 1999, where he played sporadically for two seasons prior to relocating to domestic superpower [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] in 2001. At age 19, Čech became a first team regular, and his single campaign with the club was fruitful, as he registered a league record of not conceding a goal in 903 competitive minutes. This garnered him his first move abroad, when he relocated to France to join [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] for a fee of €5.5 million (£3.9 million) in 2002.

In France, Čech starred in an under-performing team, and soon moved to Premier League side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee of £7 million (€9.8 million) in 2004, which was then a club record transfer for a goalkeeper. During his eleven year stay at the club, Čech registered 486 senior appearances, making him the club's highest overseas appearance maker, and sixth [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics#All-time appearances|all-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/300954/analysis|title=Mourinho's mistake|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=4 April 2014|work=BSkyB|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206152025/http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/300954/analysis|archivedate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped the club win four [[List of English football champions|Premier League titles]], four [[FA Cup]]s, three [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]s, one [[UEFA Europa League]] title, and one [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|UEFA Champions League]] title. He also holds the club [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics|all-time]] record for clean sheets, with 220. Čech departed Chelsea in 2015 to join city rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for a fee of £10 million, where he won another FA Cup and two [[FA Community Shield]]s.

A Czech international, Čech made his debut with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in 2002, and is the [[Czech Republic national football team#Most capped Czech Republic players|most capped player]] in the history of the Czech national team, with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|124 caps]]. He also represented his country at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], as well as the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]], [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]]. He was voted into the Euro 2004 All-Star team after helping the Czechs reach the semi-finals, and also served as the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]], prior to retiring from international competition in 2016. Čech also holds the record for the most [[Czech Footballer of the Year]] and [[Golden Ball (Czech Republic)|Czech Golden Ball]] wins. 
 
Considered one of the best goalkeepers of all time, Čech holds a number of goalkeeping records, including the [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] for fewest appearances required to reach 100 [[clean sheet]]s, having done so in 180 appearances, the most number of clean sheets in a season (24), as well as the record for the [[Premier League records and statistics#Goalkeepers|most clean sheets in Premier League history]] (202).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/2651/Petr-Cech/stats?co=1&amp;se=13|title=Petr Cech Statistics – 2004/05|accessdate=17 December 2017|work=premierleague.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paragraph Ten"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/2004-05|title=2004/05 Season Review|publisher=Premier League|date=n.d.|accessdate=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech is also the only goalkeeper to have won the [[Premier League Golden Glove]] with two separate clubs, and has won it a joint record four times; in [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05]], [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]], [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] and the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16]]. He was voted the [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper]] in 2005, received the award of Best Goalkeeper in the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|2004–05]], [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08]] editions of the UEFA Champions League, and went 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal in 2004–05, which was also a Premier League record.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Plzeň]], Czechoslovakia, Čech started playing football aged seven for Škoda Plzeň (later known as [[FC Viktoria Plzeň|Viktoria Plzeň]]). In his early days, he played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], although he later moved to the goalkeeper position.&lt;ref name=dmaugust0809&gt;{{cite news | last=Pattenden | first=Mike | date=8 August 2009 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1204489/The-greatest-save-life-The-day-Chelseas-Petr-Cech-died.html | title=The greatest save of my life: The day Chelsea's Petr Cech almost died | newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] | accessdate=1 April 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech joined [[Czech First League]] team [[FK Chmel Blšany|Chmel Blšany]] in June 1999&lt;ref name=idnes20010131&gt;{{cite news | last=Štrunc | first=Robert | date=31 January 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-sni-o-barcelone-ale-zamiril-do-sparty-f17-/fotbal.aspx?c=A010131_093352_fotbal_rou | title = Čech sní o Barceloně, ale zamířil do Sparty |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his league debut at the age of 17 in October 1999, in a 3–1 loss against Sparta.&lt;ref name=dmaugust0809/&gt;&lt;ref name=idnes20010131/&gt;

Čech signed a {{frac|5|1|2}}-year contract with [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] at the age of 18 in January 2001, although he remained at Blšany until the end of [[2000–01 Czech First League|the 2000–01 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=29 January 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-jde-do-sparty-ktera-preplatila-bremy-fp7-/fotbal.aspx?c=A010129_143341_fotbal_bra | title = Čech jde do Sparty, která přeplatila Brémy |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2001, Čech broke the record formerly held by [[Theodor Reimann]] for the longest time elapsed without conceding a goal in the Czech professional league, stretching his run to 855 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 4 November 2001 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/brankar-cech-si-hlidal-aby-mu-rekord-neutekl-fei-/fotbal.aspx?c=A011104_191941_fotbal_min | title=Brankář Čech si hlídal, aby mu rekord neutekl |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clean sheet record finally ended when he was beaten by a goal from [[Marcel Melecký]] of [[Bohemians 1905|Bohemians]] on 17 November 2001, ending his record at 903 consecutive minutes without conceding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Švéd | first = Jan | date = 14 July 2003 | url = http://fotbal.idnes.cz/rekordy-cech-nedostal-gol-903-minut-dl5-/fotbal.aspx?c=A030713_231554_fotbal_ruz | title = Rekordy: Čech nedostal gól 903 minut | language = Czech | work = Mladá fronta dnes | location = Czech Republic | publisher = Marfa | accessdate = 12 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Čech not winning the league title in the spring of 2002 with Sparta, he attracted interest from English clubs including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] due to his international performances. Due to difficulties in obtaining a work permit, however, a proposed deal with the ''Gunners'' fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/897742/petr-cech:-i-could-have-been-arsenal's-no.-1?cc=3436|title=Cech: Arsenal rejected me|date=23 March 2011|accessdate=3 April 2014|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rennes===
In July 2002, Čech moved to French club [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]], signing a four-year contract for a transfer fee reported as [[Czech koruna|CZK]]150 million ([[Euro|€]]5.5&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Novák | first=Jaromír | date=9 July 2002 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-nejde-do-anglie-ale-do-rennes-do9-/fotbal.aspx?c=A020709_124905_fotbal_min | title=Čech nejde do Anglie, ale do Rennes |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[2002–03 Ligue 1|first season]] in France, he was awarded [[man of the match]] against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] by ''[[L'Équipe]]''.&lt;ref name=frenchmom&gt;{{cite news | date=22 May 2003 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-je-nejlepsim-golmanem-ve-francii-dsk-/fot_zahranici.aspx?c=A030522_105806_fot_zahranici_min | title=Čech je nejlepším gólmanem ve Francii |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, Rennes was at the bottom of the league table,&lt;ref name=frenchmom/&gt; yet escaped relegation with a win over [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] in the final matchday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=24 May 2003 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/cech-vychytal-rennes-zachranu-dkb-/fot_zahranici.aspx?c=A030524_230756_fot_zahranici_min | title=Čech vychytal Rennes záchranu |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] made a transfer bid for Čech in January 2004 which was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3375791.stm |title=Chelsea Cech bid rejected |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 April 2008 | date=7 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in February Rennes agreed to Čech's move to Chelsea for [[Pound sterling|£]]7&amp;nbsp;million. Čech signed a five-year contract, to commence in July 2004, becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in Chelsea's history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3411707.stm |title=Chelsea sign Cech |work=BBC Sport | date=9 February 2004 | accessdate=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magicnumbers&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4470059.stm |title=Chelsea's magic numbers |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 April 2008 | date=30 April 2005 |first=Dan |last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech's was one amongst many British club transfers that came under the spotlight in the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football|2006 football corruption investigation]] for being potentially in breach of transfer regulations. The Stevens inquiry report, published in June 2007, found no evidence of illegal payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Drogba deal, Zihavi and five clubs in transfer spotlight | work= espnstar.com| date = 15 June 2007| url =http://espnstar.com/epl/epl_newsdetail_6191049.html|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071020210514/http://espnstar.com/epl/epl_newsdetail_6191049.html| archivedate =20 October 2007| accessdate =6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004–05 season====
When Čech arrived at Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini was established as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper. Cudicini, however, suffered a pre-season elbow injury that allowed Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] to promote Čech into the starting spot, where he became the first-choice goalkeeper in his first season. He kept a [[clean sheet]] in his [[Premier League]] debut in a 1–0 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cech content with debut |work=Sky Sports | url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/2308156/Cech-content-with-debut | accessdate =12 June 2013 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 March 2005, Čech set a new [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] of 1,025 minutes without letting in a goal, though his record has since been broken by Manchester United's [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Čech finally conceded to [[Leon McKenzie]] of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], after keeping a clean sheet in the league since 12 December 2004 when [[Thierry Henry]] scored for Arsenal.&lt;ref name=magicnumbers/&gt; Čech was given a special award by the Premier League for the new record, and he was also awarded the [[Premier League Golden Glove]] at the end of the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05 season]] for keeping a record 21 clean sheets in the Premier League.&lt;ref name=ext2008/&gt; The team, having conceded only 15 league goals in the entire season, also set a new record.

====2005–06 season====
Chelsea retained the Premier League title in the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06 season]], with Čech playing in 34 league matches. Chelsea conceded just 22 times during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =  English Premier League 2005–2006 : Table| work =  Statto.com| url =  http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2005-2006| accessdate =  17 August 2010| date =  17 August 2010| deadurl =  yes| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20120817022011/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/2005-2006| archivedate =  17 August 2012| df =  dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, he was named the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics|IFFHS]] World's Best Goalkeeper for 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=19 January 2006 | url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/young-czech-football-goalkeeper-petr-cech-named-best-in-world | title=Young Czech football goalkeeper Petr Cech named best in world |work=Czech Radio |location=Czech Republic |last=Willoughby |first=Ian |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Čech signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2010.&lt;ref name=ext2006&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2331566/Cech-rewarded-for-Chelsea-record-with-contract-to-2010.html |title=Cech rewarded for Chelsea record with contract to 2010 |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Johnson |first=William }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named the [[Czech Footballer of the Year]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=27 February 2006 | url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/brankar-cech-poprve-fotbalistou-roku-dwg-/fot_reprez.aspx?c=A060227_174522_fot_reprez_mn | title=Brankář Čech poprvé Fotbalistou roku |language=Czech |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic |publisher=MAFRA | accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robbencech.jpg|thumb|250px|Čech and [[Arjen Robben]] celebrate their second Premier League title in 2006.]]

====2006–07 season====
Čech underwent minor shoulder surgery on 27 June 2006 to repair a long-standing injury stemming from the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Keeper Cech has shoulder surgery |work=BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/5119818.stm | accessdate =6 September 2007 | date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to action on 27 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blackburn 0–2 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5266318.stm | accessdate =6 September 2007 | date=27 August 2006 | first=John | last=Sinnott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Head injury====
Čech sustained a head injury in the match against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the [[Madejski Stadium]] on 14 October 2006 when he collided with Reading midfielder [[Stephen Hunt (footballer, born 1981)|Stephen Hunt]] inside Chelsea's penalty area within the first minute of a Premier League match. Hunt's right knee hit Čech's head, leaving the goalkeeper requiring treatment.&lt;ref name=headinj&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/15/match.chelsea |title=Rattled Chelsea get better of Reading after keeper crisis |date=15 October 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |work=The Guardian  |location=London |last=Lawrence |first=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech was taken off after several minutes and replaced by Carlo Cudicini, who himself was knocked unconscious later in the same game, forcing Chelsea captain [[John Terry]] to play in goal for the match's remaining minutes.&lt;ref name=headinj/&gt; Čech underwent surgery for a [[skull fracture|depressed skull fracture]].&lt;ref name="BBC Cech surgery"&gt;{{cite news | date=15 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6053244.stm | title=Keeper Cech has surgery on skull |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially unaware of the seriousness of the injury, the doctors later reported that it nearly cost Čech his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cross | first=John | date=28 October 2006 | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=i-ll-be-back&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18005566&amp;siteid=94762-name_page.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020024939/http://mirror.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline%3Di-ll-be-back%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18005566%26siteid%3D94762-name_page.html | archivedate=20 October 2007 | title=I'LL BE BACK | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | accessdate=18 March 2012 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of the collision, he suffered intense headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=16 October 2006 | url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2006/October/16/doctors-cech-out-for-rest-of-season | title=Doctors: Cech out for rest of season | work=soccerway.com | accessdate=16 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103222/http://www.soccerway.com/news/2006/October/16/doctors-cech-out-for-rest-of-season | archivedate=29 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea manager José Mourinho blamed Hunt for Čech's injury, saying that his challenge was "a disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=14 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6052028.stm | title=Mourinho angry as keepers injured |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the South Central Ambulance Service [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/reading-and-nhs-failed-cech-claims-mourinho-420484.html |title=Reading and NHS failed Cech, claims Mourinho |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |work=The Independent  |last=Wallace |first=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt; and match referee [[Mike Riley (referee)|Mike Riley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=16 October 2006 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=410707&amp;in_page_id=1779 | title=Referee Riley: I did not make Cech leave the pitch for treatment | newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] | accessdate=21 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of commentators, including current and former goalkeepers, saw the incident as highlighting the need for greater protection for goalkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=17 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6057730.stm | title=Wenger fears for keepers' safety |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=19 October 2006 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/gabriele_marcotti/10/19/cech.keepers/index.html | title=English head games |work=Sports Illustrated | accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Čech was able to return home on 24 October 2006 and participated in light training the following week. Chelsea, however, announced that the goalkeeper would be out for three months, in line with medical advice on the time needed for complete recovery from the skull fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 October 2006|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/article.asp?hlid=424212&amp;m=10&amp;y=2006&amp;nav=news&amp;sub=latest+news|title=Cech home and set to train|work=chelseafc.com|accessdate=25 October 2006}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Čech said that he had no memory of the injury itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/27/newsstory.sport8|title=I don't remember Hunt collision, admits Cech|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=30 September 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return====
[[File:Petr Cech.jpg|thumb|left|Čech playing for Chelsea in 2007]]
Čech made his comeback in a Premier League match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 January 2007, which Chelsea eventually lost 2–0, wearing a [[scrum cap|rugby style headguard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6258681.stm |title=Liverpool 2–0 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date= 20 January 2007|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by [[Canterbury of New Zealand]] and carrying the manufacturer's logo. This caused friction with Czech national team sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]] and Chelsea's apparel manufacturer [[Adidas]]. The matter was resolved after the latter sponsor developed its own headgear for Čech to wear in club matches, while the player went on to wear an unbranded cap for national team games.&lt;ref name=sponsor2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/3701996/Petr-Cech-follows-Zinedine-Zidane-in-sponsorship-deal-Football.html |title=Petr Cech follows Zinedine Zidane in sponsorship deal |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |last=Benammar |first=Emily }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even long after his injuries healed completely, Čech has continued to wear the cap to his matches.

Although Chelsea lost Čech's comeback match, he then went approximately 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. On 11 April 2007, Čech was awarded the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for the first time in his career, in recognition of his eight successive league clean sheets. He was the first goalkeeper to receive the award since [[Tim Flowers]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 April 2007 |url=http://www.czech.cz/en/news/sport/petr-cech-named-player-of-the-month/ |title=Petr Cech named player of the month |work=czech.cz |accessdate=6 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012333/http://www.czech.cz/en/news/sport/petr-cech-named-player-of-the-month/ |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This run was ended during a 4–1 Chelsea victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 18 April 2007 when [[Carlos Tevez]] scored against him.

Čech also kept a clean sheet for Chelsea in the [[2007 FA Cup Final|2007 FA Cup final]] against Manchester United. He and United's Edwin van der Sar shared the honour of being the first goalkeepers to keep a clean sheet over 90 minutes in a competitive fixture at the new [[Wembley Stadium]], but Čech became the first goalkeeper to end a competitive game unbeaten, as Chelsea beat United 1–0 to win the FA Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6649815.stm |title=Chelsea 1–0 Manchester United |work=BBC Sport |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie |date= 19 May 2007|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007–08 season====
[[File:Petr Čech.jpg|thumb|right|Čech training for Chelsea in 2008]]
Čech started the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]] conceding two goals against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the first match of the season. Despite this, Chelsea managed to win 3–2 and set an English record for their 64th consecutive unbeaten league match at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=221289&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ENG.1 |title=Report: Chelsea vs Birmingham – English Premier League |work=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Čech suffered an injury to his right calf muscle in the 0–0 [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage|UEFA Champions League group stage]] match at [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].&lt;ref name=inj2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8841884.stm |title=Chelsea keeper Petr Cech may miss Premier League start  |work=BBC Sport |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on 23 December 2007, he had to be replaced during a match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] due to a hip injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7145750.stm |title=Blackburn 0–1 Chelsea |work=BBC Sport |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea suffered its first major blow when it lost the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with Čech [[parrying]] the ball onto [[Jonathan Woodgate]]'s head for the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=235283&amp;cc=5901 |title=Report: Tottenham vs Chelsea – English Carling Cup |work=ESPNsoccernet |date=24 February 2008 | accessdate = 9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in several games until the eve of Chelsea's home Champions League tie with Greek champions [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] when he injured his ankle in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/03/06/sfnche206.xml |title=Petr Cech hit by injury setback |date=6 March 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Ley |first=John |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508205418/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2008%2F03%2F06%2Fsfnche206.xml |archivedate=8 May 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11945_3243941,00.html |title=Cech suffers ankle injury |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks that followed, Čech missed key games of Chelsea's campaign, including the [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|derby with Arsenal]] and both legs of the Champions League quarter-final.

On 7 April 2008, it was announced that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on his chin and lips following an accidental collision with [[Tal Ben Haim]] during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7334884.stm |title=Chelsea ready to risk keeper Cech |work=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=523722&amp;cc=5901 |title=Cech out for two weeks after fifty stitch operation |work=ESPNsoccernet |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin and missed 22 games due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goalies find their fate in coaches' hands| author=Rob Hughes|work=International Herald Tribune| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/08/sports/SOCCER.1.php| date =8 April 2008| accessdate =8 April 2008}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].

====2008–09 season====
[[File:Petr Cech training.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Čech before Chelsea's first game of the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09]] season against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]]]
Čech signed a new five-year contract in July 2008 to keep him at Chelsea until 2013.&lt;ref name=ext2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/2437931/Petr-Cech-signs-five-year-extension-at-Chelsea-with-Michael-Essien-set-to-follow.html |title=Petr Cech signs five-year extension at Chelsea with Michael Essien set to follow |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |work=The Telegraph |last=Wilson |first=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea started the [[2008–09 Chelsea F.C. season|2008–09 season]] in good form, conceding only 7 goals in 17 games and keeping 11 clean sheets, 10 of which with Čech in goal.

In November 2008, Chelsea beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 5–0 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], a game which marked the 100th match Čech had played for Chelsea without conceding a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/09/premier-league-chelsea-blackburn |title=Cech the century maker makes case for defence |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2009 |work=The Guardian  |location=London |last=Castles |first=Duncan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea had a 1–0 victory over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] on his 200th appearance for the club, and he also starred in a 1–0 away victory at [[Villa Park]] against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], saving from [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]] and [[Gareth Barry]]. The following week, Čech helped Chelsea move up to second place in the league by saving from [[Paul Scharner]] in the first half against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea won 2–1. Successive clean sheets by Čech in Chelsea's wins against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] saw his side consolidate their position in the Premier League whilst progressing into the [[2008–09 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals. Čech also made saves from [[Dirk Kuyt]] and [[Xabi Alonso]] as Chelsea beat Liverpool 3–1 at [[Anfield]] in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals.

In a crucial Premier League game in April 2009, with Chelsea comfortably leading 4–0 against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], Chelsea manager [[Guus Hiddink]] took off both [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Frank Lampard]] only for Bolton to score three late goals which questioned the Chelsea defence, and in particular Čech. Čech, however, responded when he saved a penalty from [[Mark Noble]] in Chelsea's 1–0 win at the [[Boleyn Ground]] against West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham 0–1 Chelsea |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8000577.stm|accessdate=14 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept a clean sheet in the next game against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] during the Champions League semi-final first leg match. Following a 3–2 win against Sunderland at the [[Stadium of Light]], Čech and Chelsea finished the season with the joint-tightest defence in the Premier League along with Manchester United, having conceded just 24 goals over the course of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/table/default.stm |title=Premier League table |date=24 May 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2009 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite conceding the fastest goal in [[List of FA Cup finals|FA Cup final]] history, Čech helped Chelsea's [[2009 FA Cup Final|2009 FA Cup final]] triumph over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Chelsea won 2–1, earning the Czech his seventh trophy at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8060989.stm |title=Chelsea 2–1 Everton |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2009 |work=BBC Sport |last=Bevan |first=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chelsea coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] accused Čech, [[Michael Ballack]] and Drogba of causing his sacking, saying that they "did not accept my training methods or my demands". Scolari also said that it stemmed from a row between him and the Czech goalkeeper over the latter's alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was "disappointed with [Scolari] because never in my life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/06/petr-cech-carlo-ancelotti-chelsea |title=Petr Cech says Carlo Ancelotti is "ideal" man for Chelsea |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |work=The Guardian  |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Čech began the [[2009–10 Chelsea F.C. season|2009–10 season]] in winning form with Chelsea, beating Manchester United in the [[2009 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] final at Wembley. With the game level at 2–2 at the end of normal time, Čech saved penalties from [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Patrice Evra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8190061.stm |title=Chelsea 2 – 2 Man Utd |date=9 August 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |work=BBC Sport |last=McNulty |first=Phil }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Čech kept goal for Chelsea in the six-match winning run that opened their season and placed them on top of the [[2009–10 Premier League|Premier League]].

On 18 March 2014, Čech made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–0 win over [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] at Stamford Bridge. He became the fourth goalkeeper to make a century of appearances in the competition after [[Iker Casillas]], [[Victor Valdés]] and [[Oliver Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2068181.html|title=Čech becomes latest member of 100 club|date=18 March 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2014, Čech was substituted in the first leg of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final against Atlético Madrid with a shoulder injury. Chelsea manager José Mourinho stated that the injury would prevent Čech from playing again in the [[2013–14 Chelsea F.C. season|2013–14 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27121526|title=Chelsea: John Terry &amp; Petr Cech injured for Premier League run-in|date=22 April 2014|accessdate=23 April 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the injury, Čech would finish the season as the joint winner of the Premier League Golden Glove award along with Arsenal goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]], both keeping 16 clean sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/liverpool-star-suarez-named-barclays-player-season-14051390935 |title=Liverpool star Suarez named Barclays Player of the Season |publisher=talksport |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Čech's place as Chelsea's starting goalkeeper was taken at the start of the season by [[Thibaut Courtois]]. This was possibly due to Čech's long standing injury concerns to his shoulder, back and knees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2051245/Petr-Cech-Chelsea-future-doubt-says-Thibaut-Courtois.html|title=Time's running out for Cech: Rookie Courtois casts doubt over keeper's future|publisher=Daily Mail|date=20 October 2011|accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2014, Čech made his first appearance of the season against Bolton in the third round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], a 2–1 victory.

Despite him being second choice, Mourinho stated that Čech would not be sold in the January 2015 transfer window due to third-choice [[Mark Schwarzer]] leaving for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea as Mark Schwarzer joins Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30675920|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that month, Čech made back to back starts in the Premier League against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at home, followed by [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] away from home, keeping clean-sheets in both wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea 2–0 Newcastle|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/395574/statistics.html|work=ESPN|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swansea City 0–5 Chelsea |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/395563/statistics.html|work=ESPN|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2015, Čech started in goal in the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup final]] against Tottenham Hotspur, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory to win the trophy for the third time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/01/chelsea-tottenham-capital-one-cup-final-match-report|title=Terry drives Chelsea to Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham|date=1 March 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

{{wikinews|Petr Čech retires from international football}}
Čech first represented his country in November 1997 with the under-15 team, working his way up through different age groups before making his senior debut for the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in February 2002. He first came to prominence as a 20-year-old at the [[2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2002 U-21 European Championships]] when his [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] heroics in the final against [[France national under-21 football team|France]], letting in only one of the penalty kicks, earned the [[Czech Republic national under-21 football team|Czech Republic]] their first title at youth level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Čech sparks Czech party|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/history/season=2002/index.html|publisher=UEFA|date=1 June 2002|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing himself as the senior team's first choice goalkeeper, Čech was selected in the Czech Republic's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. Čech's saves helped his team progress as far as the semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on the [[silver goal]] rule. He was named in the all-star team as best goalkeeper at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC Sport|title=Zagorakis named top player|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/greece/3866823.stm|date=5 July 2004|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech Republic qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], held in Germany, and were placed in Group E, alongside [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. The Czech Republic finished third in their group, following a 3–0 win against the United States, and two losses against Ghana and Italy, the score 2–0 in both games, thus not qualifying for the knock-out stages of the tournament.

On 17 October 2007, Čech captained the Czech Republic team in their [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] Group D qualifier against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. He kept a clean sheet and the Czechs defeated Germany 3–0 away to book their place for the finals in Austria and Switzerland. In the last group game of the final tournament, Čech was beaten three times in the final 15 minutes as [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] overcame a two-goal deficit to knock the Czechs out. Čech had a cross slip through his hands, allowing [[Nihat Kahveci]] to score Turkey's equalizing goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Euro 2008: Petr Cech blames himself for Czech Republic's spectacular collapse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/2303385/Euro-2008-Petr-Cech-blames-himself-for-Czech-Republics-spectacular-collapse.html|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=13 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
