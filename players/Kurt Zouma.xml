On 10 August 2018, Zouma joined fellow Premier League side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan for the [[2018–19 Everton F.C. season|2018–19]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/08/10/zouma|title=Zouma Joins Everton On Season-Long Loan|date=10 August 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018|publisher=Everton Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 25 August as a last-minute substitute for the injured [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]] in a 2–2 draw at [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutcliffe |first1=Steve |title=Bournemouth 2&amp;ndash;2 Everton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45230638 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zouma scored his first goal for Everton on 13 January 2019, a header to open a 2–0 home win also against Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunter |first1=Andy |title=Kurt Zouma nods home to steer Everton towards nervy win over Bournemouth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off for dissent after the final whistle in a 1–0 loss at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 9 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prentice |first1=David |title=Everton defender Kurt Zouma red-carded AFTER the final whistle at Watford |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-defender-kurt-zouma-red-15806796 |accessdate=17 February 2019 |work=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Zouma is a [[France national youth football team|France youth international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] and [[France national under-17 football team|under-17]] level. He played with the under-17 team at the [[2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] and [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Zouma has been the captain for the [[France national under-21 football team|French under-21]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zouma strike makes it a perfect six for France|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000412/match=2011566/postmatch/report/index.html|publisher=UEFA|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[France national under-20 football team|under-20 team]] that won the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2013 World Cup]] in Turkey. In the quarter-finals against [[Uzbekistan national under-20 football team|Uzbekistan]] in [[Rize]], he headed the last goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbeks no match for in-form France|url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/matches/round=259231/match=300234903/match-report.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|publisher=FIFA|date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] wanted to build a defence around Zouma and fellow youngster [[Raphaël Varane]],&lt;ref name=four/&gt; and on 19 March 2015, he was called him up for the first time for friendlies against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=Nabil Fekir and Kurt Zouma named in France squad for friendlies|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/international-friendly/story/2356374/nabil-fekir-and-kurt-zouma-named-in-france-squad-for-friendlies|accessdate=20 March 2015|publisher=ESPN|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the latter match ten days later, a 2–0 win at his former club ground with Saint-Étienne, the [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], replacing [[Morgan Schneiderlin]] for the last eight minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France 2–0 Denmark: Lacazette and Giroud on target|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/france-vs-denmark/1703395/report?ICID=MP_MS_5|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Goal.com|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his injury for Chelsea in February, Zouma missed France's hosting of [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref name=injury/&gt;

He returned to the squad in August 2017, replacing the injured [[Raphaël Varane]] for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualifier]] against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-uefa/story/3190974/stoke-defender-kurt-zouma-replaces-raphael-varane-in-france-squad |title=Stoke defender Kurt Zouma replaces Raphael Varane in France squad |date=28 August 2017 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was put on standby for France's squad at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Michael|title=World Cup 2018: Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City stars included in France's squad for finals|url=https://talksport.com/football/world-cup-2018-chelsea-manchester-united-and-manchester-city-stars-included-frances-squad|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=Talksport|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma earned his first France cap in over three years on 11 October 2018 as a substitute in a 2–2 friendly draw with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], coming on as a substitute and winning the equalising penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pringle |first1=Ben |title=Chelsea player ratings – International break: Morata and Giroud flop again, Ampadu injured |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1030543/Chelsea-player-ratings-international-break-Morata-Giroud-Ampadu |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Daily Express |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Kurt Zouma (03-08-2011).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zouma with Saint-Étienne in 2011]]
A November 2013 report by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' noted Zouma's strength, reading of the game, and aerial presence, while mentioning his occasional lapses in concentration.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Tim|title=Everything you need to know about... Kurt Zouma|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/everything-you-need-know-about-kurt-zouma#:LTIsiA1MqkpNyA|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=FourFourTwo|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Zouma was named by British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. The newspaper wrote, "Blessed with exceptional power and technique, Zouma is also coveted by many for his leadership qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/19/next-10-big-things-europes-top-youngsters|title=The next 10 big things: Europe's top youngsters and stars of the future|date=18 January 2014|work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Match of the Day]]'' pundit, [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] linked Zouma to [[Marcel Desailly]], another Frenchman who played in defence for Chelsea. Writing after a draw with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], which included a strong run and perfectly-executed sliding tackle on [[Sergio Agüero]], Murphy noted Zouma's reliability and confidence against the strong opponent, in addition to his pace. He predicted that Zouma could be a Chelsea mainstay for years to come, and would be an ideal replacement for captain [[John Terry]], then aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Danny|title=Chelsea 1–1 Man City: 'Kurt Zouma reminds me of Marcel Desailly'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31078757|accessdate=1 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawcross called Zouma the "ultimate defender" for his speed, jump, passing, shooting and tackling, and said that [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Toby Alderweireld]] was the only central defender on his level.&lt;ref name=shawcross/&gt;

==Personal life==
Zouma's parents emigrated to France from the [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France: Kurt Zouma parle de la paix en Centrafrique|trans-title=France: Kurt Zouma speaks of peace in the Central African Republic|url=http://www.journaldebangui.com/article.php?aid=7416|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=Journal de Bangui|date=8 October 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother [[Lionel Zouma|Lionel]] plays in the same position for French club [[Football Bourg-en-Bresse Péronnas 01|Bourg-en Bresse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les retrouvailles des " jumeaux " Zouma|trans-title=The reunion of the Zouma "twins"|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/sports/les-retrouvailles-des-jumeaux-zouma-23-03-2014-3697943.php|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=23 March 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is named after Kurt Sloane, [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]'s character in the 1989 film [[Kickboxer (1989 film)|''Kickboxer'']], while his middle name Happy reflects an African tradition of using positive words as middle names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Menezes|first1=Jack|title=Chelsea vs Aston Villa: Kurt Zouma reveals he is named after Jean-Claude Van Damme...and why he has reason to smile all the time|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-vs-aston-villa-kurt-zouma-reveals-he-is-named-after-jean-claude-van-dammeand-why-he-has-9755954.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=The Independent|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zouma is married to Sandra, with whom he has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo: Chelsea star relaxes with his kids at Stamford Bridge|url=http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/12/photo-chelsea-star-relaxes-with-his-kids-at-stamford-bridge/|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=The Sports Review|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea star Kurt Zouma takes his family to Disneyland Paris|url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2794277/chelsea-star-kurt-zouma-takes-his-family-to-disneyland-paris|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=[[ESPN]] Soccer |author=Liam Twomey|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
