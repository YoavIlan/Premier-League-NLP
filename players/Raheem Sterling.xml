====Contract dispute====
On 9 February 2015, Brendan Rodgers said that Sterling had been offered "an incredible deal" to stay at Liverpool, rumoured to be a new contract worth £100,000 a week, but he also stated Liverpool were "certainly not a club that is going to give way, way above what a player is worth at a certain time in their career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Andy |title=Rodgers: Raheem Sterling has been offered 'incredible deal' to stay at Liverpool FC |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/rodgers-raheem-sterling-been-offered-8608794 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 20 March, Rodgers said Sterling's contract situation would not be resolved until the summer at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Andy |title=Rodgers:No Liverpool FC deal with Raheem Sterling before the summer – Brendan Rodgers |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/no-liverpool-fc-deal-raheem-8887385 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, Sterling gave an unsanctioned interview with the [[BBC]], where he confirmed he had turned down a new deal, but denied that this was for reasons of money. He had two years of a £35,000 per week contract remaining and said that he would not negotiate a new contract until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pirks |first=Natalie |title=Raheem Sterling: Liverpool forward turns down new deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32149613 |accessdate=1 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Brendan Rodgers slammed Sterling's advisors (Aidy Ward) on the interview, saying, "You are not a 20-year-old boy and you pick up the phone and ask to speak to the BBC. You don't do it. Him in particular. But, of course, if he is asked to do that by other parties then that is what he'll do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brendan Rodgers slams Raheem Sterling's advisers over interview |url=http://www.espnfc.com/liverpool/story/2381200/brendan-rodgers-slams-raheem-sterlings-advisers-over-interview |accessdate=10 July 2015 |website=ESPN FC |date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May, amid rumours that Sterling intended to leave the club his agent, Aidy Ward gave an interview to the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' saying, "I don't care about the PR of the club and the club situation... He is definitely not signing. He's not signing for £700, £800, £900 thousand a week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore-Bridger |first=Benedict |title=Raheem Sterling's agent Aidy Ward confirms star wants to leave Liverpool: '£900k-a-week would not keep him at Anfield' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/raheem-sterlings-agent-aidy-ward-confirms-star-wants-to-leave-liverpool-900000aweek-would-not-keep-him-at-anfield-10266233.html |accessdate=10 July 2015 |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June, Liverpool reportedly rejected an initial bid of £30&amp;nbsp;million from Manchester City. One week later, they reportedly rejected a second bid from City for £40&amp;nbsp;million, with Liverpool valuing Sterling at £50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Ben |title=Raheem Sterling: Man City's second bid rejected by Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33161310 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling reportedly later asked to be left out of Liverpool's preseason tour to Asia, and missed two days of training through illness, which was met with widespread criticism from former Liverpool players, including [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Graeme Souness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Steven Gerrard 'disappointed' with Liverpool man |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33473145 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Souness |first=Graeme |title=Raheem Sterling turning his back on Liverpool |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/29328/9857804/raheem-sterling-turning-his-back-on-liverpool-says-graeme-souness |accessdate=10 July 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
Following England's [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup campaign]], Sterling made an immediate return to the Manchester City starting line-up.

In December 2018, Sterling alleged that sections of the media served to "fuel racism" with their portrayal of young black footballers. The comments emerged after Sterling was subjected to alleged racist abuse during City's 2–0 defeat at Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/09/raheem-sterling-newspapers-fuelling-racism-alleged-abuse-chelsea|title=Raheem Sterling accuses media of ‘fuelling racism’ after alleged abuse|last=Fifield|first=Dominic|date=9 December 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=9 December 2018|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterling's international career coincided with the introduction of the "[[Home Nations' gentlemen's agreement|home nations agreement]]." It was not until September 2009 that [[FIFA]] agreed to the proposals by the English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh Football Associations to update the agreement, allowing players who were educated in their nation for five years or more to become eligible for their national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Driver eligible for Scotland |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Driver-eligible-for-Scotland-article185879.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=6 October 2013 |date=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling first represented England at under-16 level in November 2009 in a match against Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raheem Sterling profile |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/S/Raheem-Sterling |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking of the possibility of playing for Jamaica, Sterling said, "When it comes to that decision, that is when I will decide, but if Jamaica calls for me, why not?"&lt;ref name="gleaner-2009-11-11"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Arthur |title=Jamaican takes UK youth football by storm |newspaper=The Gleaner |location=Kingston |page=1 |date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterling made his senior debut for England on 14 November 2012, starting in a friendly away to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20306158 |title=Sweden 4–2 England |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 2014, Sterling earned his second cap and was named [[man of the match]] as England beat [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 1–0 in a friendly match at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/03/06/hodgson-impressed-englands-young-lions |title=Hodgson impressed by England's young lions |date=6 March 2014 |publisher=Special Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jordan-henderson-hails-raheem-sterling-6778138 |title=Henderson hails 'fearless' Sterling after winger's man-of-the-match performance for England |date=6 March 2014 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2014, Sterling was named in England's 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/3790/world-cup-2014/2014/05/12/4813050/wilshere-oxlade-chamberlain-in-as-hodgson-names-youthful-england-?ICID=HP_HN_1 |title=Wilshere &amp; Oxlade-Chamberlain in as Hodgson names youthful England 2014 World Cup squad |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2014 |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pre-tournament friendly on 4 June, against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in Miami on his fourth cap, Sterling slid into [[Antonio Valencia]], who reacted by grabbing Sterling's neck; both received red cards for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling was sent off and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a worrying knee injury as England produced a mixed display to draw with Ecuador in their World Cup warm-up game in Miami |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27383424 |accessdate=4 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2014 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valencia later apologised for his reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Antonio Valencia 'sorry' after sending off in clash with Raheem Sterling |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ecuador/10876898/Antonio-Valencia-sorry-after-sending-off-in-clash-with-Raheem-Sterling.html |accessdate=5 June 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Valencia sorry for grabbing Sterling |url=http://www.espnfc.com/ecuador/story/1862789/antonio-valencia-sorry-for-grabbing-raheem-sterlings-neck |accessdate=5 June 2014 |website=ESPN FC |date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 June, Sterling started in England's opening group match, a 2–1 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Manaus]], and was rated as the team's best performing player by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27853470 |title=England v Italy: How Roy Hodgson's men rated in Manaus |date=15 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a run of 27 games without a goal for England, Sterling scored twice in a [[UEFA Nations League]] group game against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on 15 October 2018. England went on to win the match 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Raheem Sterling ends his England goal drought in superb style |first=Jackson |last=Cole |publisher=talkSPORT |date=15 October 2018 |access-date=18 October 2018 |url=https://talksport.com/football/433744/raheem-sterling-ends-goal-drought-england-spain-uefa-nations-league/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Sterling plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]], [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], though he is more comfortable as a natural winger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/11314938/Raheem-Sterling-is-maturing-into-a-proper-striker-at-Liverpool-insists-Brendan-Rodgers.html "Raheem Sterling is maturing into a proper striker at Liverpool, insists Brendan Rodgers"].

Former [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] midfielder [[Xavi]] said in November 2014 that Sterling is good enough to play for the [[La Liga]] club, praising his physical and technical qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool's Raheem Sterling good enough to play for Barcelona, says Xavi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/11/liverpool-raheem-sterling-barcelona-xavi |accessdate=15 November 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emperors &amp; Empires: Barcelona's Xavi discusses the modern game in exclusive interview |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/emperors-empires-barcelonas-xavi-discusses-the-modern-game/217333 |first=Sanjit |last=Atwal |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014 |publisher=Squawka News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, ''[[BBC Sport]]'' columnist Phil McNulty wrote that Sterling was "very good with the potential to be outstanding" but remained a "work in progress" due to inconsistent performances. He also wrote, "He is blessed with natural pace that makes even the best defences and defenders take a step back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Raheem Sterling is not the finished article at Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32147641 |accessdate=1 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
In 2013, citing the influence of his mother, Sterling was quoted as saying he was "not 100 per cent religious but my belief is strong. When the time is right, I will fully be Christian."  He added that he put his faith in God and that he prays regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fcs-raheem-sterling-happy-3325424 |title=Liverpool FC's Raheem Sterling happy to keep taking the hits – so long as he's contributing to goals |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one daughter, Melody Rose, born in 2012 after a brief relationship.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

On 8 August 2013, Sterling was arrested for an alleged common assault on his former girlfriend, a model. He was found not guilty at Liverpool Magistrates Court on 20 September, when the complainant was unable to offer consistent evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=De Menezes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-winger-raheem-sterling-arrested-on-charge-of-assault-8754230.html |title=Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrested on charge of assault |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/20/raheem-sterling-cleared-assault |title=Liverpool's Raheem Sterling cleared of assault on former girlfriend |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months earlier, on 20 May 2013, a charge of common assault on a different woman was dropped after a witness failed to turn up to court.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Liverpool winger bids to shed bad boy image |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26774538 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Sterling was photographed by the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' allegedly smoking a [[Hookah|shisha pipe]], and by [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] allegedly inhaling [[nitrous oxide]] for recreational purposes. Manager Brendan Rodgers said, "I don't think it is something you should be doing, it's as simple as that...Young players make mistakes. As long as they learn from them, that is what is important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Liverpool star alleged to have taken laughing gas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32295792 |accessdate=14 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] in which 71 people died, Sterling made a "substantial" donation to those affected by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ornstein |first=David |title=Grenfell Tower fire: Man City winger Raheem Sterling to make donation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40297310 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2017, Sterling was attacked outside Manchester City's training ground by a man who used racist language towards him. Four days later, 29-year-old Karl Anderson, a convicted football hooligan, pleaded guilty to racially aggravated common assault and was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison and a £100 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: hooligan admits racially aggravated attack on Man City winger |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42429178 |accessdate=20 December 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' praised Sterling's resilience and courage in deciding to play only four hours afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/22/why-we-should-take-our-hats-off-to-raheem-sterling |title=Abuse of easy target Raheem Sterling leaves bitter taste in mouth |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Barney Ronay |date=22 December 2017 |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterling has an [[M16 rifle]] tattooed on his leg. He received criticism from anti-violence groups but said that the tattoo had deeper meaning and referred to his father who was killed when Sterling was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44285455 |title=England striker defends gun tattoo |date=29 May 2018 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of Sterling by Britain's tabloid media, especially ''The Sun'', has been deemed unfair and racist by pundits including [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raheem Sterling: Manchester City winger is targeted by racism, says Ian Wright |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45177178 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mcleod |first1=Maurice |title=As Raheem Sterling knows, successful black men have targets on their back |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/raheem-sterling-media-young-black-men-footballer-tattoo |accessdate=13 August 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stopes |first1=Harry |title=The Press v.

===Sponsorship===
In 2012, Sterling signed a sponsorship deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. He appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside [[Mario Götze]], [[Theo Walcott]], [[Eden Hazard]], [[Christian Eriksen]] and [[Stephan El Shaarawy]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/7951-liverpools-raheem-sterling-wears-the-nike-gs2.html |title=Raheem Sterling Wears the Nike GS2 |publisher=Football Boots |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/nike-gs.html |title=Nike GS2 Football Boots |website=FootballBoots.co.uk |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, he modelled the new [[Nike Mercurial Vapor]] IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpHaaLJs1QY |title=Nike Mercurial Vapor IX – Raheem Sterling |via=YouTube |publisher=Copa90 |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
