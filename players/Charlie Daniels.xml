He was inducted into the [[Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum|Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame Inductees |url=https://www.cfdrodeo.com/cfd-old-west-museum/our-story/history/cheyenne-frontier-days-hall-of-fame-inductees |website=Cheyenne Frontier Days |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Owens |first=Jonathan |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |dead-url=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520022821/http://jonbowens.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/charlie-daniels-inducted-into-opry-hall-of-fame |url=http://jonbowens.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/charlie-daniels-inducted-into-opry-hall-of-fame |title=Charlie Daniels inducted into Opry Hall of Fame |newspaper=[[The Sanford Herald]] |date=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1623747/rascal-flatts-perform-with-toto-during-musicians-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony.jhtml|title=News: Rascal Flatts Perform With Toto During Musicians Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony |first=Calvin |last=Gilbert |work=[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] |date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watts |first=Cindy |title=Randy Travis, Charlie Daniels, Fred Foster to be inducted to Country Music Hall of Fame |newspaper=[[The Tennesseean]] |date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Daniels was born October 28, 1936, in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], and raised on a musical diet that included Pentecostal gospel, local bluegrass bands, and the rhythm &amp; blues and country music from Nashville's 50,000-watt radio stations [[WLAC]] and [[WSM (AM)]]. In 2016, he shared memories of his youth and baseball in Wilmington when he wrote the foreword for a book on the [[Tobacco State League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tobacco State League; A North Carolina Baseball History, 1946–1950|author-last=Holaday|author-first=Chris|publisher=McFarland|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4766-6670-9|location=Jefferson, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, Daniels moved to the small town of [[Gulf, North Carolina|Gulf, Chatham County, North Carolina]]. He graduated from high school in 1955. Already skilled on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, he formed a rock 'n' roll band and hit the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/daniels_charlie/bio.jhtml|title=Charlie Daniels Biography|work=[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]|accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1964, Daniels co-wrote "It Hurts Me" (a song which [[Elvis Presley]] recorded) with his friend, producer [[Bob Johnston]], under Bob's wife's name, Joy Byers.&lt;!-- Simmons, Sylvie (2012). I’m Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen. Random House LLC. ISBN 9780771080425. --&gt; He worked as a Nashville [[session musician]], often for Johnston, including playing guitar and electric bass on three [[Bob Dylan]] albums during 1969 and 1970, and on recordings by [[Leonard Cohen]]. Daniels recorded his first solo album, ''Charlie Daniels'', in 1971 (see [[1971 in country music]]). He also produced the 1969 album by [[the Youngbloods]], ''[[Elephant Mountain]]''.

His first hit, the [[novelty song]] "[[Uneasy Rider]]", was from his 1973 third album, ''Honey in the Rock'', and reached No.9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:CharlieDaniels265-1000.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Daniels in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]]]]
During this period, Daniels played fiddle on many of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]]'s early albums: "A New Life", "Where We All Belong", "Searchin' For a Rainbow", "Long Hard Ride" and "Carolina Dreams". Daniels can be heard on the live portion of the "Where We All Belong" album, recorded in Milwaukee on July 31, 1974.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The same year, he organized the first in a series of [[Volunteer Jam]] concerts based in or around [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, often playing with members of [[Barefoot Jerry]]. Except for a three-year gap in the late 1980s, the Jams continued until 1996. In 1999, the first of several Volunteer Jam Tours began, and in 2015, a Jam celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first Volunteer Jam was held at [[Bridgestone Arena]], and another followed in 2016 celebrating his 80th birthday. In 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band with the [[Southern rock]] self-identification anthem "The South's Gonna Do It Again". "[[Long Haired Country Boy]]" was a minor hit in that year. Daniels played fiddle on [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s 1975 album ''[[Hank Williams, Jr. and Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class= album | id=hank-williams-jr-friends-mca-special-products-mw0000313538 |tab=credits |label=''Hank Williams, Jr. &amp; Friends'' |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance]] in 1979 for "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in September 1979.  The following year, "Devil" became a major crossover success on rock radio stations after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the hit movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', in which he made an onscreen appearance. The song still receives regular airplay on U.S. classic rock and country stations. A [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[cover version]] of the song was included in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' as the final [[guitar battle]] against the last boss (Lou, the [[devil]]).  Daniels has openly stated his opposition to the metal cover and the devil winning occasionally in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2008/soapbox-2008-040408.htm |title=Charlie Daniels Profile |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003070904/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2008/soapbox-2008-040408.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Daniels pop hits included "[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]" (#11 in 1980), "[[The Legend of Wooley Swamp]]" (#31 in 1980), and "[[Still in Saigon]]" (#22 in 1982).  In 1980, Daniels participated in the country music concept album, ''[[The Legend of Jesse James]]''. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several of Daniels' albums and singles were hits on the [[country music|Country]] charts and the music continues to receive airplay on country stations today.  Daniels released several [[gospel music|Gospel]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] records.  In 1999, he made a guest vocal appearance on his song "All Night Long" with Montgomery Gentry (Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry) for their debut album, "Tattoos and Scars," which was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandnote.com/people.php?keyword=montgomery+gentry&amp;scode=timeline&amp;submit=Go&amp;page=3|title=RolandNotes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels' distinctive speaking voice was used in [[Frank Wildhorn]]'s 1999 musical, ''[[The Civil War (musical)|The Civil War]]''. He is featured in the Prologue and "In Great Deeds". Daniels was inducted into the [[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Inductees|url=http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/category/inductees/1999-inductees|work=[[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charlie Daniels at Louisville Waterfront Park, Kentucky, April 29, 2009.jpg|thumb|Daniels at [[Louisville Waterfront Park]], Kentucky, April 29, 2009]]

He guest starred as himself on two episodes of ''[[King of the Hill]]'', "Peggy's Fan Fair," which aired on May 21, 2000 and "The Bluegrass is Always Greener", which aired on February 24, 2002. In 2005, he made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song "[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]". In 2006, he appeared with [[Little Richard]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and other musicians as the backup band for Williams' opening sequence to ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2006-06-09-williams-mnf_x.htm|title=USA Today|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels now resides in [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee]], where the city has named a park after him. He continues to tour regularly. He appeared in commercials for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in 2002 with other celebrities convincing [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Jarrett]] to race the UPS Truck.

[[Joel DiGregorio|William Joel "Taz" DiGregorio]], Daniels' keyboardist, died in a car accident in Cheatham County, Tennessee, on October 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlie-daniels-joel-taz-digregorio-dies-248314 |title=Charlie Daniels Original Joel 'Taz' DiGregorio Dies In Crash |first=Erik |last=Pedersen |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=13 October 2011 |issn=0018-3660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Daniels officially became a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] along with fellow tar heels [[Randy Travis]] and producer [[Fred Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/contentpages/charlie-daniels|title=Charlie Daniels|website=Country Music Hall of Fame|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[HarperCollins|Harper Collins]] announced that Daniels' memoir, ''Never Look at the Empty Seats'', would be released on October 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/news?n_id=1541|title=News {{!}} The Charlie Daniels Band|last=LTD.|first=BubbleUp,|website=www.charliedaniels.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Charlie Daniels at NavSta Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003]]
Daniels' public politics have been varied and idiosyncratic, tending toward in his late career a general [[American conservatism|rightward]] progression. His earliest hit, "Uneasy Rider," portrayed him as a country boy in the counterculture movement, caught in an argument with right-wingers at a "redneck" bar. "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[President of the United States|presidential]] bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=M.C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |date=1996 |publisher=Canongate Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0862416043 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]" was a reaction to the 1979–1981 [[Iran Hostage Crisis]] and the troubled American economy of the later 1970s; despite the turmoil the song described a patriotic, united America where "we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank/That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks." The song experienced a revival following the [[September 11 attacks]], when it was floated around the internet as "F*** [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]".

In 1989, Daniels' country hit "Simple Man" was interpreted by some as advocating [[vigilantism]]. Lyrics such as "Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest," garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.

In 2003, Daniels published an ''Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch'' in defense of President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] policy. His 2003 book ''Ain't No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag'' contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize [[John Kerry]]'s service record but that Kerry should allow the release of his official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409190807/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archivedate=2005-04-09 |title=Zell Miller |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |date=April 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His band's official website contains a "soapbox" page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soap-box|title=Soap Box|last=|first=|date=|work=The Charlie Daniels Band|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Daniels has made statements such as the following: "In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory" and "I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists" regarding [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]]. On March 27, 2009, Daniels criticized the [[Obama Administration]] for "changing the name of the War on Terror to the "[[War on Terror|Overseas Contingency Operation]]" and referring to terrorism as "man-caused disasters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's Finally Happened |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |date=March 27, 2009 |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2009/soapbox-2009-0327.htm |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403081913/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2009/soapbox-2009-0327.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Daniels lambasted [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] for signing the [[Reproductive Health Act]], which legalized abortion until birth under some circumstances, [[Twitter|tweeting]], "Watch the wrinkles on Cuomo’s face lengthen as the ramifications of the thousands of murders he has sanctioned come to bear on him. The [[New York General Assembly|NY legislature]] has created a new [[Auschwitz]] dedicated to the execution of a whole segment of defenseless citizens. [[Satan]] is smiling."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-music-legend-charlie-daniels-blasts-new-york-gov-for-new-abortion-law Music legend Charlie Daniels blasts NY's Dem governor over new abortion law: 'Satan is smiling'] (Fox News)&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980, while digging fence post holes on his farm near Mount Juliet, where he lives. He suffered three complete breaks in his right arm, and two broken fingers when his shirtsleeve caught on a spinning auger. The injury required surgery, and sidelined him for four months.&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 1"&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=January 30, 1980 |title=Country-Rock Singer Charlie Daniels Hurt In Farm Accident |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pp5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2784%2C5419318 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Daniels on his medical recovery: 'Doctors treat and God heals'|url=http://www.today.com/health/charlie-daniels-his-medical-recovery-doctors-treat-god-heals-2D79468130 |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of [[pneumonia]] and admitted to a [[Nashville]] hospital for a series of routine tests.
