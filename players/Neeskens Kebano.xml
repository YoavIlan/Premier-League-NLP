==Club career==

===Early career===
Kebano was born in the commune of [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]], Île-de-France. He was given the first name ''Neeskens'' as a homage to the former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch international]] [[midfielder]] [[Johan Neeskens]] whom his father, Nestor Kebano, was a big admirer of.&lt;ref name="kebano_montereau"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://montereau.typepad.fr/montereau/2006/09/neeskens_kebano.html | title = Neeskens Kebano: "le PSG est une fierté teintée de lucidité" | date = 25 September 2006 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]] | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721022301/http://montereau.typepad.fr/montereau/2006/09/neeskens_kebano.html | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/actualite/528319.shtml | title = Kebano: "Etre digne de cette convocation" | date = 23 March 2009 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/1140-neeskens-kebano-en-hommage-a-johan-neeskens.html | title = Neeskens Kebano en hommage à Johan Neeskens | date = 26 March 2009 | work = Espoirs du Football | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kebano was immersed into football at an early age and began his career playing for hometown club ASA Montereau.&lt;ref name ="kebano_montereau"/&gt; While at Montereau, he also competed in judo before opting to focus on football.&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"/&gt; In 2004, Kebano was among a host of players attempting to earn selection to the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] academy.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fK4HAw1oHYIJ:lestitisdupsg.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!237F13A51E00435!12725.entry%3F%26_c02_owner%3D1+Neeskens+Kebano+techniquement&amp;cd=25&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com | title = Interview N°213: Neeskens Kebano | date = 10 October 2009 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | publisher = Les Titis du PSG | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the academy's detection camp, he drew interest from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] scout Pierre Reynaud. The club contacted the player and offered him a trial at the club, which he accepted. After spending the 2005 season playing at Montereau, Kebano was contacted again by Paris Saint-Germain who brought him in for a second trial in December 2005. In the following January, the club signed him on an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract and he joined the club in July 2006.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt;

===Paris Saint-Germain===
Kebano began his Paris Saint-Germain career at the club's youth academy in the [[Camp des Loges]]. He was placed on the club's under-14 team and formed friendships with youth and international teammates Jimmy Kamghain, Alassane Tambe, and Bastien Héry.&lt;ref name ="kebano_future"/&gt; The combination of the four were particularly instrumental in their youth team's success. With the under-14 team, Kebano won the ''Championnat Fédéraux de 14 ans''.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt; In the next season with the club's under-15 team, he played on the team that won the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]]. The team won its league, the Division d'Honneur, and also captured the Coupe de Paris.&lt;ref name ="kebano_psg"/&gt; At under-16 level, Paris Saint-Germain and Kebano won the ''Championnat National des 16 ans''. Though, he is still eligible to compete at youth level, ahead of the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 season]], Kebano was promoted to the club's [[Championnat de France amateur]] team in the fourth division. He was also placed onto the club's squad for the [[UEFA Europa League]] being assigned the number 38 shirt by manager [[Antoine Kombouaré]].

Kebano made his amateur debut on 8 August 2010 in a 1–0 victory over [[FC Bourg-Péronnas|Bourg-Péronnas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Paris SG B v. Bourg-Péronnas Match Report | url = http://www.foot-national.com/fiche-match-football-24081.html | date = 8 August 2010 | work = Foot-National | accessdate = 2 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, he scored his first amateur goal in a 4–1 win over [[Monts d'Or Azergues Foot|Monts d'Or Azergues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Monts d'Or Azergues v.

He appeared on the substitute's bench, but failed to make his debut as Paris Saint-Germain and Karpaty drew 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000128/match=2003039/index.html | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Karpaty and PSG make their point |language = French |date = 15 December 2010 | accessdate = 30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the winter break, Kebano returned to the club's reserve team and spent January playing with the team. In February 2011, he was called back up to the senior team after being named to the 18-man roster to play amateur club [[FC Martigues|Martigues]] in the [[Coupe de France]]. On 2 February, Kebano made his professional debut in the match appearing as a substitute for [[Mevlüt Erdinç]] in a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/14841-neeskens-kebano-debute-en-pro.html | title = Neeskens Kebano débute en pro | date = 2 February 2011 | work = Espoirs du Football | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/73932 | title = Martigues v.
