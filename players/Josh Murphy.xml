==Personal life==
Murphy was born in [[Wembley]], London.&lt;ref name=Hugman/&gt; 

The twins spoke about their close bonds and being there for each other.&lt;ref name="TheDuoatNorwichCity"/&gt; Their parents and younger brother live in [[Downham Market]] and run the Arbuckles restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mum is the word for Norwich City starlet Josh Murphy|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/mum_is_the_word_for_norwich_city_starlet_josh_murphy_1_2809818|work=Eastern Daily Press 24|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
