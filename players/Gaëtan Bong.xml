'''Thomas Gaëtan Bong''' (born 25 April 1988) is a Cameroonian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for English club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] and the [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon national team]]. He previously played club football for [[FC Metz|Metz]], [[Tours FC|Tours]], [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], [[Olympiacos FC|Olympiacos]] and [[Wigan Athletic]] and represented [[France national under-21 football team|France at under-21 level]] before switching to his native Cameroon.

==Personal life==

Born in Cameroon, Bong grew up in France.

==Career==

===Early career and Valenciennes===
Bong began his career in the youth side for [[FC Metz|Metz]] and was loaned out for the 2008–09 season to [[Ligue 2]] club [[Tours FC|Tours]]. On 29 July 2009, the 21-year-old left Metz to sign a four-year deal with [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]] for £595,000, where he made 117 overall appearances for the club and scored 4 goals.

===2013–14 with Olympiacos===
On 19 of August 2013 he signed a contract with [[Olympiacos FC|Olympiacos]] for £850,000, where he played 19 games and scored 1 goal against [[Asteras Tripoli]] in the [[Greek Cup]]. Bong helped Olympiacos win their 41st [[Superleague Greece]] title this season. 
Bong also made 4 appearances in the [[UEFA Champions League]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Wigan Athletic===
On 2 February 2015, Bong signed for English club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on a short-term contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wiganathletic.com/news/2015/february/gaetan-bong-joins-wigan-athletic/ |title=Gaëtan Bong joins Wigan Athletic |publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C. |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released at the end of the season following Wigan's relegation from the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wiganathletic.com/news/2015/may/players-contracts-update/ |title=Players' contract update |publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C. |date=18 May 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
====2015–16====
In June 2015, Bong joined [[EFL Championship]] side [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] on a free transfer, signing an initial two-year contract with the south coast club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33374876 |title=Gaetan Bong: Brighton sign Cameroon international left-back |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared regularly for the club until tearing his tendon in October 2015, ruling him out for 21 games throughout the season. He would only appear as a substitute for the rest of the season, making three appearances. He also played in the playoffs, as the club lost to [[Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals 3–1 on aggregate.

====2016–17====
In the 2016–17 season, Bong was again a regular for the first half of the year, however due to persistent injuries he was not included in the squad for much of the second half apart from three games: a victory against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], another against Wigan, and a loss to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Brighton finished the season as runners up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], gaining automatic promotion to the [[Premier League]].

Bong's contract was due to expire at the end of the season, however he signed a new one-year contract with the club as Brighton aim to survive their first Premier League season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2017/may/bong-signs-new-contract/|title=Bong signs new contract|first=James |last=Hilsum |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|date=30 May 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18====
Bong played two matches for Brighton in the [[EFL Cup]], the second a 1–0 away defeat against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth]]. He made his Premier League debut in a 2–0 away defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 1 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41376506|title=Arsenal 2–0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion |first=Timothy |last=Abraham |publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started for Albion in their next five league games as they embarked on an unbeaten run that saw the club reach as high as 8th place in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41964596 |title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2–2 Stoke City |first=Alex |last=Bysouth |publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2017 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, Bong was involved in an incident with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] striker [[Romelu Lukaku]] in Brighton's 1–0 league defeat at Old Trafford, where Lukaku attempted to kick Bong twice in Brighton's penalty area. Lukaku ultimately did not face retrospective action for the incident, with referee Neil Swarbrick's report confirming that he had not seen the incident, but the FA panel could not reach a unanimous verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11146659/manchester-uniteds-romelu-lukaku-facing-no-disciplinary-action-for-gaetan-bong-clash|title=Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku facing no disciplinary action for Gaetan Bong clash|publisher=Sky Sports|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bong accused [[Jay Rodriguez]] of making a racist remark during a 2–0 defeat at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 13 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/01/15/albion-defender-requests-full-investigation-of-allegations-against-west-brom-player/|title=Albion defender requests ‘full investigation’ of allegations against West Brom player|date=15 January 2018|work=Brighton and Hove News|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Brom forward was charged by the Football Association on 8 February in relation to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/feb/08/jay-rodriguez-charged-080218|title=Jay Rodriguez charged|publisher=The Football Association|date=8 February 2018|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were later found not proven by the F.A. due to lack of evidence, but the FA was "completely satisfied" Bong's complaint was "made in absolute good faith" and "there has been no suggestion that this was a malicious or fabricated complaint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Fifield| first1=Dominic|title=FA finds allegations of racial abuse by Jay Rodriguez ‘not proven’| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/jay-rodriguez-west-brom-cleared-racial-abuse|accessdate=29 April 2018|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Rodriguez: Charge of racially abusing Gaetan Bong 'not proven'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43744840|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February, Bong signed a one-year contract extension, committing him to Brighton until 30 June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/02/28/brighton-and-hove-albion-defender-signs-contract-extension/|title=Brighton and Hove Albion defender signs contract extension|last=le Duc|first=Frank|date=28 February 2018|work=Brighton and Hove News|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Bong was eligible to play for either [[France national football team|France]], where he grew up, or [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], where he was born. He played one international match for the France U21, before opting to play for Cameroon.

Bong played one match for Cameroon in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in Cameroon's last group match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], where Cameroon lost 2–1. Cameroon lost all three group games, finishing bottom of Group E of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
