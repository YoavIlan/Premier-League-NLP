'''Craig George Cathcart''' (born 6 February 1989) is a Northern Irish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]]. He has also captained his country's [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21 side]].

A product of the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] youth academy, Cathcart spent time on loan at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]], and English [[Football League Championship]] sides [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and Watford, before joining newly promoted [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in 2010. Cathcart returned to Watford in July 2014 on a permanent deal.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Belfast]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Cathcart was spotted playing football for [[Glengormley High School]] at the age of 14, and, despite being coveted by clubs like [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] upon winning the Northern Ireland Youth Player of the Year award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart tipped for the top |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/3028231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he began training at the Manchester United School of Excellence in Belfast. He signed trainee terms at Manchester United in July 2005, and turned professional on his 17th birthday in February 2006. Cathcart became a regular in the Manchester United Under-18s team, and was a member of the Under-17s team that played at the 2007 Northern Ireland Milk Cup, scoring the first goal in a 5–0 win over Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fitzmaurice hits four for Orchard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5231658.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006–07 season, he was made captain of the United youth team that reached the [[FA Youth Cup]] Final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Report: United 1 Boro 0 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=412217 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he missed both legs of the final, the first through selection for the first team and the second through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=FAYC: Liverpool 1 United 2 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=419944 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=16 April 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Youth Cup Final: Show your support |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=421878 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
On 19 March 2007, Cathcart received his first call-up to the Manchester United senior squad for the [[FA Cup]] Sixth Round replay with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathan |last=Mercer |title=Man Utd 1–0 Middlesbrough |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6461727.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an injury to [[Nemanja Vidić]], Cathcart was promoted to the first team squad as cover on 31 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Vidic injury blow confirmed |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=415856 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unused substitute in Manchester United's 7–1 win against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] less than two weeks later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Man Utd 7–1 Roma (agg 8–3) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6534975.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[FA Cup]] semi-final victory over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] a further four days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Watford 1–4 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6534697.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 2–0 Sheff Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6555231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation that this defensive injury crisis would lead to Cathcart making his senior debut ended when he suffered a season-ending knee injury during training after the match against Sheffield United. As a result, he also missed the second leg of the FA Youth Cup final; he had already missed the first leg due to his call-up to the senior squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Injuries continue to mount |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=421283 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his injury, Cathcart's performances in the club's youth teams earned him the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy#Players of the Year|Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award]] for the 2006–07 season.

===Loan to Antwerp===
At the start of the 2007–08 season, Cathcart was sent on a half-season loan to United's Belgian feeder club, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], to gain match experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Youngster heads to Antwerp |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=467176 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the Belgians on 22 September 2007, in a match against [[R.O.C. de Charleroi-Marchienne|OC Charleroi]]. The next game saw Cathcart score Antwerp's only goal of the game in a 4–1 loss to [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]]. He scored again in a match against [[A.F.C. Tubize|Tubize]], to earn a 1–1 draw, and also the Man of the Match award. He made a further nine appearances for "The Great Old", to bring his total to 13, before returning to Manchester United at the end of 2007.
Although he was not originally selected for the squad, Cathcart was briefly called up to the Manchester United first team for their tour of South Africa on 24 July 2008, and played the full 90 minutes in the team's 4–0 victory over [[Kaizer Chiefs FC|Kaizer Chiefs]] on 26 July, his first appearance for the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Boss hails Vodacom triumph |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6614705 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then came on as a 66th-minute substitute for [[Jonny Evans]] in a match against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in Nigeria the following day, before then coming on for [[Wes Brown]] at half-time in a friendly against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on 4 August.

===Loans to the Championship===
On 8 August 2008, in a search for first-team football, Cathcart joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], on loan until the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cart Before The Start |url=http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1361126,00.html |publisher=pafc.co.uk |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904111051/http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10364~1361126%2C00.html |archivedate=4 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later extended to the entire 2008–09 season, as Cathcart has quickly become a regular at Home Park. He scored his first Plymouth goal in their 3–1 defeat at home to Ipswich in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plymouth 1–3 Ipswich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7674398.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart returned to Manchester United at the end of the 2008–09 season and played in two pre-season friendlies for the reserve team before joining up with the first team for the [[Audi Cup]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart revels in senior start |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=6637023 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Nemanja Vidić]] suffered a calf strain in the warm-up before the semi-final against [[Boca Juniors]], Cathcart was promoted to the starting XI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Antonio aces Reds bow |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={F9E570E6-407E-44BC-800F-4A3110258114}&amp;newsid=6636983 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United won the match 2–1, with Cathcart giving a good performance, although he did head the ball against his own crossbar midway through the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boca Juniors 1 United 2 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={3165B97F-681E-4B39-BE53-94EC9521C3DA}&amp;newsid=6636981 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |page=3 |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart scored the opening goal in a 3–1 away win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C. Reserves and Academy|Bolton Wanderers]] in the first game of the [[2009–10 Premier Reserve League]] season on 24 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=Reserves: Bolton 1 United 3 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=6638312 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Cathcart was sought after by a number of [[Football League Championship|Championship]] sides, and Manchester United received a bid of £1.25m from a Championship side but United preferred a loan deal. [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] both showed an interest in the young defender, but he instead signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on loan until 4 January 2010, where he joined fellow Old Trafford teammate Tom Cleverley and Arsenal youngster Henri Lansbury on loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cathcart joins the Hornets |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1796407,00.html |work=watfordfc.com |publisher=Watford FC |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923193244/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10400~1796407%2C00.html |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackpool===
[[File:Craig Cathcart.jpg|thumb|150px|Cathcart playing for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in 2010]]
On 11 August 2010, Cathcart signed for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] for an undisclosed fee, after agreeing a three-year contract, with an option for a further year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackpool sign quartet ahead of Premier League debut |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackpool/8904013.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he made his debut as Blackpool marked their Premier League debut with a 4–0 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the [[DW Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Wigan 0–4 Blackpool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8904972.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in the Premier League with a powerful header against his former club, Manchester United, at [[Bloomfield Road]] on 25 January 2011; the 15th-minute goal opened the scoring for the match, but Blackpool went on to lose 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Blackpool 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9371173.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
On 24 June 2014, Cathcart agreed terms on a two-year deal with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] having been out-of-contract at Blackpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Craig Cathcart: Watford sign Blackpool defender|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27995525|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially became a Watford player on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFICIAL: Cathcart Returns|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140624-craig-cathcart-signs-for-watford-1668448.aspx|publisher=watfordfc.com|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=24 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628162920/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140624-craig-cathcart-signs-for-watford-1668448.aspx|archivedate=28 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart's first Watford appearance came as a substitute for [[Gabriel Tamaș]] against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] on 20 September 2014, scoring an equalising goal on his debut. He went on to become an integral part of the team and scored twice more as the club were promoted to the Premier League. Cathcart's impressive season did not go unnoticed, and he signed a new four-year deal on 2 July 2015.

==International career==
Cathcart has been involved with the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]] since Under-17 level, and was part of the team that attempted to [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite qualification|qualify]] for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2006 European Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NI Under-17 European hopes dashed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/4854680.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2006, still just 17 years old, Cathcart had been promoted to the [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Northern Ireland Under-21 team]], and was named in the squad for a friendly against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] on 14 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millar names squad for Germany |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6137482.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2006 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Cathcart was selected in the European squad for the [[2007 UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup|2007 Meridian Cup]], a competition between two "all-star" Under-18 teams from Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europe's Meridian squad selected |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridian/news/kind=1/newsid=509113.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 February 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219054347/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridian/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D509113.html |archivedate=19 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his first call-up, Cathcart has been a regular name in Northern Ireland Under-21 squads, and has so far made seven appearances for the team, the most recent being a 3–0 defeat by [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] on 5 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round=15084/match=300219/report=lu.html |title=Germany 3–0 Northern Ireland&amp;nbsp;– Lineups |accessdate=10 November 2008 |date=5 September 2008 |work=uefa.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101133837/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round%3D15084/match%3D300219/report%3Dlu.html |archivedate=1 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathcart was called up to the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] squad in May 2009, along with nine other uncapped players for the international [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 6 June.&lt;ref name="Irish League quintet in NI squad "&gt;{{cite news |title=Irish League quintet in NI squad |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8059221.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathcart made his full international debut in Northern Ireland's 1–0 win against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in Maribor on 3 September 2010. Playing out of position at left-back, due to an injury to [[Jonny Evans]], Cathcart put in a strong performance and set up the winning goal for [[Corry Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8958348.stm|title=Slovenia 0–1 Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
