'''Laurent Koscielny''' ({{IPA-fr|loʁɑ̃ kosjɛlni, lɔ-}}; {{lang-pl|Kościelny}}, {{IPA-pl|kɔˈɕtɕɛlnɨ|pron}}; born 10 September 1985) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he is club [[Captain (association football)|captain]].

Born in [[Tulle]], Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to [[En Avant Guingamp|Guingamp]] in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], he joined [[Tours FC|Tours]] for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team's star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club's promotion into [[Ligue 1]], while also being named in the [[Ligue 2]] Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt; Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a €1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing [[Defender (association football)|defender]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/88970/laurent-koscielny?cc=3436 |title=Laurent Koscielny Bio, Stats, News |publisher=ESPN |date=10 September 1985 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements and footballing potential attracted [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], ultimately moving to the [[Premier League]] side for a fee of £8.45 million the following season.

Following his arrival in England, Koscielny was regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Peter |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9777914/terry-kompany-koscielny-who-is-the-premier-leagues-best-centre-back |title=Terry, Kompany, Koscielny?

(1966–present)|nine-year trophy drought]], scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]]. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another FA Cup and the [[FA Community Shield]] twice.

Despite qualifying to represent [[Poland national football team|Poland]], Koscielny instead decided to represent [[France national football team|France]], and first appeared up for the national team against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name=kosso&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rmc.fr/edito/sport/86852/koscielny-songe-lui-aussi-a-prendre-la-nationalite-polonaise/ |title=Koscielny songe lui aussi à prendre la nationalité polonaise |date=19 August 2009 |work=RMC.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], while also leading France to the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], which they lost to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/10/portugal-v-france-euro-2016-final-live&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first international goal in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against Scotland in 2016,&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/international-friendly/53/video/2886233/friendly-koscielnys-first-france-goal |title=Friendly: Koscielny's first France goal |date=4 June 2016 |accessdate=5 June 2016 |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amassed fifty-one [[Cap (sport)|appearances]] for the national side. He retired from international football in 2018.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Koscielny was born in [[Tulle]], [[Corrèze]]. His career began in 2004 with [[EA Guingamp|Guingamp]], a team that had produced such talents as [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Florent Malouda]]. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2007, Koscielny joined [[Tours FC]], deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in  aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008–09 season, Koscielny made 34  [[Ligue 2]] appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division's best XI at the end of the season.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt;

===Lorient===
On 16 June 2009, newly promoted [[Ligue 1]] side [[FC Lorient]] signed Koscielny on a four-year contract for around €1.7&amp;nbsp;million. He established himself as a starter and played in his preferred centre-back position. Over one season at the club, he scored 3 goals in 35 appearances. On 7 March 2010 Koscielny tapped in his first Ligue 1 goal against Olympique Marseille at Stade Vélodrome in the 65th minute in a 1–1 draw. Koscielny became a fan favourite when he scored his second goal with a header deep in injury time against Montpellier in a 2–2 draw after a cross from [[Olivier Monterrubio]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He scored another against Bordeaux after 11 minutes. However, he received a red card 15 minutes later for a foul in the penalty area against his future Arsenal teammate [[Marouane Chamakh]]. Koscielny helped Lorient to finish the campaign in 7th place; its best finish in Ligue 1. An impressive season culminated in reports from French daily ''Ouest-France'' that the defender was training with the Arsenal reserves ahead of an official announcement. On 6 July 2010, Koscielny agreed personal terms with Arsenal. Arsenal's initial offer for Koscielny was believed to be in the region of £4&amp;nbsp;million, while they were then prepared to do a deal that would also involve youngster [[Francis Coquelin]] moving on loan in the opposite direction, which Lorient rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6201064,00.html |work=Sky Sports |title=Arsenal warned off Koscielny |date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer transfer window of 2010 reports began to emerge in late June that a deal had been reached to bring Koscielny to Arsenal for a reported sum of £8.45&amp;nbsp;million. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Arsenal===

====2010–11 season====
{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote= "I don't believe any French player would have refused to come and play for Arsenal. It took me four years to go from the bench of Ligue 2 to Arsenal so it is a great achievement. I have been on the crest of a wave for the last few years. But it is just the beginning; I haven't proved anything yet. Arsenal is a reference for football."  |source= &lt;small&gt;Laurent Koscielny&lt;ref name="autogeneratedcc"/&gt; &lt;/small&gt; }}
Arsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club's number 6 shirt, previously worn by [[Philippe Senderos]], who had moved to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8798237.stm |title=Arsenal sign Lorient defender Laurent Koscielny |date=7 July 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny made his debut against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]], he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1–1 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8909559.stm |title=Liverpool 1–1 Arsenal |date=15 August 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4–1 win against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8976732.stm |title=Arsenal 4–1 Bolton |first=Pranav |last=Soneji |publisher=BBC |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered [[Sébastien Squillaci]] in a 6–0 win over [[S.C. Braga|Braga]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Koscielny was praised for performances against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and made a brilliant tackle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to stop [[Aaron Lennon]] from scoring during their [[2010–11 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to [[Theo Walcott]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4–0 at [[St James' Park]]. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal's 0–1 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.

[[File:Danny Graham, Laurent Koscielny, Nathan Dyer &amp; Kieran Gibbs.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Koscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].]]

On 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3–0 win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and [[Johan Djourou]] were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2–1 turn around victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|round of 16]] match against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The match ended in a 2–1 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny's performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, [[Martin Keown]], said his performance was "impressive" and "magnificent throughout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/50534/He_really_bullied_Barcelonas_players.aspx |first=Ben |last=Moss |title=He really bullied Barcelona's players |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 February, in the last minute of the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]], Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]], which resulted in [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] striker [[Obafemi Martins]] scoring the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarra |first=Kevin |title=Obafemi Martins grabs glory as Birmingham beat Arsenal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/27/arsenal-birmingham-city-carling-cup-final |accessdate=18 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
[[File:Fernando Torres &amp; Laurent Koscielny 2.jpg|thumb|right|Koscielny and [[Fernando Torres]] in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.]]
Koscielny started the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]] alongside [[Thomas Vermaelen]] in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2–0 home loss to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal's biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8–2 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]]. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4–3 to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at [[Olympique de Marseille|Olympique Marseille]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where Arsenal won 1–0 at the [[Stade Vélodrome]], keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where the Gunners had won 2–0.

On 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal's 5–3 away win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2–1 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against [[A.C. Milan]] in a 3–0 victory in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|round of 16]] second leg. On 13 May 2012, he scored the winning goal in a 3–2 victory against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] to ensure that Arsenal finished third in the Premier League. He was voted as the team's fourth most important player by the fans in Arsenal's Player of the Season poll for his performances throughout the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/player-of-the-season-in-fourth-place-is |first=Rob |last=Kelly |title=Player of the Season – in fourth place is... |publisher=Arsenal.com |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712065025/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/player-of-the-season-in-fourth-place-is |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2012, Koscielny signed a new long term contract with Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/koscielny-agrees-new-long-term-contract |title=Koscielny agrees new long-term contract |publisher=Arsenal.com |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724104225/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/koscielny-agrees-new-long-term-contract |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/07/24/3261758/koscielny-agrees-to-new-long-term-arsenal-contract |title=Koscielny agrees to new long-term Arsenal contract |publisher=Goal.com |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/article3678701.ece |title=Koscielny agrees new deal at Arsenal |date=24 July 2012 |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal of the season was a late equaliser against champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 23 September 2012 in a match which ended 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/23/manchester-city-arsenal-match-report |title=Laurent Koscielny rescues point for Arsenal at Manchester City |work=The Guardian |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-24 |location=London |first=Daniel |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October, he scored a header from a corner in the 88th minute against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]], helping Arsenal come back from 4–0 down to eventually win the game 7–5.&lt;ref name = "Reading 301012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Ben |title=Reading 5 – 7 Arsenal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20053678 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 December 2012 |date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2013, Koscielny scored against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] at the [[Allianz Arena]] in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League#Round of 16|UEFA Champions League Last 16]]. His goal put Arsenal 2–0 ahead on the night and level at 3–3 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the [[away goals rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21681052 |title=Bayern Munich 0–2 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1–0 at St James' Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|2013–14 UEFA Champions League play-off round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/newcastle-0-arsenal-1-match-report-gunners-finish-fourth-thanks-to-laurent-koscielny-winner-8622705.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Sam |last=Wallace |title=Newcastle 0 Arsenal 1 match report: Gunners finish fourth thanks to Laurent Koscielny winner |date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
Koscielny started the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]] by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal's 3–1 Premier League opening day defeat at home to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/23644714 |title=Arsenal 1–3 Aston Villa |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=9 May 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his partnership with [[Per Mertesacker]] saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/halfterm-reports-so-who-is-making-the-grade-in-the-premier-league-so-far-9030925.html |title=Half-term reports: So who is making the grade in the Premier League so far? |date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20140509/koscielny-signs-new-long-term-contract |title=Koscielny signs new long-term contract |accessdate=9 May 2014 |work=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal's equalising goal as the team came from 2–0 down to defeat [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] 3–2 in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], winning his first piece of silverware with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27354148 |title=Arsenal 3–2 Hull |date=17 May 2014 |accessdate=18 May 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s first goal in the [[2014–15 Premier League]]. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at the Emirates Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28718788 |title=Ramsey scores late Arsenal winner |accessdate=17 August 2014 |date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://talksport.com/football/arsenal-line-v-west-brom-defender-make-first-start-seven-weeks-141128126799 |title=Arsenal line-up v West Brom: Defender to make first start in seven weeks? |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015 |work=TalkSport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal's starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory against West Bromwich Albion at [[The Hawthorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30156733 |title=West Brom 0–1 Arsenal |date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's following fixture at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30204434 |title=Arsenal 1–0 Southampton |date=3 December 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2015 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1 laurent koscielny 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Koscielny in 2015]]

On 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30670776 |title=Arsenal 3–0 Stoke |date=11 January 2015 |accessdate=26 January 2015 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2–0 at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30766356 |title=Man City 0–2 Arsenal |date=18 January 2015 |accessdate=26 January 2015 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31106369 |title=Arsenal 2–1 Leicester |accessdate=12 February 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–0 defeat of Aston Villa at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/32563518 |title=FA Cup final – FT: Arsenal 4–0 Villa |date=30 May 2015 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
Koscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0–0 draw with rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Emirates Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33955692 |title=Arsenal 0–0 Liverpool |date=24 August 2015 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34558443 |title=Arsenal 2–1 Everton |date=24 October 2015 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34623949 |title=Swansea City 0–3 Arsenal |date=31 October 2015 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play [[Gabriel Paulista]] ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains [[Santi Cazorla]] &amp; [[Mikel Arteta]]. This ended after a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at [[White Hart Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35624234 |title=Manchester United 3–2 Arsenal |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in a 3–1 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35814925 |title=Champions League: Barcelona 3–1 Arsenal (5–1 agg) |date=16 March 2016 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3–3 draw with West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35949243 |title=West Ham United 3–3 Arsenal |date=9 April 2016 |accessdate=10 April 2016 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season====
Koscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City. On 10 September, he was given the role of captain and scored a fine overhead kick to equalize for the Gunners in a game which they then won 2–1 against Southampton making him Arsenal's highest goal scoring defender in EPL history, with the landmark achieved on his 31st birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/13/laurent-koscielny-is-arsenals-highest-scoring-defender-in-premier-league-history-5814960/ |title=Arsenal's Koscielny secures legendary status with insane stat |last=Metro.co.uk |first=Mark Brus for |date=2016-04-13 |website=Metro|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscielny was involved in a controversial incident at the end of Arsenal's 1–0 win over [[Burnley FC|Burnley]], in which Koscielny and [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] were involved in a goal which appeared to be scored from an offside position after hitting Koscielny's arm. Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37465283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/10/02/burnley-vs-arsenal-premier-league-live-score/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1617/post/first-team/burnley-arsenal-match-report-&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates [[Francis Coquelin]] and [[Olivier Giroud]] signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20170112/french-trio-sign-new-long-term-contracts |title=French trio sign new long-term contracts |date=12 January 2017 |accessdate=12 January 2017 |publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4–0 away victory against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2017/01/14/31518072/koscielny-reaches-200-premier-league-appearances-for-arsenal |title=Koscielny reaches 200 Premier League appearances for Arsenal |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38539469 |title=Swansea City 0–4 Arsenal |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |publisher=BBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last day of the 2016–17 season he received red card for a tackle on [[Enner Valencia]] of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss the [[2017 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laurent Koscielny: Arsenal defender to miss FA Cup final after appeal fails |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40020494 |website=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was absent from the [[FA Cup]] final, Koscielny lifted the trophy alongside [[Per Mertesacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch Arsenal lift record 13th FA Cup |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40073630 |website=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Per Mertesacker: Arsenal hero lifts Community Shield despite gruesome head injury |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/837857/Per-Mertesacker-Arsenal-Community-Shield-head-injury-sportgalleries |website=Express |date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
On 3 May 2018, Koscielny suffered an Achilles injury during the [[UEFA Europa League]] semi-final second leg match against [[Atlético Madrid]], and was ruled out for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laurent Koscielny: Arsenal defender suffers Achilles injury in Europa League semi |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43994949 |website=BBC Sport |date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
Following the retirement of [[Per Mertesacker]], Koscielny was made captain of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unai Emery: Arsenal head coach wants five captains in his team |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44813124 |publisher=BBC |date=July 12, 2018 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.&lt;ref name=priority&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Monaghan |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2010/08/02/2052868/arsenal-defender-laurent-koscielny-has-heart-set-on-call-up |title=Arsenal Defender Laurent Koscielny Has Heart Set On Call Up To France National Team Despite Interest From Poland |date=2 August 2010 |work=goal.com |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in [[Didier Deschamps]]' squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2014: Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy not in France squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27401306 |accessdate=14 May 2014 |newspaper=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[FIFA World Cup]] debut as a substitute for the injured [[Mamadou Sakho]] in a 5–2 defeat of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the team's second group match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207 |title=Switzerland 2–5 France |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=21 June 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285420 |title=Ecuador 0–0 France |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=26 June 2014 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
