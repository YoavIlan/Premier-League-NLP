'''Aron Einar Malmquist Gunnarsson''' (born 22 April 1989) is an Icelandic professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for Welsh {{English football updater|CardiffC}} club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the [[Iceland national football team|Icelandic national team]]. He can play either as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] or a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]].

He began his career at [[Þór Akureyri]], and played one match for Dutch club [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] before joining England's [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 2008. After 133 matches and 7 goals in three seasons for them, he transferred to Cardiff City, where he was a runner-up in the [[2012 Football League Cup Final]] and played in the [[2013–14 Premier League]].

Aron plays for [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] at international level, having made his senior debut in 2008, and has earned over 80 caps for them. He has been Iceland's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] since mid-2012, captaining the team to the quarter-finals at their first major tournament, [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Akureyri]], Aron began playing football in his native Iceland on gravel pitches. During the winter months, snow and ice left football pitches unplayable and Aron instead played [[handball]], making three appearances in the Icelandic handball League at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/09/aron-gunnarsson-iceland-midfield-leader |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Iceland's midfield leader and long-throw star |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Kristján Jónsson |date=9 June 2016 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his football career with local side [[Þór Akureyri]] in 2005 and, after investment in indoor pitches by the Icelandic government, began to train all year round. At the age of seventeen, Aron moved to the Netherlands, joining the youth academy at [[AZ (football club)|AZ]].&lt;ref name="dragons"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/there-be-ice-dragons-here |title=There Be Ice Dragons Here |publisher=The Players' Tribune |author=Aron Gunnarsson |date=4 June 2018 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially struggling with homesickness, he settled in the country and made his debut for the club during the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref name="Gunnarsson, Aron Einar"/&gt;

===Coventry City===
Aron signed for English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] team [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 17 June 2008, signing a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry set to sign Gunnarsson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/7454902.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on the opening day of the Championship season against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where Coventry won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coventry City 2 – 0 Norwich City |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10269~43657,00.html |publisher=Coventry City F.C |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207185557/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10269~43657%2C00.html |archivedate=7 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first career goal on 14 February 2009 in an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Premier League]] side [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackburn 2–2 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7872196.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Coventry, Aron attracted [[Premier League]] interest leading Coventry City to offer him an improved deal on 12 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hall is offered new Coventry deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/7940294.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first league goal came against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crystal Palace 1–1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7977127.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his first season in England, Aron was voted the Coventry City Supporter's Player of the Year as well as the club's Community Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunnarsson wins Sky Blues award |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/8033160.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Aron changed his shirt number from 12 to 17, to mirror the squad number of his brother, who is a professional handball player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News: Squad numbers announced |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10269~1728846,00.html |publisher=Coventry City F.C |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314014616/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10269~1728846%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, he continued as a vital part of the Coventry midfield, throughout the season he made 42 appearances and scored one goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 1 – 1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8632725.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coventry City started the 2010–11 season strongly looking like they were pushing for play-off places. Aron opened his season's goal scoring count with a goal against newly promoted, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], despite Coventry losing 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millwall 3 – 1 Coventry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8941283.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years at Coventry, he scored his first goal at Coventry City's home ground, the [[Ricoh Arena]], against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 1 – 2 Preston |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9021245.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Aron scored his second goal in two matches against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 2 – 1 Doncaster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9031717.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was out of contract at the end of the season and on 10 December, Aron stated his desire to stay at Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson keen to sign new deal at Coventry City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/9275863.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the following week, he received his first red card of his career against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coventry 1 – 2 Norwich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9283523.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a deal for a new contract couldn't be reached between his agent and Coventry, and at the end of the season the club gave him a deadline date to agree to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Westwood, King &amp; Gunnarsson get Coventry City deadline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/9483766.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to Aron and his agent not being able to reach an agreement with Coventry, he was linked with moves away and his agent confirmed that fellow Championship outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] were favourites to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 'among favourites' to sign Iceland star Aron Gunnarsson from Coventry City |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2011/07/05/cardiff-city-among-favourites-to-sign-iceland-star-aron-gunnarsson-from-coventry-city-91466-28992897/ |newspaper=South Wales Echo |first=Terry |last=Phillips |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===
[[File:Aron Gunnarsson.jpg|thumb|200|Aron playing for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in 2012]]
On 8 July 2011, Aron agreed a three-year deal with fellow Championship team [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a free transfer, as the fifth signing for new manager [[Malky Mackay]]. Coventry were due compensation via him being under the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aron Gunnarsson joins Cardiff City on free transfer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14089640|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut on 7 August in the first match of the new season, playing the full 90 minutes in the 1–0 away win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham 0 – 1 Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14356630.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second match, Aron limped off with an ankle injury after only ten minutes against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], the injury sidelining him for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City midfielder Aron Gunnarsson sidelined for a week |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14523831.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned after the September international break, insisting his injury was behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson ready to put injury woes behind him at Cardiff City |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city-fc/2011/09/09/aron-gunnarsson-ready-to-put-injury-woes-behind-him-at-cardiff-city-91466-29389513/? |newspaper=South Wales Echo |first=Steve |last=Tucker |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October, Aron scored two goals in a 5–3 victory against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], receiving the [[man of the match]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunnar: The win was the important thing |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2490796,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C |date=22 October 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911001508/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2490796%2C00.html |archivedate=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron played the entirety of the [[2012 Football League Cup Final]], as City were beaten 3–2 on penalties after by [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff City 2–2 Liverpool: Liverpool win 3–2 on pens|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17093419|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 February 2012|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron scored Cardiff's first goal in the Premier League on 25 August 2013, against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23744629|title= Cardiff 3 Man City 2|date=25 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 he signed a new contract with the club, until the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunnarsson signs extension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32972706|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return from [[Euro 2016]], Aron was linked with a move away from the Welsh capital, with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] claimed to be interested. However, Cardiff City manager, [[Paul Trollope]], described him as "a very important player" to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City insist Aron Gunnarsson is 'very important player to us' amid Derby County and Norwich City links |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-insist-aron-gunnarsson-11764918 |work=Wales Online |first=Phil |last=Smith |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances under Trollope and his eventual replacement [[Neil Warnock]] saw him awarded the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aron-gunnarsson-big-winner-cardiff-12968468 |title=Aron Gunnarsson is the big winner in Cardiff City's 2016/17 awards as Kenneth Zohore is also honoured |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Dominic Booth |date=30 April 2017 |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Aron failed to nail down a consistent place in the starting eleven, due to a number of injuries throughout the first half of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Cardiff boss Neil Warnock hopeful of midfielder's fitness |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41595104 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his injury problems, Cardiff offered him a new contract, which was later rejected by the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aron Gunnarsson: Iceland midfielder to leave Cardiff City after rejecting deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42181533 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron returned to the side for the final run-in, where he scored the winning goal against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and ultimately helped Cardiff gain promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 2–1 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43762401 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 April 2018 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Aron signed a new one-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Confirmed: Aron Gunnarsson signs new City deal |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2018/july/aron-gunnarsson-signs-new-city-deal/ |publisher=Cardiff City Official Site |date=9 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:2014-05-30 Austria - Iceland football match, Aron Gunnarsson 0265-crop.jpg|thumb|Right|Aron playing for [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in 2012.]]
Aron made his international debut for [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 2 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aron Einar Gunnarsson |url=http://www.ksi.is/mot/motalisti/felagsmadur/?pLeikmadurNr=148732&amp;pListi=4 |publisher=[[KSÍ]] |language=Icelandic |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017234158/http://www.ksi.is/mot/motalisti/felagsmadur/?pLeikmadurNr=148732&amp;pListi=4 |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron was called up to the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2011 European Under-21 Championship]] [[Iceland national under-21 football team|Iceland]] squad, which took place in [[Denmark]]. In the first match, Iceland beat hosts [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark]] 3–1. This was followed with a 2–0 loss to [[Belarus national under-21 football team|Belarus]], where Aron was sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belarus get the better of Iceland |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season=2011/round=2000002/match=2003388/postmatch/report/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612214437/http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season%3D2011/round%3D2000002/match%3D2003388/postmatch/report/index.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=12 June 2011 |publisher=UEFA |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two losses saw Iceland go out of the tournament via a tie breaker. Aron has been a regular player in the senior side since debuting despite helping the U-21 side when they qualified for the [[UEFA Under-21 Championship]].

Aron was named as the permanent [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the national team before a friendly match against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] in August 2012 at the young age of 23, ahead of his 29th cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/sport/fotbolti/2012/08/14/aron_einar_skipadur_fyrirlidi/ |title=Aron Einar skipaður fyrirliði|publisher=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his captaincy, Iceland qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|play-off round]] of [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualification]] for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2013/10/17/world-cup-playoff-iceland-poses-problems|title=World Cup Playoff in Iceland Poses Problems|date=17 October 2013|work=Iceland Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they lost 2–0 on aggregate to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24907602|title=Croatia 2–0 Iceland|date=19 November 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2014, Aron scored his first senior international goal in Iceland's 3–0 away win against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013849/index.html|title=Iceland down Latvia to maintain winning run|date=10 October 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again in a 2–1 defeat of the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] on 12 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33116122|title=Iceland 2–1 Czech Rep.|date=12 June 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, he was sent off in the last minute of a goalless draw at [[Laugardalsvöllur]] in [[Reykjavík]] against [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], a result which put Iceland into their first major international tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stefánsson|first1=Stefán|title=Draw sends Iceland through to UEFA EURO 2016|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013998/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron captained Iceland at their first major international tournament, [[UEFA Euro 2016]] in France.
