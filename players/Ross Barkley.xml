'''Ross Barkley''' (born 5 December 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Barkley began his professional career at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2008. After [[Loan (sports)|loan]] spells at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] he became a regular in their team, playing 179 total games and scoring 27 goals for Everton. He signed for Chelsea in January 2018.

Barkley made his full international debut in 2013. He played for England at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and was selected in [[Roy Hodgson]]'s 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] but did not appear in any of England's matches. Managers and teammates have compared his style of play to those of [[Michael Ballack]], [[Paul Gascoigne]] and [[Wayne Rooney]].
