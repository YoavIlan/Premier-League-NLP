==== 2015–16 season ====
Firmino made his Liverpool debut in a pre-season friendly away to [[Swindon Town]] on 2 August,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Neil|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool striker scores in Swindon friendly|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33754238|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his league debut a week later, replacing [[Jordon Ibe]] for the final 12 minutes of a 1–0 win at [[Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafez|first1=Shamoon|title=Stoke 0-1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33750574|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, Firmino scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 4–1 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/man-city-vs-liverpool/341310|title=Manchester City 1-4 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp masterminds stunning win|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Firmino was described by Paul Little of the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' as steadily improving during his first season in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Little|first1=Paul|title=Klopp must counter cultural legacy to free Benteke potential|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/klopp-must-counter-cultural-legacy-to-free-benteke-potential-377709.html|accessdate=24 January 2016|work=Irish Examiner|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an inability to combine with centre forward [[Christian Benteke]] drew criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jurgen Klopp says Christian Benteke has Liverpool future|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/10137092/christian-benteke-does-have-a-future-at-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-insists|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=Sky Sports|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Russia-Brazil 2018 (11) (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|330x330px|Firmino is known for his creativity, link-up play, goalscoring and workrate.]]
At Hoffenheim, Firmino primarily played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{NFT player|pid=57643|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was also utilised as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], with Firmino using his speed, close control and vision wherever he is deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberto Firmino|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/first-team/player/roberto-firmino|website=liverpoolfc.com|publisher=Liverpool Football Club|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially starting as a left winger at Liverpool under [[Brendan Rodgers]], new manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] utilised Firmino more centrally, initially as a [[False 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Firmino’s excellent false nine display almost led Liverpool to victory|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/michael-cox-how-firminos-excellent-false-nine-display-almost-led-liverpool-victory|website=FourFourTwo.com|publisher=FourFourTwo|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after impressing under Klopp's pressing system, Firmino established himself as Liverpool's first choice [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]] by the [[2017–18 Liverpool F.C. season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why there's nothing false with Roberto Firmino being Liverpool's new number nine|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-firmino-champions-league-coutinho-13472096|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Doyle of the ''Liverpool Echo'' referred to him as "a true Liverpool number nine", whose "numbers are up there with [[Harry Kane]] and [[Sergio Agüero]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roberto Firmino is now a true Liverpool number nine – and his numbers are up there with Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Morata |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roberto-firmino-now-true-liverpool-13988099 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ryan Babel]], a teammate of Firmino's at Hoffenheim, described him as "A tricky player. He can dribble, shoot, he has a great shot, he can play a lot of through balls and his assists are very good", while also praising a heading ability which would not be common amongst other players of Firmino's stature. Babel also stated that Firmino had a humble mentality and no problems with attitude.&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; In addition to his technical skills, creativity, link-up play, and goalscoring, Firmino has also been praised by his managers, teammates, and pundits for his positional sense, intelligent movement, and ability to make attacking runs off the ball, which often draws opposing players out of position and creates space for his teammates.&lt;ref name="Firmino-key-Liverpool"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/10/roberto-firmino-key-liverpools-heavy-metal-style-play/|title=Why Roberto Firmino is so key to Liverpool's heavy metal style of play|work=The Telegraph|first=J.

Due to his energy and defensive work-rate off the ball,&lt;ref name="Firmino-key-Liverpool"/&gt;&lt;ref name="man who discovered Firmino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com.au/football/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/3040802/premier-league-key-players-include-eden-hazard-roberto-firmino-and-christian-eriksen |title=Eden Hazard, Roberto Firmino and Christian Eriksen: The PL's key players |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Michael Cox |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klopp has referred to Firmino as the "engine" that propels the team's relentless counter-attacking system; "If he loses the ball, he fights for it back.

==Personal life==
Firmino married Larissa Pereira in his hometown in June 2017. They have two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pôr do sol, flores e jogadores do Liverpool: Roberto Firmino se casa em Maceió|url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/al/noticia/por-do-sol-flores-e-jogadores-do-liverpool-roberto-firmino-se-casa-em-maceio.ghtml|accessdate=8 January 2018|publisher=Globo|date=20 June 2017|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firmino has been given the affectionate nickname "Bobby" by Liverpool fans and players - a [[Hypocorism|shortening]] of his first name "Roberto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/246924-firmino-i-love-my-bobby-nickname|title=Firmino: I love my 'Bobby' nickname!|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|authors=Shaw, Chris;|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Firmino was arrested for drink driving. He was fined £20,000 and had his driving licence revoked for a year when sentenced at [[Liverpool Magistrates' Court]] in February 2017.&lt;ref name=banned&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-striker-roberto-firmino-court-12538063|title=Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino fined and banned over drink driving charge: updates|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|authors=Thomas, Joe; Kay, Dan|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
