'''Morgan Fernand Gérard Schneiderlin''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔʁgan ʃnedɛʁlɛ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://forvo.com/word/morgan_schneiderlin/ |title=How to pronounce Morgan Schneiderlin |website=Forvo |accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 8 November 1989) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[defensive midfielder]] for English {{English football updater|Everton}} club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

Schneiderlin began his career with [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], before moving to England to join [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in June 2008. He made 260 appearances across all competitions in seven seasons at the club, and was in the teams which earned consecutive promotions to reach the Premier League. He joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for a potential £27&amp;nbsp;million fee in July 2015, but left for Everton in January 2017 for a fee of up to £24&amp;nbsp;million.

After representing France at all levels from [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]] onwards, Schneiderlin made his senior international debut in 2014. He was included in their squads for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Club career==
===Strasbourg===
Born in [[Obernai]], Alsace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|25256|accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderlin started playing football with his friends at the SR Zellwiller football ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://o-posts.com/news/teams/uk/morgan-schneiderlin-southamptons-tenacious-bull-terrier/ |title=Morgan Schneiderlin: Southampton's Tenacious Bull-Terrier |first=Adam |last=Gray |website=O-Posts |date=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721230538/http://o-posts.com/news/teams/uk/morgan-schneiderlin-southamptons-tenacious-bull-terrier/ |archivedate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but began his career later with the major regional club [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]'s youth ranks in 1995, after members of his family brought him to one of the club's scouting sessions when he was five years old. After 10 years moving through the youth ranks, he signed his first professional contract with the club in 2005 and debuted for the B-team later that year. In 2006, he made his professional debut with the senior side and would go on to make four more appearances for the club, before being sold following the club's relegation during the [[2007–08 Ligue 1]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/morgan-schneiderlin-le-ballon-d-alsace-185454.html |title=Morgan Schneiderlin, le ballon d'Alsace |trans-title=Morgan Schneiderlin, the Alsace Balloon |first=Régis |last=Delanoë |website=SO FOOT.com |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dna.fr/actualite/2014/06/06/morgan-schneiderlin-rappele |title=Morgan Schneiderlin rappelé! |trans-title=Morgan Schneiderlin recalled! |newspaper=Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace |location=Strasbourg |date=6 June 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/sports/football/football-retour-aux-sources-pour-l-international-alsacien-morgan-schneiderlin-1435084855 |title=Retour aux sources pour l'international alsacien Morgan Schneiderlin |trans-title=Back to the roots for Alsatian international Morgan Schneiderlin |first=Céline |last=Rousseau |publisher=France Bleu |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2019 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
Schneiderlin moved from Strasbourg to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 27 June 2008, having signed a four-year contract in a deal that could rise to €1.5&amp;nbsp;million (£1.2&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite news |date=27 June 2008 |title=Saints tie up Schneiderlin deal |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/7477504.stm |accessdate=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Southampton despite receiving an offer from [[South Coast derby|local rivals]] [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], then a [[Premier League]] team.&lt;ref name=beeb/&gt; Schneiderlin made his debut in a 2–1 defeat away to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 9 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/7540944.stm |title=Cardiff 2–1 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morgan Schneiderlin 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Schneiderlin playing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2014]]
The Frenchman scored his first goal for Southampton away against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on 13 April 2010, with the match finishing in a 5–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8605978.stm |title=Bristol Rovers 1–5 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderlin signed a new deal with Saints on 19 August 2011, to keep him at the club until the summer of 2014. On 24 September, he came off the bench to score his second goal for the club in a 1–1 draw at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He scored a 35-yard effort in a 3–0 victory at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], meaning he had scored more than one goal in a season for the first time at Southampton.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

After promotion to the Premier League, he kept his place in the side, playing the full 90 minutes of the opening game against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. On 2 September 2012, he scored a goal against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], giving his side a 2–1 lead but the club eventually fell 3–2 as [[Robin van Persie]] netted a hat-trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/267520/report |title=RVP hat-trick sinks Saints |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 September 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderlin followed this up with another home goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on 10 November, trapping a [[Rickie Lambert]] header with his chest and then placing the ball past onrushing goalkeeper [[Gerhard Tremmel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20189996 |title=Southampton 1–1 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 2013, he captained Southampton in a comeback which saw them draw 2–2 with European champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/16/chelsea-southampton-premier-league?CMP=twt_gu |title=Southampton's Lambert and Puncheon knock Chelsea out of their stride |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score his third Premier League goal in a 2–2 draw with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 2 February, helping Southampton fight back from a goal down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209221 |title=S Wigan 2–2 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2013, Schneiderlin signed a new contract extension to keep him at Southampton until the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/schneiderlin-signs-until-2017-678957.aspx |title=Schneiderlin Signs Until 2017 |publisher=Southampton F.C |date=25 February 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Schneiderlin was credited for the most tackles, interceptions and highest work rate in the Premier League, establishing himself as one of the best [[defensive midfielder]]s in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stats Zone Premier League Central Midfielder of the Year |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/statszone/archive/2013/05/31/stats-zone-premier-league-central-midfielder-of-the-year.aspx |website=FourFourTwo |publisher=Future |accessdate=15 June 2013 |date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up both the Players' Player and Fans' Player of the Year awards at Southampton's end of season awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/morgan-does-the-double-821815.aspx |title=Morgan Does the Double! |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneiderlin scored twice in a 3–1 win at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 30 August 2014, equalling his goal tally from the previous season's Premier League campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28906779 |title=West Ham 1–3 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his third goal of the season against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 13 September, curling in a late strike past goalkeeper [[Tim Krul]], as the Saints won 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29090536 |title=Southampton 4–0 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, he was sent off two minutes from the end of a 1–1 home draw against Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Southampton 1–1 Chelsea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30566736 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a knee injury against Tottenham on 25 April 2015, ruling him out for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morgan Schneiderlin: Southampton midfielder out for season |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32532932 |accessdate=30 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester United===
[[File:Young, Schneiderlin - July 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Schneiderlin (right) playing for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2015]]
After much speculation during the summer, Schneiderlin signed for Manchester United on 13 July 2015 for a fee in the region of £25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33511027 |title=Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin join Man Utd |date=13 July 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing for United, he said: "I am delighted to be a Manchester United player. Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make. I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it’s a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Jul/Manchester-United-sign-France-midfielder-Morgan-Schneiderlin.aspx |title=Manchester United sign Morgan Schneiderlin |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=13 July 2015 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2015, he made his debut four days after signing, scoring the only goal – a header – as United beat [[Club América]] at [[CenturyLink Field]] in Seattle on their pre-season tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2015/Jul/Manchester-United-vs-Club-America-match-report-17-july-2015.aspx |title=United 1 Club America 0 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=17 July 2015 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut on 8 August as the season opened with a 1–0 victory against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[Old Trafford]], being chosen by [[BBC Sport]] as the best of United's five debutants that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Magowan |first1=Alistair |title=Manchester United 1–0 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33744640 |accessdate=8 August 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored what would be his only competitive goal for the club on 17 October, opening the scoring in a 3–0 Premier League win away to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shamoon |last=Hafez |title=Everton 0–3 Manchester United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34493717 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 October 2015 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May, Schneiderlin was an unused substitute in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]] as United beat [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 2–1 at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name=2016FAC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36292265 |title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Manchester United |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his first season with 38 appearances in all competitions, scoring once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2015/Sep/appearances-and-goals-for-manchester-united-squad-2015-16.aspx |title=Manchester United squad appearances and goals 2015/16 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Froggatt |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2016/May/match-report-crystal-palace-v-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-21-may-2016.aspx |title=Crystal Palace 1 Manchester United 2 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
[[File:Morgan Schneiderlin - France v Armenia 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Schneiderlin lining up for [[France national football team|France]] in 2014]]
In November 2013, various British media outlets reported that Schneiderlin was eligible to represent England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southampton: Morgan Schneiderlin waits for France call |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24912906 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 8.1, Regulations Governing The Application of the Statutes, FIFA Statutes, Schneiderlin is only eligible to represent France at international level as he has played at various age-levels in UEFA competitions prior to gaining British citizenship.&lt;ref name=uefa/&gt;

On 13 May 2014, [[France national football team|France]] coach [[Didier Deschamps]] named Schneiderlin on the team's standby list for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/13052014-morgan-schneiderlin-world-cup-standby-1550589.aspx |title=Frenchman Schneiderlin on World Cup standby |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2014 |publisher=Southampton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later called into the full squad following the withdrawal of the injured [[Clément Grenier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France winger Franck Ribery ruled out of World Cup with injury; Grenier also out |url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/06/06/france-winger-franck-ribery-ruled-out-world-cup-with-injury-grenier-also-out.html |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June Schneiderlin made his international debut, replacing [[Karim Benzema]] for the final three minutes of an 8–0 friendly win against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] in [[Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=France 8–0 Jamaica |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/386675/gamecast.html |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=8 June 2014 |date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His debut in the World Cup came 17 days later, when he played the full 90 minutes of a 0–0 draw with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] at the [[Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha]] in Brasília; Deschamps made six changes for this final group match due to France's previous good form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ecuador 0 France 0 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285420 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=26 June 2014 |date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his only appearance at the tournament, in which France reached the quarter-finals.

Schneiderlin was not initially selected to France's squad for their hosting of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], with Leicester City's [[N'Golo Kanté]] chosen at his expense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coerts |first1=Stefan |title=Kante, Gignac make France squad for Euro 2016 as Schneiderlin misses out |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/465/france/2016/05/12/23441122/kante-gignac-make-france-squad-for-euro-2016-as-schneiderlin |accessdate=13 May 2016 |website=Goal.com |publisher=Perform Group |date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was added following an injury to [[Lassana Diarra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Euro 2016: Lassana Diarra ruled out, Morgan Schneiderlin comes in |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36422929 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 June 2016 |date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderlin did not play in any of France's seven matches as they reached the [[UEFA Euro 2016 Final|final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morgan Schneiderlin |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2017/clubs/player=103891/profile/index.html |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
