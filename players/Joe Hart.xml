'''Charles Joseph John Hart''' (born 19 April 1987) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|Burnley}} club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]]. With over 100 Premier League clean sheets, Hart holds the joint record for the most [[Premier League Golden Glove]] awards (four) and has amassed 75 international caps since his debut in 2008.

He began his career at his hometown club [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the [[Football Conference]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]]. In 2006, he moved to top-flight Manchester City, having attracted the attention of several Premier League teams. He spent time on loan at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in his first season, before spending the 2009–10 season at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Hart was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] and was voted as the [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)#Premier League|Premier League goalkeeper of the 2009–10 season]] in recognition of his performances at Birmingham. He returned to Manchester City for the 2010–11 season and won the Golden Glove for keeping the most [[clean sheets]] throughout the Premier League season. Hart replicated this feat in the 2011–12 season and was a key player during City's [[2011–12 Premier League|title-winning campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2012/May/Hart-QPR-preview |title=Hart wins Golden Glove award for Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– Manchester City FC |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Golden Glove for the third year in a row in the [[2012–13 Premier League|following season]], and earned a second Premier League title in 2014. In 2015, Hart once again won the Golden Glove award for the fourth time in five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/may/250515-sergio-aguero-and-joe-hart-seal-golden-awards-double-for-manchester-city.html |title=Aguero and Hart seal Golden Awards double for Man City |publisher=Premier League |date=25 May 2015 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526024954/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/may/250515-sergio-aguero-and-joe-hart-seal-golden-awards-double-for-manchester-city.html |archivedate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of [[Pep Guardiola]] in 2016, Hart was dropped for selection by the new manager and made only one appearance in the Champions League before moving on loan to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in successive seasons. He then signed a permanent transfer to Burnley after having being told he had no first team future with City.
 
A former regular for England at [[England national under-21 football team|Under-21 level]], Hart made his senior international debut in June 2008, and was recognised as England's first-choice goalkeeper from 2010 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City keeper Joe Hart could be England's most capped player ever, says David James |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/8511486/Manchester-City-keeper-Joe-Hart-could-be-Englands-most-capped-player-ever-says-David-James.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has gained over 70 caps and was selected in England's squads for two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and as many [[UEFA European Championship]]s.

==Early life==
Hart was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, to Charles Hart, who sold gym equipment, and his wife Louise, a nursery school teacher.&lt;ref name=Telegraphbio&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/9792712/Manchester-City-and-England-in-safe-hands-with-Joe-Hart-between-the-posts.html |title=Manchester City and England in safe hands with Joe Hart between the posts |first=Mark |last=Bailey |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Oxon Primary School, followed by [[Meole Brace School]] in Shrewsbury, where he was [[Head Boy]] in his final year.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Hart 'would love' to play for Manchester City again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/28/joe-hart-birmingham-manchester-city |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 August 2009 |location=London |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a schoolboy, he was an equally competent [[cricket]]er and briefly played for [[Shrewsbury Cricket Club|Shrewsbury CC]] in the [[Birmingham and District Premier League]] and also spent two years in [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]'s youth squads, playing alongside [[England national cricket team|England]] cricketer [[Steven Davies]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

==Club career==
===Shrewsbury Town===
While still a 15-year-old schoolboy, Hart travelled with the [[first-team]] squad of his hometown club, [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 1 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/exeter-city-v-shrewsbury-town-01-february-2003-15331 |title=Exeter City v Shrewsbury Town, 01 February 2003 |work=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=1 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a non-playing substitute on that occasion and fulfilled that role again versus [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] at [[Gay Meadow]] on 1 March 2003, still some six weeks short of his 16th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/shrewsbury-town-v-rochdale-01-march-2003-15545 |title=Shrewsbury Town v Rochdale, 01 March 2003 |work=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match yielded Shrewsbury's final victory in a season that culminated in relegation to the [[Football Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shrewsburytown-mad.co.uk/results_fixtures/2002_2003/shrewsbury_town/index.shtml |title=Shrewsbury Town's results from season 2002/2003 |work=Shrewsbury Town Mad |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the one season that Shrewsbury spent in the Conference, Hart made his senior debut on 20 April 2004, a day after his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name=debut&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14440757 |title=Goalkeeper Joe Hart signs new 5-year deal at Man City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the full 90 minutes in the match against [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend &amp; Northfleet]].&lt;ref name="Joe Hart debut"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/shrewsbury-town-fc/2016/04/20/on-this-day-joe-hart-debuts-for-shrewsbury-town/shrewsbury-town-v-gravesend-northfleet-20-4-04-debutant-goalkeeper-joe-hart |title=On this day: Joe Hart debuts at Shrewsbury |newspaper=Shropshire Star |date=20 April 2016 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he conceded three at [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/morecambe-vs-shrewsbury/48559 |title=Morecambe 3–3 Shrewsbury Town |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=24 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart did not play again until April of the following year, as [[Scott Howie]] dominated goalkeeping duties. With Shrewsbury back in [[the Football League]] (the newly renamed [[EFL League Two|League Two]]) and struggling, Hart played six matches, conceding four goals.&lt;ref name=Telegraph130111/&gt;

From the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], Hart made the step up into the first team, and became the club's first-choice goalkeeper. He played a full 46-match league season, conceding 55 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/30462/joe-hart?season=2005 |title=Joe Hart |work=ESPN FC |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite conceding more than one goal per game, Hart won plaudits for his personal performances, winning his first England under-19 cap in October 2005, as a substitute against [[Poland national under-19 football team|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keeperportal.co.uk/joe-hart-englands-number-1 |title=Joe Hart&amp;nbsp;– England's Number 1 Goalkeeper |work=Keeper Portal |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart also found admirers in the Premier League, with several top-flight scouts attending matches.&lt;ref name=Telegraph130111&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/9792712/Manchester-City-and-England-in-safe-hands-with-Joe-Hart-between-the-posts.html |title=Manchester City and England in safe hands with Joe Hart between the posts |first=Mark |last=Bailey |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2005, the ''[[Shropshire Star]]'' newspaper reported that [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] goalkeeping coach [[Chris Woods]] had been present at Town's previous league match, a 4–3 loss at Rochdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsno.co.uk/vintage/2005/12/02/everton-watch-young-keeper |title=Everton watch young Keeper |work=Nil Satis Nisi Optimum&amp;nbsp;– Everton fans forum |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Gary Peters (footballer)|Gary Peters]] said "Everton have been to watch him, but you could say the same about [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and every other team in the [[Premier League|Premiership]]."&lt;ref name="Hart 2010 World Cup"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/players/6597577/Joe-Hart-England-goalkeeper-at-World-Cup-2010.html |title=Joe Hart: England goalkeeper at World Cup 2010 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation about his future continued for the duration of the season, and with the presence of their goalkeeping coach [[Tim Flowers]] at several matches, Manchester City became the most likely of his suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9317107/Euro-2012-England-goalkeeper-Joe-Hart-can-win-over-100-caps-insists-Tim-Flower-who-spotted-talent-early.html |title=Euro 2012: England goalkeeper Joe Hart can win over 100 caps insists Tim Flower who spotted talent early |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=29 May 2016 |date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart was announced as the top League Two player for January 2006 in the PFA Fans' Player of the Month Awards, voted for by fans via the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/display.cfm?article=7790&amp;type=1 |title=PFA Fans' Player of the Month Awards for January 2006 |first=Dave |last=Smith |publisher=Professional Footballers' Association |date=7 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080459/http://www.givemefootball.com/pfa-awards/pfa-fans-player-of-the-month-awards-for-january-20 |archivedate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the PFA Awards ceremony on 23 March 2006, it was announced that Hart had been voted as League Two's best goalkeeper for 2005–06 by his fellow professionals, earning him a place in the League Two [[PFA Team of the Year]].&lt;ref name=PFA0506&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4935884.stm |title=Gerrard named player of the year |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 April 2006 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
Hart's move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] was completed as soon as Hart returned from England under-19 duty in Belgium, where a defeat to [[Serbia national under-19 football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] in the [[UEFA U-19 Championship 2006 (Elite Round)|elite round]] meant England failed to qualify for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/archived/mens-u19s/news/2006/u19s_vserbiamontenegro |title=England fail to qualify |publisher=The Football Association |date=22 May 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time that City were to pay an initial £600,000 fee for Hart, rising to £1.5&amp;nbsp;million if undisclosed clauses were achieved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goalkeeper Hart to join Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/5006544.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 May 2006 |date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but John Wardle, then City chairman, revealed in 2012 that the transfer fee was actually £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Why Manchester City fans have former Blues chief to thank for the signing of hero Joe Hart |last=Spencer |first=Peter |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/why-manchester-city-fans-have-former-blues-799798 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=6 October 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was recommended to City hierarchy by the club's goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers who believed he had great potential.&lt;ref name="Joe Hart debut"/&gt; Hart made his debut for City on 14 October 2006 after injuries ruled out [[Andreas Isaksson]] and [[Nicky Weaver]] for the [[Premier League]] match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref name="Hart Man City profile"/&gt; He kept a [[Shutout|clean sheet]] in the match, which finished goalless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Stuart |title=Easy for Warnock to make point |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/15/match.manchestercity |accessdate=12 August 2014 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007: Loans to Tranmere Rovers and Blackpool====

He came on at half time for [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]] with England 2–0 up, eventually running out 3–0 winners.&lt;ref name="Hart England debut"/&gt; However, Hart's senior England debut did not earn Shrewsbury Town the expected bonus of £500,000 from Manchester City, as negotiated as part of his transfer in 2006, because it was not a competitive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Town in Wait For Extra Hart Money |newspaper=Shropshire Star |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2008/07/01/town-in-wait-for-extra-hart-money/ |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart kept his place in the squad for a friendly against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in August, but remained unused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/17/englandfootballteam |title=Capello names Heskey in favour of Young, Crouch and Bent |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=17 August 2008 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Blackburn Rovers goalkeeper [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] withdrew from the squad for [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group 6|World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in October 2009, Hart took his place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/hart-and-cahill-receive-england-call-1798499.html |title=Hart and Cahill receive England call |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November, he was called up for a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darren Bent called up to England squad for friendly against Brazil |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/08/darren-bent-england-brazil |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 November 2009 |location=London |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not appear in either match.&lt;ref name=englandstats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englandstats.com/players.php?pid=1156 |title=Charles Joseph Hart |work=Englandstats.com |publisher=Davey Naylor |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2013, Hart saved a penalty kick and the subsequent follow-up shot from [[Ronaldinho]] in a friendly match against Brazil at Wembley Stadium.
