'''Georginio Gregion Emile Wijnaldum''' ({{IPA-nl|ɟɔrˈɟiɲoː ʋɛiˈnɑldʏm}}; born 11 November 1990) is a Dutch professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

A youth product of [[Eredivisie]] side [[Feyenoord]], Wijnaldum became the youngest player ever to represent the club when he made his debut in 2007, and went on to play 134 matches over the course of a five-year spell. Following his departure from Feyenoord, Wijnaldum spent four seasons at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] where he won the [[KNVB Cup]] in the first season and the Eredivisie in his last. He also earned the [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]] award during his time with PSV. In 2015, Wijnaldum joined Premier League side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £14.5&amp;nbsp;million, before departing following the club's relegation a year later to join Liverpool in a £23&amp;nbsp;million deal.

Wijnaldum is also a full Dutch international, having earned more than 50 caps since making his debut in 2011, and was a member of the squad which came third at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Wijnaldum was born and raised in [[Rotterdam]], [[South Holland]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know! |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/features/2011-03-02/liverpool-transfer-target-georginio-wijnaldum-10-things-you-need-know |newspaper=talksport.co.uk, [[Talksport]]|author=Sian Parry |language= |trans-title= |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was six years old, his parents, who are both of [[Afro-Surinamese]] descent, went through a divorce with the result that his mother moved to [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool transfer target Georginio Wijnaldum: 10 things you need to know!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4389/ghana/2013/05/15/3980540/im-not-a-ghanaian-boateng-was-the-name-of-my-step-father|title='I'm not a Ghanaian; Boateng was the name of my step father,' PSV's Georginio Wijnaldum&amp;nbsp;– Goal.com|date=15 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wijnaldum decided to stay in Rotterdam and moved in with his grandmother, where he lived for the remainder of his childhood.&lt;ref name="10 things you need to know about Georginio Wijnaldum"&gt;{{cite news |title=10 things you need to know about Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-spy/Liverpool-target-Georginio-Wijnaldum-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-Dutch-midfielder-plus-watch-video-of-him-in-action-article385049.html |newspaper=mirrorfootball.co.uk, [[Daily Mirror]] |language= |trans-title= |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wijnaldum's younger years, he never showed interest in football. He never played with a ball or watched football on TV. His ambition was to become a gymnast or acrobat. This changed when Wijnaldum's cousin asked him to come to [[Sparta Rotterdam]]'s opening day with him; then he was invited to the Sparta Rotterdam youth academy and his love for football started to grow slowly.&lt;ref name=kameraadjes&gt;{{cite news |title=Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/content/asp/kameraadjes/website/feyenoord.asp?speler=10010000030408 |newspaper=Kameraadjes |language=Dutch |trans-title= |date= |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908122341/http://www.feyenoord.nl/content/asp/kameraadjes/website/feyenoord.asp?speler=10010000030408 |archivedate=8 September 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wijnaldum has two younger brothers, one of whom, [[Giliano Wijnaldum]], currently plays for Sparta Rotterdam, as well as a half-brother, [[Rajiv van La Parra]], who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/spotlight-on-georginio-wijnaldum-newcastles-new-dutch-delight/|title=Spotlight on Georginio Wijnaldum: Newcastle's new Dutch delight&amp;nbsp;– Football Oranje|date=12 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wijnaldum was formerly known as Georginio Boateng, but following his mother's divorce, he took her maiden name (Wijnaldum).&lt;ref name="ad"&gt;{{cite news |title='Goed ventje' laat zich niet gek maken |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1046/Eredivisie/article/detail/344867/2008/11/07/Goed-ventje-laat-zich-niet-gek-maken.dhtml |newspaper=AD |language=Dutch |trans-title='Good boy' won't be caught with his head in the clouds |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
At age six, Wijnaldum developed himself rapidly at Sparta Rotterdam, winning two championship titles in his first two seasons. Soon [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]] showed interest in the youngster, but Wijnaldum declined all offers: "I didn't watch football on TV and I didn't know any of the first team players of Sparta or any of the top clubs. I only knew the real famous players of ''Oranje'', so the offers didn't impress me much. I had a good time at Sparta, I wanted to stay." After playing for Sparta Rotterdam for seven seasons and representing the Netherlands at various youth levels, Wijnaldum decided to accept a new Feyenoord offer. He was convinced playing for Feyenoord was better for his development as a football player and believed in Feyenoord's vision.&lt;ref name="kameraadjes"/&gt;

At Feyenoord, Wijnaldum joined a successful generation with the likes of [[Leroy Fer]] and [[Luís Pedro]]. Wijnaldum stood out as an exceptional talent. In January 2007, a few weeks after turning 16, Wijnaldum was invited to the first team's training camp in [[Belek]], Turkey, by Feyenoord manager [[Erwin Koeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Talent in Turkije (4): Georginio Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20070112Wijnaldum.aspx |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Talent in Turkey (4): Georginio Wijnaldum |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002142801/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20070112Wijnaldum.aspx |archive-date=2 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feyenoord===
[[File:Georginio Wijnaldum 001.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Wijnaldum with [[Feyenoord]] in 2007.]]
On 8 April 2007, Wijnaldum made his official debut in Feyenoord's starting line-up in the [[Eredivisie]] home match against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] (0–4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mokerslag in de Kuip: 0–4 |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000010179 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144350/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000010179 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2012 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Slam dunk in de Kuip: 0–4 |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16 and 148 days, Wijnaldum became the youngest player ever to play in Feyenoord's first team and was chosen Feyenoord's man of the match. On 2 December 2007, Wijnaldum scored his first Eredivisie goal for Feyenoord, against [[Heracles Almelo]] in a 6–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swingend en glibberend voorbij Heracles: 6–0 |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000030681 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Swinging and slipping past Heracles: 6–0 |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002434/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000030681 |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008–09 season, Wijnaldum made his official European debut. On 18 September 2008, he was named in the starting line-up in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] [[2008–09 UEFA Cup first round|home match]] against [[Kalmar FF]] (0–1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teleurstellende rentree op Europees podium |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032667 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Disappointing comeback on European stage |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308064933/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032667 |archivedate=8 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2008, he scored his first European goal for Feyenoord in the return match against Kalmar FF, which resulted in a 1–2 win and a place in the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup group stage|competition's group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feyenoord naar groepsfase UEFA Cup |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032668 |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Feyenoord to group stage UEFA Cup |date=2 October 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144409/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/datapresenter/S2/10010000000002-10010000000016/wedstrijdinfo.aspx?contentcode=matchinfo&amp;dataid=10010000032668 |archivedate=13 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2009, Wijnaldum signed a new contract at Feyenoord which would have kept him at [[De Kuip]] until summer 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feyenoord verlengt contract Wijnaldum |url=http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20090306_wijnaldum.aspx |newspaper=Feyenoord.nl |language=Dutch |trans-title=Feyenoord renews contract Wijnaldum |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813144510/http://www.feyenoord.nl/pages/newsdetail/S2/20090306_wijnaldum.aspx |archive-date=13 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2011, he helped his struggling Feyenoord to a 5–1 demolition of Groningen, scoring four goals. He scored two goals from open play in the first half and two more from the penalty spot to add his total for [[2010–11 Eredivisie|the season]] to eight goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/295507?cc=5901 Match: Feyenoord Rotterdam v FC Groningen&amp;nbsp;– Dutch Eredivisie&amp;nbsp;– ESPN FC].

===PSV===
[[File:Dinamo-PSV (7).jpg|thumb|272x272px|Wijnaldum with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in 2014.]]
On 29 June 2011, the technical director of Feyenoord announced the club had reached a transfer deal for Wijnaldum reported to be worth €5&amp;nbsp;million with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=141028 'Ik had Wijnaldum liever aan buitenlandse club verkocht']. Voetbalzone.nl. Retrieved on 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 Eredivisie season]], Wijnaldum made his debut for PSV in a 3–1 loss against [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: AZ Alkmaar vs PSV Eindhoven|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=321917&amp;cc=5739|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 August 2011, Wijnaldum scored his first goal for PSV in a 3–0 victory against [[ADO Den Haag]]. Since joining the club, Wijnaldum established himself in the starting 11 as he scored goals and developed assists from his attacking role in midfield in Eredivisie, the KNVB Cup and the UEFA Europa League. After the retirement of [[Mark van Bommel]] and the departure of [[Kevin Strootman]] in the summer of 2013, Wijnaldum was named PSV's captain for the [[2013–14 Eredivisie]] season. However, he played just 11 matches that year, scoring four goals, due to a back injury. For the [[2014–15 Eredivisie]] season, Wijnaldum returned to full fitness and captained PSV to their first Eredivisie title since [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2008]].

===Newcastle United===
On 11 July 2015, Wijnaldum joined English [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a five-year contract, for a reported transfer fee of £14.5&amp;nbsp;million, making him the most expensive signing of [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]]'s ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle United: Georginio Wijnaldum seals five-year deal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33474195|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wijnaldum made his debut on 9 August as Newcastle began the season with a 2–2 home draw against [[Southampton F.C|Southampton]], heading in a goal from [[Gabriel Obertan]]'s cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Matt|title=Newcastle 2–2 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33750572|accessdate=9 August 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would score his second Newcastle goal in a 2–2 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 26 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Olsen |first1=Connor |title=Newcastle 2–2 Chelsea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34299598 |accessdate=26 September 2015 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, Wijnaldum scored four goals in a 6–2 home win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34498802|title=Newcastle United 6–2 Norwich City|date=18 October 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming only the second Newcastle player to score more than three goals in a Premier League match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34567846|title=Steve McClaren: Boss has had 'enormous' support from Newcastle|date=18 October 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wijnaldum was considered the player of the match in a game against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] when he forced [[Martin Škrtel]] into an own goal as well as scoring himself in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.us/barclays-premier-league/match/422519/newcastle-united-liverpool/report |title=Newcastle beat Liverpool as Georginio Wijnaldum is the star of the show |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=6 December 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a 3–3 draw on 12 January 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawkes|first=Phil|title=Newcastle United 3–3 Manchester United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35229750|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again four days later in a 2–1 win against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanghera|first=Mandeep|title=Newcastle United 2–1 West Ham United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35270693|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later scored twice against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 5–1 win on the final day of the season, finishing the season as Newcastle's top goalscorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chowdhury|first=Saj|title=Newcastle United 5–1 Tottenham Hotspur|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36240333|access-date=23 July 2016|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the season, Newcastle were relegated to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].
