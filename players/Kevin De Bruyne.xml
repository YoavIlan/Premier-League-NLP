====Werder Bremen (loan)====
[[File:Kevin de bruyne werder.JPG|thumb|left|175px|De Bruyne during his spell with Werder Bremen in 2012]]
On 2 August 2012, Chelsea announced that De Bruyne was to join [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the [[Bundesliga]] on a season-long loan deal after having successfully completed a medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2182639/Kevin-Bruyne-joins-Werder-Bremen-season-long-loan.html|title=Chelsea send £7m youngster De Bruyne to Werder Bremen on season-long loan|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bruyne scored his first goal for Bremen in a 3–2 defeat to [[Hannover 96]] on 15 September, netting from 11 yards out after being played in by [[Eljero Elia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/346384/gamecast.html |title=Hannover 96 3–2 Werder Bremen |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 September 2012| accessdate = 7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/264956/report|title=Huszti is hero and villain|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 September 2012|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bruyne continued his good form, scoring in Bremen's next game, a 2–2 draw with [[VfB Stuttgart]], on 23 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/346376/gamecast.html |title=Werder Bremen 2–2 VfB Stuttgart |publisher=ESPN FC |date=23 September 2012 | accessdate = 7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/267321/report|title=Honours even at Weser Stadion|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bruyne got back on the score sheet on 18 November, scoring the winning goal — despite his team being down to 10 men — as Bremen came from a goal down to defeat [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/346299/gamecast.html |title= Werder Bremen 2–1 Fortuna Düsseldorf |publisher=ESPN FC |date=18 November 2012 | accessdate = 7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/279413/report|title=Winning start for Schaaf|publisher=Sky Sports|date=19 November 2012|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bruyne scored his first goal in over two months on 4 May 2013, since netting a consolation goal in [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]'s 6–1 hammering of Bremen, putting his side up 2–0 at home to [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] before a late brace from [[Sven Schipplock]] meant that the game finished 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/346123/gamecast.html |title=Werder Bremen 2–2 TSG Hoffenheim |publisher=ESPNFC |date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/265457/report|title=Hoffenheim fight back to draw|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with a goal in Bremen's next match, securing a place in the Bundesliga for the next season with a 1–1 draw against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] on 11 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/346110/gamecast.htm |title=Werder Bremen 1–1 Eintracht Frankfurt |publisher=ESPNFC |date=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/265466/report|title=Eagles secure a point|publisher=Sky Sports|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Chelsea====

==Style of play==
Considered to be a versatile and highly talented player in the media, De Bruyne plays mainly as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central]] or an [[attacking midfielder]] but can also operate in several other positions, and has been used as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or [[second striker]]; he has even been deployed in a deeper [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box role]]. He is often described by pundits as one of the best and most complete modern day [[Playmaker|advanced playmakers]], due to his technique, skill, athleticism, work-rate off the ball, vision, wide range of passing, and powerful long-range shooting ability with either foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squawka.com/news/do-manchester-city-need-kevin-de-bruyne-this-summer/395150|title=Do Manchester City need Kevin De Bruyne this summer?|publisher=Squawka|date=11 June 2015|access-date=16 November 2017|first=Daniel|last=Anwar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/11833859/Kevin-De-Bruyne-completes-54m-Man-City-transfer.html|title=Kevin De Bruyne completes £54m Man City transfer|work=The Daily Telegraph|author1=Mark Ogden|author2=Mike Whalley|date=30 August 2015|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/686309 |title=De Bruyne the drive behind Man City success |publisher=Premier League |author1=Adrian Clarke |date=11 May 2018 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-vs-manchester-city-kevin-de-bruyne-perfect-complete-guardiola-conte-reaction-a7976051.html |title=Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte laud Kevin De Bruyne for being the perfect 'complete' player after masterclass |publisher=The Independent |author1=Miguel Delaney |date=30 September 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/de-bruyne-s-versatility-a-key-for-belgium-1.1134678 |title=De Bruyne's versatility a key for Belgium |publisher=TSN |date=9 July 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is not blessed with significant physical strength, pace, or ability in the air,&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/3785/generazione-di-fenomeni/2011/11/16/2756464/generazione-di-fenomeni-kevin-de-bruyne-il-gioiello-del-genk-che- |title=Generazione di Fenomeni - Kevin De Bruyne, il gioiello del Genk che il Chelsea sta corteggiando da anni... |publisher=Goal.com |language=Italian |author1=Simone Gambino |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he is a quick and elegant player on the ball, with good [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, while his positional sense, tactical intelligence, movement, direct style of play, and ability to run at defences when in possession also enable him to take advantage of spaces in the opposition's defence, and subsequently create chances and goalscoring opportunities for himself or his teammates, making him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2017-2018/soccer-de-bruyne-performance-leaves-guardiola-speechless_sto6446741/story.shtml |title=Kevin De Bruyne performance leaves Pep Guardiola speechless |publisher=Eurosport |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/09/22/kevin-de-bruyne-is-one-of-best-players-ive-worked-with-says-pep/ |title=Kevin De Bruyne 'is one of best players I've worked with' says Pep Guardiola - but what makes him so special? |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=JJ Bull |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vivoperlei.calciomercato.com/articolo/dopo-messi-e-cr7-a-chi-il-pallone-doro?referral=vxl_box_mobile |title=Dopo Messi e Cr7 a chi il pallone d'Oro? |publisher=Calciomercato |language=Italian |author1=Ammiraglio Byrd |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his creative abilities,&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt; he is also capable of scoring goals by making late runs off the ball from behind into the penalty area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/it/news/14802/uefacom/2016/06/08/24370292/pogba-de-bruyne-e-i-migliori-centrocampisti-di-uefa-euro |title=Pogba, De Bruyne e i migliori centrocampisti di UEFA EURO 2016 |publisher=Goal.com |language=Italian |date=8 June 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an accurate [[Direct free kick|set-piece]] taker.&lt;ref name="Generazione di Fenomeni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/goals-assists-set-pieces-stats-172816108.html |title=Goals, assists, set-pieces - The stats that show De Bruyne is almost irreplaceable for City |publisher=Yahoo |date=15 August 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
