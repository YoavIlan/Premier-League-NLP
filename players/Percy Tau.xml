Born in South Africa, Tau began his career with [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] in the [[Premier Soccer League]]. He made his professional debut for the club on 25 February 2014 in the league against [[Orlando Pirates]]. He came on as an 85th-minute substitute for [[Domingues]] as Sundowns lost 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sundowns 0–1 Orlando Pirates|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/02/25/south-africa/psl/mamelodi-sundowns/orlando-pirates/1528923/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tau then scored his first professional goal for the club during a [[Nedbank Cup]] match on 22 March 2014 against [[Lamontville Golden Arrows F.C.|Golden Arrows]]. His 90th-minute goal was the fourth and final goal for Sundowns as they won 4–1 against the Arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Arrows 1–4 Sundowns|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/03/22/south-africa/cup/golden-arrows/mamelodi-sundowns/1654849/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored his first goal in international club competition on 5 April 2015 in a [[CAF Champions League]] match against [[TP Mazembe]].

On the advice of then-youth coach Rhulani Mokwena, he was [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[National First Division]] side [[Witbank Spurs F.C.|Witbank Spurs]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/sport/soccer/psl/how-percy-tau-went-from-slacker-to-superstar-at-mamelodi-sundowns-14785377|title=How Percy Tau went from slacker to superstar at Mamelodi Sundowns|publisher=Independent Online|last=Molefe|first=Mazola|date=4 May 2018|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 6 February 2016 in a 3–1 win over [[African Warriors F.C.|African Warriors]] and went on to score 3 goals in 11 appearances during his loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Warriors 1–3 Witbank Spurs|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/02/06/south-africa/1st-division/african-warriors/witbank-spurs/2126739/|website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a season with Witbank Spurs, Tau rejoined Mamelodi Sundowns and was included in the squad for the club's [[CAF Champions League]] campaign. He featured throughout and played every minute of both legs of a 3–1 aggregate win over Egyptian side [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] in the [[2017 CAF Champions League#Final|CAF Champions League Final]].
