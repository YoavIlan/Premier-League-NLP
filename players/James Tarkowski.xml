===Burnley===
[[File:James Tarkowski TomHeaton.jpg|thumb|upright|Tarkowski (centre) playing for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 2017]]

On 1 February 2016, Tarkowski signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Championship club Burnley for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Clarets Sign James Tarkowski |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/clarets-sign-james-tarkowski-2932970.aspx |publisher=Burnley FC |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski made his club debut on 20 February against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], entering as a substitute in the first half for [[Michael Keane (footballer, born 1993)|Michael Keane]], who was forced off with a head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/14293941.Defender_James_Tarkowski_believes_there_s_more_to_come_from_Burnley_side/ |title=Defender James Tarkowski believes there's more to come from Burnley side |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Suzanne |last=Geldard |date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski deputised for Keane for the next two games, with Burnley victorious against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14339170.Clarets_defender_Keane_praises_Tarkowski__but_is_happy_to_be_back_in_the_side/ |title=Clarets defender Keane praises Tarkowski, but is happy to be back in the side |newspaper=News Shopper |first=Suzanne |last=Geldard |date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Keane was preferred by manager [[Sean Dyche]] at right [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]] upon his return to fitness as Tarkowski was limited to one substitution appearance the rest of the season. In third position in the table at the time of Tarkowski's signing, Burnley went unbeaten the rest of the season as they won their third ever second-tier title and direct promotion to the [[2016–17 Premier League|Premier League]] on their first attempt.

Tarkowski was handed the [[Captain (association football)|captain's armband]] for Burnley's 1–0 extra-time defeat to fourth-tier [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] in the [[2016–17 EFL Cup#Second round|EFL Cup]] on 24 August, after Dyche had made 10 changes to the team that upset Liverpool four days prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37103144 |title=Accrington Stanley 1–0 Burnley (AET) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski made his Premier League debut on 27 August at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], coming on as a substitute and receiving a booking for a foul in the run-up to Chelsea's final goal in the 3–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uptheclarets.com/no-answer-to-chelsea |title=No answer to Chelsea |website=UpTheClarets |first=Tony |last=Scholes |date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to crack the preferred centre-back partnership of Keane and [[Ben Mee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/15020080._It___s_not_been_easy____Burnley_defender_James_Tarkowski_admits_life_on_bench_can_be_tough/ |title='It's not been easy' – Burnley defender James Tarkowski admits life on bench can be tough |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski received scant playing time, despite being an ever-present on the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/april/tarkowski-no-loss-of-momentum/ |title=Tarkowski: No Loss Of Momentum |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a halftime substitution on 23 April 2017 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for Mee, who left with a shin injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/burnley/379/blog/post/3110996/burnley-fall-to-deserved-defeat-vs-man-united-as-joey-barton-struggles |title=Burnley fall to deserved defeat vs Man United as Joey Barton struggles |publisher=ESPN FC |first=Jamie |last=Smith |date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening the door for his first Premier League start on 29 April against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Tarkowski endured being hit by an object thrown by a Palace fan during celebrations of [[Ashley Barnes]]' opening goal, as well as keeping [[Christian Benteke]] in his back pocket en route to a clean sheet. Manager Dyche lauded his performance as "outstanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/15259045.Sean_Dyche_hails__outstanding__James_Tarkowski_as_battle_for_places_in_Burnley_side_hots_up/ |title=Sean Dyche hails 'outstanding' James Tarkowski as battle for places in Burnley side hots up |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/burnley/379/blog/post/3118567/james-tarkowski-capable-of-filling-the-void-left-by-michael-keane-at-burnley |title=James Tarkowski capable of filling the void left by Michael Keane at Burnley |publisher=ESPN FC |first=Jamie |last=Smith |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkowski would retain his place in the team for Burnley's final four fixtures, during which Burnley ensured their participation in the [[2017–18 Premier League|next edition]].

During the summer transfer window, teammate Michael Keane departed for Everton, allowing Tarkowski to line up with Mee in the center of Burnley's defense on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/burnley-not-planning-replace-michael-10992919 |title=Burnley not planning to replace Michael Keane – because they have a ready-made successor in the building |newspaper=Daily Mirror |first=David |last=Anderson |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/10935840/michael-keane-joins-everton-from-burnley |title=Michael Keane joins Everton from Burnley |publisher=Sky Sports |first=Dev |last=Trahan |date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned the shirt number 26 initially, Tarkowski assumed the number 5 shirt vacated by Keane ahead of the season. Tarkowski's performance against Crystal Palace on 10 September was deemed Man of the Match worthy by [[Sky Sports]], as Tarkowski held Benteke and Palace without a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/15529718.Sean_Dyche_backs_defensive_work_of_James_Tarkowski_as_he_cements_Burnley_place/ |title=Sean Dyche backs defensive work of James Tarkowski as he cements Burnley place |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |first=Tyrone |last=Marshall |date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 17 clearances in the match were the most by anyone in the Premier League that season, besting a mark previously held by himself in Burnley's surprise opening day victory over Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11708/11054419/is-defending-a-dying-art-burnleys-james-tarkowski-bucks-the-trend |title=Is defending a dying art?

==International career==
Tarkowski was eligible to play for Poland through his grandfather but preferred to play for England, stating "I've always seen myself as an English person so to play for Poland would be difficult,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/11298525/england-new-boy-james-tarkowski-admits-playing-for-poland-would-have-been-difficult|title=England new-boy James Tarkowski admits playing for Poland would have been 'difficult'|first=|last=|date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/football-notebook-burnley-star-holding-out-for-england-lgf9fkbjb |title=Football Notebook: Burnley star holding out for England |first=Matt |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-bee-good-enough-play-13738531|title=Former Bee good enough to play for England – and we get more money if he does – says Brentford owner|first=Tim|last=Street|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2018, he was named in the [[England national football team|England]] squad for pre-[[2018 FIFA World Cup]] friendlies against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England call-ups for uncapped quartet as Jack Wilshere earns recall |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43344416 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2018 |accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 27 March when starting in the 1–1 draw with Italy at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 1–1 Italy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43466395 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
