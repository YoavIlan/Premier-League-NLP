Having already rejected a bid of £4&amp;nbsp;million from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] for the transfer of Antonio earlier that summer, Forest received a second bid of £4&amp;nbsp;million from arch-rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Consequently, Antonio was left out of Forest's Championship match against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 19 August 2015, with his manager [[Dougie Freedman]] citing that the winger was not "in the right frame of mind" to play.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, Antonio returned for the next league match at [[Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Antonio left out following bid from Derby, as Nottingham Forest pull out of Frey deal |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Michail-Antonio-left-following-bid-Derby/story-27633804-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820062131/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Michail-Antonio-left-following-bid-Derby/story-27633804-detail/story.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=20 August 2015 |newspaper=Nottingham Post |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=20 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] joined the bidding for Antonio, offering Forest £4&amp;nbsp;million and winger [[Matt Jarvis]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michail Antonio: West Ham bid for winger set to be rejected |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34066785 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
On 1 September 2015, Antonio signed for [[Premier League]] club West Ham United for around £7&amp;nbsp;million on a four-year contract with an option for a further two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34110297 | title=Antonio, Song, Moses and Jelavic join West Ham on deadline day | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 19 September, replacing [[Victor Moses]] in the 60th minute of West Ham's 2–1 Premier League win at Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34191909 | title=Manchester City 1–2 West Ham | publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 September 2015| accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Man of the match]] performance on 28 December 2015 in a 2–1 win, Antonio scored his first goal for West Ham. With the team losing 1–0 to Southampton, Antonio equalised when a clearance hit him and looped over Southampton goalkeeper, [[Maarten Stekelenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35148239 | title=West Ham 2–1 Southampton | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February, Antonio scored the only goal in a home win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He celebrated by lying on his side and spinning in a circle, imitating a celebration by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' character [[Homer Simpson]] in the episode "[[Last Exit to Springfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dutton|first=Tom|title=Michail Antonio celebration: Watch West Ham star perform Homer Simpson dance move after scoring|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/michail-antonio-celebration-watch-west-ham-star-perform-bizarre-dance-move-after-scoring-a3190711.html|accessdate=28 February 2016|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his next appearance, Antonio turned-in a [[Man of the match]] performance, scoring the only goal in a home win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35647651 | title=West Ham United 1–0 Tottenham Hotspur | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with another goal in a 3–2 away win at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] three days later as West Ham came from two goals down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-cant-deal-crosses-west-10997391 | title='Everton can't deal with crosses'&amp;nbsp;– West Ham scorer Antonio admits targeting Blues after watching videos of their defensive weakness |newspaper=Liverpool Echo | date=6 March 2016 | accessdate=8 March 2016 | author=O'Keefe, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Antonio signed a new, four-year contract with West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36709044|title=Michail Antonio: West Ham winger signs new four-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio started West Ham's first match of the [[2016–17 West Ham United F.C. season|2016–17 season]] in the [[right-back]] position, subsequently giving away a penalty in the early stages of the second half, which was converted by [[Eden Hazard]], to give [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] a 1–0 lead. He was substituted not long after for [[Sam Byram]]. Chelsea went on to win 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/west-ham-united/371/blog/post/2930767/michail-antonio-and-enner-valencia-flop-as-west-ham-lose-opener-to-chelsea | title=Michail Antonio and Enner Valencia flop as West Ham lose to Chelsea | publisher=ESPN FC | date=15 August 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match of the season, on 21 August 2016, Antonio returned to his favourite position of [[Midfielder#Winger|Winger]]. He scored the only goal of the match, from a cross by [[Gökhan Töre]], in a 1–0 win against Bournemouth; West Ham's first Premier League match and goal at their new ground, the [[London Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/west-ham-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report | title=West Ham's Michail Antonio is the history boy in defeat of Bournemouth |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London | date=21 August 2016 | accessdate=23 August 2016 | author=Steinberg, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, having scored nine goals for West Ham, Antonio was ruled out for the remainder of the season with what was described by manager, [[Slaven Bilic]], as a "significant injury".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham's Michail Antonio out for season with 'significant injury'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39586811|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 May 2017|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his performances during the 2016–17 season, Antonio was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]].&lt;ref name = HOTY&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonio crowned Betway Hammer of the Year | url=http://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2017/may/09-may/antonio-crowned-betway-hammer-year|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|accessdate=10 May 2017|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2017, West Ham announced that Antonio had signed a new, four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39887055|title=Michail Antonio: West Ham winger signs new four-year contract|date=11 May 2017|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In March 2016, Antonio revealed that he had rejected the opportunity to play for [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica internationally]] and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham's Michail Antonio turned down Jamaica for England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35835036|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2016|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2016, in new [[England national football team|England]] manager [[Sam Allardyce]]'s first squad, Antonio was called up for the first time, for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|2018 World Cup qualification]] match against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 where he was an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England squad named for opening 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovakia as Michail Antonio wins first call-up|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2016/aug/england-squad-slovakia-2018-fifa-world-cup-qualifier|publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2017, Antonio was called up by new England manager [[Gareth Southgate]]'s squad for the friendly match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 22 March and the 2018 World Cup qualifier against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] on 26 March, however, on 20 March, Antonio withdrew from the squad after picking up a hamstring injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michail Antonio out of England games with Germany and Lithuania|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/10808380/michail-antonio-out-of-england-games-with-germany-and-lithuania|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In February 2019, Antonio suggested that clubs whose fans engage in [[Racism in association football|racial abuse]] should be deducted points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47208847|title=Michail Antonio: Clubs should be docked points for fans' racial abuse|date=12 February 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
