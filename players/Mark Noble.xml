'''Mark James Noble''' (born 8 May 1987) is an English [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[central midfielder]] and is captain of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He has played almost all his youth and first team football for West Ham apart from two short loan spells, at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He has played for [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-16 football team|U16]], [[England national under-17 football team|U17]], [[England national under-18 football team|U18]], [[England national under-19 football team|U19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|U21]] levels. He captained the U21 side, scoring three goals in 20 appearances. Noble is the longest serving player in West Ham's current squad, having been in the first team since 2004. He is West Ham's first-choice taker for penalty kicks and has won the club's Hammer of the Year trophy twice.

In 2014, he was ranked in the top five penalty takers in the top European leagues and was in the top 10 in the world based on the percentage of penalties successfully converted since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-should-pray-penalties-world-3209514 |title=Why England should PRAY for penalties at the World Cup&amp;nbsp;— and why we should take Mark Noble&amp;nbsp;— Mirror Online |author=Richard Beech |work=mirror |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble has played more [[Premier League]] games for West Ham than any other player.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Canning Town]], East London, Noble played for Barking Colts and moved to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s academy at age 11. His father, however, who would drive him to training, could not always arrange the time to get Noble to training sessions due to the distance from their home in [[Beckton]]. Local side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] showed an interest and Noble signed as a youth player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/west-ham-hero-noble-why-i-left-arsenal-3998604#.Uw45a8LxuM8 |title=West Ham hero Noble: Why I left Arsenal |publisher=Tribal Football |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the youngest player ever to appear in their reserve team, aged 15.&lt;ref name=whufc&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Noble Profile |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/mark-noble-west-ham_2228487_29719 |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=11 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817113941/http://www.whufc.com/articles/mark-noble-west-ham_2228487_29719 |archivedate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a trainee in July 2003&lt;ref name="sbase2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=37804 |title=Soccerbase: Mark Noble |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his debut in the senior team at the age of just 17 in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in August 2004 in a 2–0 win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt; He made his league debut in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in January 2005, in a 4–2 defeat away at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt; On 30 May 2005, Noble played in the [[2005 Football League Championship play-off Final]] which saw West Ham beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 1–0 to secure a return to the [[Premier League]]. He had entered the game as an 82nd-minute substitute for [[Shaun Newton]].&lt;ref name="2005pof"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4573799.stm |title=West Ham 1–0 Preston |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|We think very highly of Mark.

Noble won the Young Hammer of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark's Big Finish |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/marks-big-finish-20050505_2236884_1138332 |publisher=whufc.com |date=5 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921085607/http://www.whufc.com/articles/marks-big-finish-20050505_2236884_1138332 |archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the runner-up to the [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer Of The Year|Hammer of the Year]] awards despite making his debut only four months previously.&lt;ref name=whufc /&gt;

Upon West Ham's return to the Premier League, he featured in only five League games in the [[2005–06 West Ham United F.C. season|2005–06 season]], including those against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 20 November 2005 and against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 27 November, but after a game against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 10 December, he found regular playing time harder to come by and was sent out on loan. He did not play for West Ham at all in 2006.&lt;ref name="sbase2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whustats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=802&amp;united=Mark_Noble |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Mark Noble |publisher=www.westhamstats.info |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan periods====
Noble was subsequently loaned to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/4674790.stm |title=Noble joins Hull for three months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made five appearances.&lt;ref name=sbase2 /&gt; His Hull debut came on 18 February 2006 in a 1–0 away defeat by [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4703636.stm |title=Cardiff 1–0 Hull |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble's loan ended early after he suffered an injury to his lower back.&lt;ref name=indie&gt;[http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article2491790.ece ''"Mark Noble: Claret and blue, through and through"''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171242/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article2491790.ece |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''The Independent on Sunday'', 17 June 2007. Retrieved 17 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble signed a three-month loan with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in August 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/4786277.stm |title=''"Noble and Walton sign for Ipswich"'' |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope of gaining necessary first-team experience. He played 13 games in the Championship and scored his first professional goal on 12 September in a 2–1 home win over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/5330028.stm |title=Ipswich 2–1 Coventry |publisher=BBC |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to West Ham===
Noble scored his first goal for West Ham against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], the side's first of three in a 3–0 home win in January 2007 in the third round of the [[FA Cup]], from an assist by [[Carlos Tevez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6214031.stm |title=West Ham 3–0 Brighton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Lyon, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March, he scored his first Premiership goal and the opening goal of the game, against Tottenham at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] in a game West Ham eventually lost 4–3 in the final seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6392467.stm |title=West Ham 3–4 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Fletcher, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Ham United v Tottenham Hotspur, 04 March 2007 |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/west-ham-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-04-march-2007-277158/ |publisher=www.11v11.com |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played 11 games in all competitions, scoring three goals in the [[2006–07 West Ham United F.C. season|2006–07 season]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;

====2007–08 season====
Noble established his place in [[Alan Curbishley]]'s side during the [[2007–08 West Ham United F.C. season|2007–08 season]], starting nearly all games when fit. He scored his first penalty for the club on 18 August 2007 in a 1–0 away win against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] after [[Colin Doyle (footballer)|Colin Doyle]] had fouled [[Craig Bellamy]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6941856.stm |title=Birmingham 0–1 West Ham United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Sanghera, Mandeep}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was out for several weeks in November 2007 after he had played through an injury for the last several months without letting the medical staff know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Naive" Noble out for two weeks |url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/archive/2007/11/09/West+Ham+%28westham%29/1822042._Naive__Noble_out_for_two_weeks/ |publisher=[[Waltham Forest Guardian]] |date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, Noble scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool from the penalty spot, after Liverpool defender [[Jamie Carragher]] had brought down [[Freddie Ljungberg]] in the last few seconds of second-half added time. His performance in the match was described as "exceptional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7210594.stm |title=West Ham United 1–0 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Chowdhury, Saj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–09 season====
The [[2008–09 West Ham United F.C. season|2008–09 season]] did not start well for Noble, as he was sent off for two bookable offences in a 3–0 loss away at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], the first away game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: Manchester City vs West Ham United |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=246349&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ENG.1 |publisher=[[ESPN|espn.com]] |date=24 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604124920/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=246349 |archivedate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving his suspension he came back to score an equaliser against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] after West Ham went a goal down with West Brom coming back to win 3–2. This was one of five goals he scored in the season with three coming from the penalty spot.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; After Alan Curbishley left in September, he remained in the first team under new manager [[Gianfranco Zola]]. He celebrated his 100th appearance for the Hammers by scoring against Blackburn at [[Ewood Park]] on 21 March 2009 to secure a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1598273,00.html Ton-up Noble earns draw]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322232131/http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C12562~1598273%2C00.html |date=22 March 2009 }}  www.whufc.com&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he signed a contract extension tying him to the club until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duo hammer out new deals |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1616190,00.html |publisher=PremierLeague.com |date=7 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411060622/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~1616190%2C00.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10 season====
Noble began the [[2009–10 West Ham United F.C. season|2009–10 season]] well, scoring West Ham's first goal of the new season, in a 2–0 win over Premier League newcomers Wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/15/premier-league-wolves-west-ham-united |title=Premier League: Wolves 0–2 West Ham United |author=Mikey Stafford |work=the Guardian |accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Gianfranco Zola, Noble established himself in central midfield in a diamond that included [[Scott Parker (footballer)|Scott Parker]] as his partner and [[Jack Collison]] and [[Valon Behrami]] on the wings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfordrecorder.co.uk/content/west_ham_united_football_club/story.aspx?brand=REConline&amp;category=hammers&amp;tBrand=RECONLINE&amp;tCategory=HAMMERSNEW&amp;itemid=WeED28%20Oct%202009%2016%3A31%3A15%3A183 Jack's a part of the precious diamond]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would only score one other goal during the season&amp;nbsp;– a penalty after [[Habib Beye]] had fouled [[Zavon Hines]]&amp;nbsp;– in a 2–1 home win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 4 November 2009.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8334228.stm |title=West Ham 2–1 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |author=Roopanarine, Les}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
With West Ham now managed by [[Avram Grant]], Noble continued to be a regular member of the first team. He played 26 of a possible 38 games in the Premier League missing a month of the season after an [[appendectomy]] as West Ham were relegated after finishing in 20th and bottom place.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-c832675194b64f0c8329bba43a451023.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043658/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-c832675194b64f0c8329bba43a451023.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=West Ham midfielder Noble out after appendectomy |agency=Associated Press |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored four league goals, all were penalties including two in one game.
