'''Tiémoué Bakayoko''' (born 17 August 1994) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He plays as a [[defensive midfielder]] due to his ability to break up play, but is considered to have all-round ability, as well as possessing physical power and athleticism, with France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] describing him as "a complete midfielder."

After suffering a broken leg as a young player, Bakayoko joined the academy at [[Rennes F.C.|Rennes]] at the age of 13. At 14, he was turned down by the [[Clairefontaine (football)|Clairfontaine]] academy. His senior career began at Rennes where he made 24 appearances before moving to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in 2014 for £7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; In his first two seasons at the club, Bakayoko made 31 Ligue 1 appearances, but was a regular starter in the [[2016–17 Ligue 1|2016–17 season]], contributing to Monaco's Ligue 1 title win as well as being named in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17 UEFA Champions League squad of the season]]. In 2017, he joined Chelsea for £40&amp;nbsp;million.

Bakayoko made his first senior international appearance for France in March 2017.

==Early life==
Bakayoko was born in Paris on 17 August 1994 and played for Paris 15sème O at the age of five.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; Aged nine, he played for CA Paris Charenton before moving to Montrogue FC 92.&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; As a young player, Bakayoko suffered a broken leg which stopped him playing football for eight months.&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt; In 2008, at the age of 13, he joined the academy at Rennes.&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holyman|first1=Ian|title=Makelele made Chelsea target Bakayoko|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/3032516/tiemoue-bakayoko-chelsea-and-manchester-united-target-influenced-by-claude-makelele-and-yaya-toure|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; At 14, he was rejected by the renowned Clairefontaine academy.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;

==Club career==
===Rennes===
Bakayoko made his debut for the [[Ligue 1]] side on 24 August 2013 in a Ligue 1 match against [[Évian Thonon Gaillard F.C.|Évian TG]], playing the whole match in a 2–1 away win.&lt;ref name="OB_2Mar2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandey|first1=Kaustubh|title=Scout Report: Tiemoue Bakayoko {{!}} Monaco's midfield engine|url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2017/03/02/scout-report-tiemoue-bakayoko-monaco/|website=Outside of the Boot|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccerway1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/08/24/france/ligue-1/football-croix-de-savoie-74/stade-rennais-fc/1479069/|title=Evian vs. Rennes – 24 August 2013 |publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monaco===
====2014–2016====
[[File:Monaco-Zenit (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Bakayoko playing for [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in 2014]]

Bakayoko joined [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in July 2014 for £7&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="AS_28Jul2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiémoué Bakayoko signs for AS Monaco on a five-year deal|url=http://www.asmonaco.com/en/article/tiemoue-bakayoko-signs-for-as-monaco-on-a-five-year-deal-65340.html|publisher=AS Monaco FC|accessdate=18 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825062311/http://www.asmonaco.com/en/article/tiemoue-bakayoko-signs-for-as-monaco-on-a-five-year-deal-65340.html|archive-date=25 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun_27June2017" /&gt; and made his debut for the club on 10 August 2014 in a [[Ligue 1]] match against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]].

|source=– Bakayoko on the advice he received from [[Claude Makelele]]&lt;ref name="Metro_17Jul2017" /&gt;}}
Following his first two seasons at Monaco, in which he made 31 Ligue 1 performances, Bakayoko decided to change his behaviour to fulfil his potential, which included moving from a luxury villa to an apartment and changing the colour of his car from pink to black.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt; Additionally, he began boxing, changed his diet and improved his strength.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt; He was helped by former France international [[Claude Makelele]], who had been appointed director of football at Monaco in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charles|first1=Andy|title=Claude Makelele named Monaco's new technical director|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11816/10122017/claude-makelele-named-monacos-new-technical-director|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how to improve his football and take care of himself off the pitch.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN_22Mar2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro_17Jul2017" /&gt; Bakayoko also sought advice from his former youth coach at Rennes, Yannick Menu.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt; As a result, and with [[Jérémy Toulalan]] and [[Mario Pašalić]] having both left the club in 2016, Bakayoko became a regular starter for Monaco, helping the club to the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season and named in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League squad of the season.&lt;ref name="FFT_24Jan2017" /&gt; It was a decisive season for Bakayoko. Not only had he established himself as an important part of Monaco's team with consistent performances, he had fewer injuries and his application during training was no longer criticised.&lt;ref name="Guardian_17Jul2017" /&gt;

During the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2016–17 UEFA Champions League round of 16-second leg match]] at the [[Stade Louis II]] on 15 March 2017, Bakayoko scored the final goal (it was his first ever [[UEFA Europa League]] or [[UEFA Champions League]] goal) with a header from a [[Thomas Lemar]] free-kick to help Monaco secure a vital goal against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Monaco won 3–1 and won the tie on the away goals rule (aggregate score 6–6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shamoon|first1=Hafez|title=Monaco 3–1 Manchester City (agg 6–6): Monaco win on away goals|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39248906|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview, Bakayoko said a recurrence of an knee injury from 2015 leading to a crack in the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] caused him a lot of discomfort during his final season at Monaco: "People don't know but throughout the whole of last season I suffered because of my knee. I really had to grit my teeth in every match."&lt;ref name="Mirror_2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeman|first1=Neil|title=Chelsea's Tiemoue Bakayoko lays bare injury woe|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelseas-tiemoue-bakayoko-lays-bare-11046017|website=Daily Mirror|accessdate=20 May 2018|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:Chelsea 4 Watford 2 (Tiémoué Bakayoko).jpg|thumb|upright|Bakayoko playing for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2017]]

On 15 July 2017, Bakayoko signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a five-year contract for a fee around the margin of £40&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bakayoko is a Blue |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/07/bakayoko-is-a-blue.html |publisher=Chelsea Official Site |date=15 July 2017 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro_17Jul2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Simon|title=Tiemoue Bakayoko confirms Chelsea legend was major influence|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/17/tiemoue-bakayoko-confirms-chelsea-legend-claude-makelele-played-major-role-in-his-development-6784766/|website=Metro|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the club's second most expensive signing at the time, after [[Fernando Torres]].&lt;ref name="Sky_17Jul2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lyall|title=Tiemoue Bakayoko seals £40m Chelsea transfer from Monaco|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10949875/tiemoue-bakayoko-completes-40m-chelsea-move-from-monaco|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=22 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Chelsea debut in a 2–1 away win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the Premier League on 20 August 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_20Aug2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Jonathan|title=Chelsea manager Antonio Conte praised the "commitment" of his team in a "moment that is not easy" as they bounced back from their opening-day loss to Burnley by beating Tottenham at Wembley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40914668|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February, he was sent off for the first time in his Chelsea career, in a 4–1 loss away to [[Watford FC|Watford]]. Bakayoko was given his marching orders for two bookable offences, one on [[Étienne Capoue]] and the other on [[Richarlison]], both in the first half.&lt;ref name="Express_6Feb2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banks|first1=Tony|title=Watford 4 – Chelsea 1: Conte on the brink, Bakayoko red card, Deeney swears at fans|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/914889/Watford-vs-Chelsea-Conte-sack-Bakayoko-red-card-Deeney-swears-fans|publisher=Daily Express|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakayoko failed to impress in his first season. He was criticised for his performances by fans and pundits alike, with games against both [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he was sent off after only 30 minutes, and a 3–0 away defeat by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on the last day of the Premier League season being singled out as two of his worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slagle |first1=Joel |url=https://www.footballparadise.com/tiemoue-bakayoko-anatomy/ |title=Tiémoué Bakayoko – The Anatomy of a Failed Signing |date=4 April 2018 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |publisher=Football Paradise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mokbel |first1=Sami |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5355275/Chelsea-fans-turn-Bakayoko-red-card-Watford.html |title='You’re f****** s***!'

Bakayoko continued his poor form into the [[2018–19 Chelsea F.C. season|2018–19 season]], finding himself culpable for [[Inter Milan]]'s equaliser in a 1–1 pre-season draw, having lost possession in midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/fixtures-results/chelsea-ratings-hudson-odoi-bakayoko-14964872 |title=Chelsea player ratings: Callum Hudson-Odoi electric but Tiemoue Bakayoko poor in Inter victory |date=28 July 2018 |accessdate=28 July 2018 |publisher=football.london}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career in Italy did not get off to a good start, and he was labelled 'confused’, ‘a disaster’, and ‘messy' after a poor performance in a [[UEFA Europa League]] game against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], in which he gifted the Greek side the opener in a 3-1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1027401/Tiemoue-Bakayoko-Chelsea-AC-Milan-Fabinho |title=Chelsea news: Italian media label Tiemoue Bakayoko ‘confused’, ‘a disaster’, and ‘messy' |last=Ward |first=Craig |publisher=The Express |date=5 October 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/06/on-loan-chelsea-midfielder-tiemoue-bakayoko-is-struggling-at-ac-milan-admits-gennaro-gattuso-8012034/ |title=On-loan Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is struggling at AC Milan, admits Gennaro Gattuso |publisher=The Metro |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his form improved dramatically late in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/gattuso-reveals-how-bakayoko-has-improved-50032|title=Gattuso reveals how Bakayoko has improved|work=Calciomercato.com {{!}} Tutte le news sul calcio in tempo reale|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
