'''Benjamin Thomas Mee''' (born 21 September 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

Starting off with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Mee only made one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match for them before being loaned out to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and Burnley, joining the latter on a permanent basis. He has made over 200 appearances for them since then. He has also featured for the England youth teams from U19 to U21 level.

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
Mee was born in [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]], Greater Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|24539|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first came to prominence for Manchester City as the captain of the City [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy#Academy|Academy]] squad which won the 2008 [[FA Youth Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2297541/FA-Youth-Cup-Manchester-City-crush-Chelsea.html |title=FA Youth Cup: Manchester City crush Chelsea |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mee recalls Youth Cup win |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Academy-news/Archive/2009/March/Mee-recalls-Youth-Cup-win |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a two-year contract that would keep him at City until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mee signs new City contract |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Club-news/Archive/2009/February/Mee-signs-new-City-contract |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mee was given his first real test of first-team experience when he was taken on City's US tour in the summer of 2010, with club manager [[Roberto Mancini]] expressing that he wanted to blood his youth players and have a chance to see what they could do at a higher level than reserve fixtures. Mee made up two appearances, against [[Portland Timbers]] and [[New York Red Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Tour: Red Bulls 2–1 City |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/American-Pre-season-tour/2010/July/US-Tour-City-v-Red-Bull |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being given number 41 shirt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City squad numbers revealed |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/Archive/2010/July/Adebayor-snaps-up-No9-shirt |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901194615/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/Archive/2010/July/Adebayor-snaps-up-No9-shirt |archivedate=1 September 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mee followed up his tour appearances with a starting line-up appearance in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 22 September 2010 in a 2–1 away loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/9010120.stm |title=West Brom – Manchester City |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Mee making his debut, [[Javan Vidal]] and [[John Guidetti]] were given their first competitive appearances for the club in a match where three of the four players in the defensive line were young [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy#Elite Development Squad|Elite Development Squad]] players and a full six of the starting line-up were aged 21 or younger and had come through the club's academy system.

===Leicester City (loan)===
On [[New Years Day]] 2011, Mee joined former Manchester City manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] side on loan for the rest of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name="Mee joins Foxes on loan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mee joins Foxes on loan |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/EDS-news/2011/January/Mee-joins-Foxes-on-loan |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing for the club, Mee would join his Manchester City's teammate [[Greg Cunningham]] at Leicester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foxes land City youngster |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6629057/ |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks yet playing them, Mee finally made his debut for Leicester City in a 4–2 win over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City 4 – 2 Millwall |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~53356,00.html |publisher=LCFC.com |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617010808/http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10274~53356%2C00.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2011, Mee provided his first professional assist for [[Miguel Vítor]] to score his first goal in the match against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] which he scored twice later in the match which Leicester City won 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scunthorpe United 0 – 3 Leicester City |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~53162,00.html |publisher=LCFC.com |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315082422/http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10274~53162%2C00.html |archivedate=15 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 2011, Mee provided another his second assist for [[Jeffrey Bruma]] to score against Watford in a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leicester City 4 – 2 Watford |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~52462,00.html |publisher=LCFC.com |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904002934/http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10274~52462%2C00.html |archivedate=4 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2012, Burnley boss Eddie Howe expressed interest in signing Mee on a permanent basis with Manchester City sanctioning a sale just days after signing former Manchester City teammate [[Kieran Trippier]] who was also on loan at the club.
