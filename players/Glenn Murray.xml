===Return to Brighton===
On 3 July 2016, Murray returned to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2016/july/murray-back-at-brighton/ |title=Murray back at Brighton |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=3 July 2016 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second debut for the Sussex side came on 6 August away to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], while his first goal in his second spell came at home to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] six days later; he scored his second in the same match as Albion won 3–0.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; Brighton repeated that scoreline at [[Falmer Stadium]] four days later against [[Rotherham United]], and Murray was again on the scoresheet.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; On 29 October, Murray scored a hat-trick against Norwich City at Falmer as the Seagulls secured a 5–0 win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2016/october/albion-v-norwich/ |title=Albion v Norwich |first=James |last=Hilsum |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=29 October 2016 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 18 November he scored his 150th career League goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/18/brighton-aston-villa-championship-match-report |title=Glenn Murray landmark league strike earns Brighton point against Aston Villa |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |agency=Press Association |date=18 November 2016 |accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2017, Murray re-signed permanently for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a deal until June 2019. He had scored 15 goals in 28 appearances while on loan to the club in the first half of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3050297/brighton-sign-glenn-murray-on-permanent-deal-from-bournemouth |title=Brighton sign Glenn Murray on permanent deal from Bournemouth |publisher=ESPN |agency=PA Sport |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed 8 more league goals in the remainder of the season, including the opening goal in a 2–1 home win against [[Wigan Athletic]] on 17 April that sealed Brighton's promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523 |title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2–1 Wigan Athletic |first=Gary |last=Smee |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2017 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly promoted Brighton made a positive start to their inaugural Premier League season, sitting in 8th place after eleven games. An unbeaten run of four games from mid-October coincided with Murray hitting a good run of form, with the striker scoring four goals in the three games preceding the November international break. His scoring run began with two against West Ham United in a 3–0 away win, and he followed it up with goals against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at home and Swansea City away, earning Brighton four points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/swansea-0-brighton-1-match-report-glenn-murray-goal-watch-replay-table-a8037831.html |title=Glenn Murray's goal-streak continues as Brighton battle past Swansea |first=Phil |last=Blanche |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=4 November 2017 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2018, Murray scored the winning goal in Brighton's 2–1 victory over arch rivals and former club Crystal Palace to eliminate them from the [[FA Cup]] at the third-round stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/08/brighton-hove-albion-crystal-palace-fa-cup-third-round-match-report |title=Glenn Murray leaves it late as Brighton knock Crystal Palace out of FA Cup |first=David |last=Hytner |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 January 2018 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
