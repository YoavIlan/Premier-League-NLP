}}
'''Jason David Ian Puncheon''' (born 18 June 1986)&lt;!-- See talk page --&gt; is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], on loan from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

Following his goal against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on his [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] debut, he has scored in all of the top four divisions of English league football, scoring for [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in [[EFL League One|League One]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and Blackpool, Southampton and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Croydon]], Greater London, Puncheon began his career with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], and moved [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|with the team]] to Milton Keynes, where the club became [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in 2004. He was released in January 2006. He moved to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in June of the same year, after brief spells with [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] and [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]].&lt;ref name="whoswho07"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hugman |first=Barry |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2007–08 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84596-246-3 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[FA Cup]] Player of the Third Round in 2007 and the following season after scoring a succession of brilliant goals (including a last minute 35-yard free kick versus Bradford) was named in the PFA Team of the Season.&lt;ref name="FAC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6271595.stm |title=Puncheon nets FA Cup player award |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plymouth Argyle===
[[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] signed Puncheon from Barnet for £250,000 in 2008. He endured an unsuccessful 18-month spell at the club, making six league appearances. He was loaned to former club MK Dons three times in two years, where he scored 11 goals in 51 appearances.

===Southampton===
On 30 January 2010, Puncheon joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] which then led to his loan deal at MK Dons to be cut short.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~1949524,00.html |title=Puncheon joins Saints |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=30 January 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201051858/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~1949524%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in a 5–1 victory over Walsall, and scored again a few days later, in a 5–0 victory over Huddersfield.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, he was a regular in the first team. However, when [[Alan Pardew]] lost his job just days after a 4–0 win away to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], Southampton hired [[Nigel Adkins]] as manager. Under Adkins, he stayed in the first team, but found himself under increasing pressure from [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] for his place. Eventually Adkins lost patience with Puncheon's erratic performances, and dropped him to the bench in favour of 17-year-old Chamberlain, who was later sold to Arsenal for a reported £15m. On 16 November 2010, Puncheon moved on an emergency loan deal to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jason To Join Lions |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2222518,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=17 November 2010 |date=16 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119000200/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~2222518%2C00.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on his first game for Millwall in their 1–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Millwall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9194875.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 December 2010 |date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2011, Puncheon scored a [[hat-trick]] in the 3–0 victory over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millwall 3–0 Crystal Palace |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9322923.stm |accessdate=1 January 2011 |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2011, Puncheon joined [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Holloway pounces for Puncheon |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12875_6715303,00.html |accessdate=31 January 2011 |date=31 January 2011 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut, scoring a goal, at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 5 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Owen |title=Everton 5–3 Blackpool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9384152.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 February 2011 |date=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 7 March at [[Bloomfield Road]]. Puncheon re-joined the Saints after Blackpool's failed attempt to fight off relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/9043848.Relegated_Puncheon_back_with_Saints/ |title=Relegated Puncheon back with Saints |newspaper=Daily Echo |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August 2011, Puncheon joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on loan until 2 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Punch Off |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2438739,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=1 September 2011 |date=1 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919222655/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10280~2438739%2C00.html |archivedate=19 September 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=QPR sign Southampton forward Jason Puncheon on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14752434.stm |accessdate=10 September 2011 |date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the Saints after his unsuccessful loan spell at QPR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nabil |last=Hassan |title=Southampton do not want to keep Jason Puncheon, says agent |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16490298 |newspaper=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 February 2012 |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 21 January 2012, he publicly criticised Executive chairman [[Nicola Cortese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Puncheon criticises Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16678939.stm |newspaper=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 January 2012 |date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However just days later, it was revealed that Puncheon had apologised to Cortese and would be available for selection in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Puncheon settles Twitter row with Southampton. chairman |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16726108.stm |newspaper=BBC Sport |accessdate=3 February 2012 |date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then started the next two matches: a 1–1 draw in the [[FA Cup]] at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Millwall vs Southampton |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10280~61469,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=3 February 2012 |date=28 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131184229/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10280~61469%2C00.html |archivedate=31 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1–1 draw in the Championship against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Southampton vs Cardiff City |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10280~59503,00.html |publisher=Southampton F.C. |accessdate=3 February 2012 |date=31 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202031405/http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10280~59503%2C00.html |archivedate=2 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season with a 30-yard volley in a league cup win at [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]. He scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton in a 4–1 home victory against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. His second came when Southampton won 3–1 away to Queens Park Rangers. He scored his third Premier League goal in the 61st minute against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] to secure Southampton a vital 1–0 victory and move them out of the relegation zone. His fourth was scored to give [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] a 2–2 draw away to the Champions of Europe [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. On 9 February 2013, he scored his fifth in [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton's]] 3–1 home win against 2011–12 champions [[Manchester City]].

On 1 March 2013, Puncheon signed a new contract with Southampton, expiring in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Puncheon signs new contract at Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21637252 |newspaper=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 March 2013 |date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 21 August 2013, Puncheon signed a one-year loan with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2013/august/palace-sign-puncheon-on-loan/ |title=Palace sign Puncheon on loan |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed a penalty as Palace lost 2–0 away to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 11 January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25600519 |title=Tottenham 2–0 Crystal Palace |first=Timothy |last=Abraham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made up for his miss by scoring the only goal of their 1–0 win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Graham |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Stoke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25693671 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 May 2014 |date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2014, Puncheon made his loan spell into a permanent move, for a fee of around £1.75m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Puncheon pens permanent deal |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/january/puncheon-pens-permanent-deal/ |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puncheon's three goals in January and a further three in back-to-back wins in April that lifted Palace away from the relegation zone, led boss Tony Pulis to issue a 'hands off' warning to other clubs interesting in signing Puncheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Puncheon is not going anywhere warns Crystal Palace boss Pulis |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/jason-puncheon-is-not-going-anywhere-warns-crystal-palace-boss-pulis-9250768.html |newspaper=London Evening Standard |accessdate=14 April 2014 |date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2014, in Palace's first match of the new season away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Puncheon took a corner which was headed in by [[Brede Hangeland]] for the first goal of the game. He was sent off for his second booking in the 89th minute, after which Arsenal scored their winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Saj |title=Arsenal 2–1 Crystal Palace |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28718788 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2015, Puncheon scored his third goal of the season and second in as many games against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a 3–2 away win. Crystal Palace had come from 2 goals down to claim victory to boost their survival hopes. Palace manager [[Alan Pardew]] heaped praise on Puncheon's performance, describing him as "the best player on the pitch by a country mile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McMath |first1=James |title=Burnley 2–3 Crystal Palace |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30758390 |accessdate=18 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 6 April 2015, Puncheon scored the winning goal for Crystal Palace against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Puncheon's goal came from a freekick which went past Manchester City's goalkeeper [[Joe Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lockerdome.com/6556955711900993/7565437722568724 |title=Jason Puncheon free kick helps Crystal Palace defeat Man City |date=6 April 2015 |website=LockerDome|access-date=3 April 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the scoring in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]] against Manchester United with a goal in the 78th minute, but Palace went on to lose the match 2–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |title=Manchester United win FA Cup as Jesse Lingard sinks Crystal Palace |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report |accessdate=4 February 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
