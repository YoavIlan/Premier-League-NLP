'''Jonathan Ronald Walters''' (born 20 September 1983) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Walters started his career at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] but failed to break into the first team and joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Again he failed to establish himself and went out on loan to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] before joining Hull permanently. He then went on to play for [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] and [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] before finally finding regular football at [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. Walters spent three years at [[Portman Road]] before joining [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for £2.75 million in August 2010. He helped Stoke reach the [[2011 FA Cup Final]] after scoring twice in the semi-final against Bolton Wanderers as Stoke won 5–0. Walters played 54 matches during the [[2011–12 Stoke City F.C. season|2011–12]] season and then played in [[UEFA Euro 2012]] with the Republic of Ireland. Walters remained a regular at Stoke under [[Tony Pulis]] and [[Mark Hughes]], scoring 62 goals in 271 appearances before joining Burnley in July 2017.

Walters scored five times for the Republic of Ireland in 2015 during their successful [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, and was acknowledged with that year's FAI Senior International Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/we-were-written-off-in-the-qualifiers-and-im-sure-it-will-be-the-same-at-the-euros-jon-walters-scoops-international-player-of-the-year-award-34557004.html|title='We were written off in the qualifiers and I’m sure it will be the same at the Euros' – Jon Walters scoops international Player of the Year award|date=20 March 2016|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==
=== Blackburn Rovers ===
Walters was born in [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]], Merseyside&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|20442|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started his career at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] having been spotted by playing for Shaftesbury under 16s in the Eastham &amp; District Junior League by Rovers' scout for Wirral and Wales, Mike O'Brien who moved quickly to sign him.

{{Quote|"He was at Shaftesbury under-16s when I first decided he had something. I had been watching him for the previous two years but his physique wasn't what it should be. But once he got to 16 you could see him developing. He was always quick. He played against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and scored three for Merseyside Schools, so I made the decision to bring him in and he scored two against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the Saturday and we signed him on the Monday. If a player is a bit special you need to make a quick decision. And it paid off because the gaffer ([[Graeme Souness]]) thinks a lot of him. But I'll never predict what he can do or if he is close to making the first team. All I will say is the lad is scoring goals for the reserves and if he continues to do that he's got a chance."|Blackburn Rovers scout Mike O'Brien on why he signed 16-year-old Jonathan Walters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wirral's footballing Rovers; Exclusive report: Youngsters from Peninsula snapped up by Blackburn's youth Academy to train as stars of future.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wirral's+footballing+Rovers%3b+Exclusive+report%3a+Youngsters+from...-a080334344|work=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He played for Blackburn's youth and reserve teams where he scored prolifically, helping the club reach the [[FA Youth Cup]] final in 2001, losing 6–3 on aggregate to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seconds for young Guns; Blackburn 3 Arsenal 1 (Agg: 3–6).|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3a+Seconds+for+young+Guns%3b+Blackburn+3+Arsenal+1+(Agg%3a+3-6).-a074910692|work=The Mirror|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his promising career with Rovers was ended due to a 'serious breach of club discipline' which was described as 'totally out of character' and saw him suspended by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackburn suspend Irish star in new club scandal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+Blackburn+suspend+Irish+star+in+new+club+scandal.-a084286468|work=The People|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bolton Wanderers ===
He then joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for a fee of £50,000 following interest from numerous clubs. He played in four Premier League games for Bolton making his professional debut as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], before signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on loan in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2858585.stm|title=Hull keep Walters|accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport | date=21 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his debut for Hull Walters scored twice in a 5–1 win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/2789929.stm|title=Carlisle 1–5 Hull |accessdate=31 October 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his loan spell at Hull, Walters returned to Bolton, where he again went out on loan, this time to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.crewealex.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10414~409455,00.html |title=Walters keen to show what he can do |accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=crewealex.net }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however he failed to make an appearance for Crewe due to a tooth infection. In the [[2003–04 Barnsley F.C. season|2003–04 season]] he joined [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on loan and played eight league games for the "Tykes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3264815.stm|title=Walters joins Tykes |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hull City ===
Walters signed for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for a second time in 2004, this time on a permanent transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~350371,00.html |title=Walters Included As Tigers Seek Victory |accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=hullcityafc.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329135210/http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10338~350371%2C00.html |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, he joined [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] on a one-month loan deal and made three appearances for the "Iron".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4224123.stm|title=Scunthorpe snap up Angus on loan|accessdate=31 October 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wrexham ===
After scoring only three goals for Hull in two seasons, Walters was sold to [[EFL League Two|League Two]] side [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/07/01/010705_hullcity_feature.shtml|title=Tigers sell striker|accessdate=18 August 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing for the cash-strapped club, Walters believed that he made the right choice moving closer to his Merseyside home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walters upbeat on Wrexham future|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4644673.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 41 matches for the "Dragons" in the [[2005–06 Wrexham F.C. season|2005–06]] season, scoring against [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]], [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] (twice) and [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrexham 2–0 Cheltenham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4211094.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrexham 4–2 Torquay|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4322342.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrexham 4–1 Mansfield|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4494624.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrexham 3–0 Stockport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4277930.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
