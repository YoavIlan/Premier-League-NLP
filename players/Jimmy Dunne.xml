'''James Dunne''' (3 September 1905&amp;nbsp;– 14 November 1949) was an Irish [[association football|footballer]] who played for, among others, [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. Dunne was also a [[dual Irish international footballers|dual internationalist]] and played for both Ireland teams: the [[Irish Free State national football team|FAI XI]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. Dunne holds the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football.

Dunne was the first Irishman to figure prominently in the [[Football League|English League]] scoring records. In the [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]] season he scored 41 league goals for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. This became a club record and remains the most league goals scored by an Irishman during a single English League season.

In the [[1931–32 in English football|1931–32]] season, he scored in 12 consecutive matches. This is the all-time record of consecutive goals scored at the elite level of English football. Dunne also scored 30 or more [[Football League First Division|First Division]] goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. He excelled at either centre forward or inside forward and was outstanding with his head. On 27 September 1930 he scored a [[hat-trick]] of headers against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. He was a fringe member of the great [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] side of the 1930s before finishing his career at [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].

Dunne died suddenly from a heart attack, at the age of 44, on 14 November 1949. His two sons, [[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1932)|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dunne (footballer born 1935)|Jimmy]], also played in the [[League of Ireland]] for [[St. Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St. Patrick's Athletic]]. Tommy also played for [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. His nephew, [[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1927)|another Tommy Dunne]], also played for Rovers and another nephew [[Christy Doyle]], played for [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

==Club career==

===Early years===
Dunne initially played junior football. However his career was put on hold during the [[Irish Civil War]] when he was interned by the [[Irish Free State]] authorities for alleged [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] sympathies. His brother, Christy, was an active Republican. He subsequently joined [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and played a number of games for the club's senior team. A scout recommended him to [[New Brighton A.F.C.|New Brighton]], then playing in the [[Football League Third Division North|English Third Division North]]. Dunne joined New Brighton in November 1925 and made an instant impact, scoring six goals in eight league games.&lt;ref name="The FAI International Story 1997"&gt;''The Boys in Green – The FAI International Story'' (1997): Sean Ryan ({{ISBN|978-1-85158-939-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NIF"&gt;[http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/11/jimmy-dunne.html Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheffield United===
Dunne soon attracted the interest of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] who signed him in February 1926 for £800. However this marked the start of another apprenticeship in the reserves. He made his first team debut in a 4–0 home win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 4 September 1926 but he struggled to hold a regular place and in his first three seasons played just eleven league games. His first goal came against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 15 October 1927. Dunne had to wait three years before he became an established member of the United team and at one stage they put him on the transfer list. It was not until the [[1929–30 in English football#First Division|1929–30]] season that Dunne became a goalscoring sensation. His first hat-trick against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in a 3–3 draw on 7 September 1929 was followed by successive four-goal hauls against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on New Year's Day (4–2) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (7–1) three days later. He scored another hat-trick against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 March. He finished the season as the club's top goalscorer with 36 goals in 39 games and his goals helped United avoid relegation on goal average.

Dunne was subsequently top goalscorer at United for four consecutive seasons between 1929 and 1933. This included scoring over 30 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] goals in three consecutive seasons between 1930 and 1933. His best season was [[1930–31 in English football|1930–31]], when he scored 41 league goals plus a further nine in other competitions; his 41-goal haul remains the record tally in the English League by an Irishman. Dunne holds the all-time record of goals scored in consecutive matches at the elite level of English football: between 24 October 1931 and 1 January 1932, he scored in 12 games in succession.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jamie Vardy to Cristiano Ronaldo: Weird &amp; wonderful goal records|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34402082|accessdate=22 November 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
Dunne's goalscoring form with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] soon attracted the interest of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. In early 1932 they offered United £10,000 for Dunne but were turned down. However, in September 1933, after United hit financial trouble, they accepted a reduced fee of £8,250. Dunne made his debut for Arsenal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 30 September 1933 in a 6–0 win, and went on to score 9 goals in 23 league games during the [[1933–34 in English football#First Division|1933–34]] season, helping Arsenal win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. However, the arrival of [[Ted Drake]] in the summer of 1934 saw Dunne lose his place in the Arsenal first team, and he would only play another 8 games over the next two seasons. Dunne was dubbed "the most expensive reserve player in English football" in the press, although his Arsenal colleagues clearly recognised his talents, with [[Cliff Bastin]] remarking he was "one of the best five centre forwards I had ever seen".&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;

===Southampton===
In July 1936 Dunne signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] where he was nicknamed "Snowy" by the fans because of his fair hair.&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alphabet of the Saints|last= Holley |first= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary|publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-9514862-3-3|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "dangerous in the air (with) a short striding run which enabled him to retain his balance in quick moves near the goal",&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt; he was the Saints' leading scorer during the [[1936–37 in English football#Second Division|1936–37]] season, scoring 14 league goals in 36 games, helping Southampton to avoid relegation to the Third Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saints – A complete record|last= Chalk|first= Gary|last2=Holley|first2= Duncan | publisher= Breedon Books|year=1987|isbn= 0-907969-22-4|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, Dunne turned down the opportunity to renew his contract at Southampton and opted to return to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt; Eighteen months after leaving the club, Dunne was given a rousing salute by Southampton dockers as he passed through the port with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] team.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ABC/&gt;

===Shamrock Rovers===
In 1937 Dunne returned to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] as player-manager and was the inspiration behind Rovers winning [[League of Ireland]] titles in 1938 and 1939. He won 9 caps during this spell at Milltown. He also helped Rovers win the [[FAI Cup]] in 1940. The reserves had won the Leinster Senior League Division 1 title that season and they were coached by Dunne whose first medal with Rovers was the Leinster Senior League Division 1.

On 31 August 1942 Rovers played [[Belfast Celtic]] in a testimonial for Dunne which ended in a 2–2 draw. Dunne went on to coach [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] between 1942 and 1947 before returning to Rovers once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/history.php www.shamrockrovers.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801163442/http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/history.php |date= 1 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfastceltic.net/archive/hoops.html www.belfastceltic.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish international==
When Dunne began his international career in 1928 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the [[Northern Ireland]] – based [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and the [[Irish Free State]] – based [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Dunne, played for both teams.

===IFA XI===
Between [[1928 British Home Championship|1928]] and 1932 Dunne made 7 appearances and scored 4 goals for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. Dunne made his debut for the IFA XI on 2 February 1928 in a 2–1 defeat against [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. He won his second cap for the IFA XI on 20 October [[1931 British Home Championship|1930]] against [[England national football team|England]] and scored in a 5–1 defeat. During 1931 he scored a further three goals for the IFA XI and as a result scored 4 goals in four consecutive appearances.&lt;ref name = "NIF"/&gt;

===FAI XI===
Between 1930 and 1939 Dunne also made 15 appearances and scored 13 goals for the [[Irish Free State national football team|FAI XI]]. He made his debut for the FAI XI on 11 May 1930 in an away game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Dunne marked his debut with a brilliant all round performance, scoring twice in a 3–1 win. He also scored on his home debut for the FAI XI on 17 March 1936 in a 1–0 win against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. In May 1936, during a European tour, he scored five goals for the FAI XI. On 3 May he scored twice in a 3–3 draw with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. On 3 May he also scored in a 4–1 defeat to a Rhineland XI and then on 9 May scored twice in a 5–1 win against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. On 10 October 1937 Dunne scored for the FAI XI in a [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup]] qualifier against [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Norway, who won the game 3–2, later complained that Dunne was ineligible, having played for the IFA XI, who were not members of [[FIFA]]. The complaint was subsequently withdraw and on 7 November, Dunne scored in the return which finished as a 3–3 draw. He scored his last goal for the FAI XI in a 3–2 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 13 November 1938 and made his final appearance against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 23 May 1939.&lt;ref name="The FAI International Story 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=246 Ireland (FAI) stats]&lt;/ref&gt;
