'''Andrew Ronald Edward Surman''' (born 20 August 1986) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]]. He spent the first five years of his career with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] where he made more than 100 appearances. He also played for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and had a spell on loan at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Surman was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa,&lt;ref name="Hugman1011" /&gt; where his parents had moved to from Britain, whilst his father worked for an insurance company. His parents returned to the city of [[Southampton]] in 1995, and he joined Tyro League club [[Hedge End]] Rangers, where he was spotted by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] club scouts and invited to join the [[Southampton F.C. Academy|Saints academy]]. He attended St. Mary's College in Bitterne and captained the football team.

===Southampton===
Surman was the youngest player ever to play for the Saints Reserves until [[Theo Walcott]] took his record. He scored on his league debut when on loan to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] during the 2004–05 season, and, when he rejoined ''the Saints'' at the beginning of the 2005–06 season, he performed well on their pre-season tour of Scotland. He then enjoyed a successful loan spell with [[AFC Bournemouth]] between August 2005 and January 2006, playing in every league match for the team, and scoring six goals. He might have figured in Southampton's [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], but was cup-tied, having played earlier in the season for Bournemouth against [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]].

Surman made his full team debut for Southampton on 25 January 2006 under new manager [[George Burley]] at home to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], and in the next league match scored his first Southampton goal in a 2–1 defeat against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. On 17 February 2007, he scored a [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] (two strikes from outside the penalty box and a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]) in the 5–2 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]].

He became a vital part of the Southampton first team over the [[2006–07 Southampton F.C. season|2006–07 season]], and was a part of their unsuccessful play-off bid, losing on penalties to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] after a 4–4 aggregate draw, where his great strike was not enough to take ''Saints'' to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Surman joined newly promoted [[Premier League]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a three-year deal, plus another year's option, for a fee worth around £1.2&amp;nbsp;million on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman swoop secured for Wolvs|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/2009/07/01/surman-swoop-secured-for-wolves/|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=Express &amp; Star|date=1 July 2009|location=Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8128420.stm|title= Midfielder Surman moves to Wolves |date=1 July 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate= 1 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090702012318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8128420.stm| archivedate= 2 July 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his move to Wolves, Surman expressed his sadness of leaving Southampton and described the club's plight as "unbelievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saints struggles sadden Surman|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11699/5410584/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 July 2009|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surman made his debut on 18 August 2009 against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], coming on for [[Greg Halford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10307~49196,00.html |title=Wigan Athletic 0–1 Wolves |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |accessdate=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824151345/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10307~49196%2C00.html |archivedate=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start on 21 November 2009 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], but struggled to hold down a first team place, making just nine appearances in total for the club.

===Norwich City===
Surman signed for newly promoted [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 22 June 2010 in a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norwich City swoop for Wolves' Andrew Surman |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/8754639.stm |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 6 August 2010 in the 3–2 defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Carrow Road]]. After an impressive start to his Norwich City career, he sustained a knee injury in training, two days before the 2–1 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 11 September 2010. He returned to action against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 20 November in a 1–1 draw. He was subbed on 60 minutes. He suffered a re-occurrence of the injury in the 4–1 victory over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] which sidelined him until February 2011. To improve his fitness, Surman played 65 minutes in the Norfolk Senior Cup match against Dereham. He made three appearances off the bench for the first team before making his first start in the 2–0 victory over Barnsley, playing the full 90 minutes. He scored his first goal for Norwich in a 3–1 win against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. On 15 April 2011, Surman scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The following week, Surman scored the opener in the 5–1 win over Ipswich at [[Portman Road]] on 21 April 2011. At the end of the season, Norwich City was promoted to the Premier League after a six-year absent.

Surman played in three out of the opening four Premier League fixtures before losing his place, with manager [[Paul Lambert]] choosing to play a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Surman as an unused substitute, before returning to the starting line-up at the end of November. On 20 December 2011, he scored the opening goal against Wolves with a header in a 2–2 draw. On 14 January 2012, he scored the opening goal against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] with a left-footed shot in a 2–1 win. On 4 February, he scored the opening goal against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] with a right-footed shot in a 2–0 win. Surman believes that making more appearances in the Premier League is making him produce the best performances of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman delights in form|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7523359/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2012, he scored the only goal in the match for Norwich in a 6–1 defeat by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norwich 1–6 Manchester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17642962 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Surman said that the defeat to Manchester City would turn things around to winning ways for Norwich by the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surman&amp;nbsp;– Loss will motivate us |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7683144/ |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Norwich survived in the Premier League, Surman signed a new three-year deal which will keep him at the club until 2015, saying, "It feels great. It's an honour for me to sign another contract at Norwich City. I've really enjoyed my time here and I'm looking forward to another three years at the club, It has been amazing. Everyone keeps talking about these last three years at the club, winning two promotions and then staying in the Premier League."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman pens Canaries deal |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7830608/Surman-pens-Canaries-deal|publisher=Sky Sports|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After starting the new season in the team, Surman was ruled out of first team action from October until the New Year after suffering a knee injury in training.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===AFC Bournemouth===
[[File:Andrew Surman 15-10-2016 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Surman playing for [[AFC Bournemouth]] in 2016]]

On 31 July 2013, Bournemouth completed the signing of Surman on a one-year loan deal. Surman played a vital role in Bournemouth's first team in the [[2013–14 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2013–14 season]], making 35 appearances for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norwich City's Andrew Surman joins Bournemouth on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23525067 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2014, he completed a permanent move to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norwich's Andrew Surman to Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29021180|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2015, Surman was part of the Bournemouth team which won the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|Championship title]] and promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref name=Champions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759|title=Charlton 0 Bournemouth 3|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 May 2015 |accessdate =3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2017, Surman was sent off for two bookable offences in a 1–1 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the second being for a push on [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] after the latter had elbowed [[Tyrone Mings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United 1 Bournemouth 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39086674|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2017, he scored his first Premier League goal for Bournemouth in 64 Premier League appearances, in a 2–1 victory against Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bournemouth 2 Brighton 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41196761|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=15 September 2017|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Although qualified to play for [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Lisa |title=Wolves: Andrew Surman back to his African roots for 2010 World Cup |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/midlands-sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/wolverhampton-wanderers-news/2009/10/11/wolves-andrew-surman-back-to-his-african-roots-for-2010-world-cup-66331-24899442/ |work=Sunday Mercury |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was selected for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 national team]] for the European Championship qualifiers away to [[Montenegro national under-21 football team|Montenegro]] on 7 September and [[Bulgaria national under-21 football team|Bulgaria]] on 11 September. In the match against Montenegro, he came on as a second-half substitute and scored the final goal in a 3–0 victory, tapping the ball home in stoppage time from a knock-down by former Saints' trainee [[Dexter Blackstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 September 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6984539.stm |title=Montenegro U21 0–3 England U21 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Surman said that he had been "approached" to see if he was interested to play for South Africa. Though he declined, he said it was a "great honour to be approached". He went on to say that he has put any international ambitions "on the back burner" as he needs to concentrate fully on club matters and his family. He explained that "it would be a lot, especially with the [[African Nations Cup]], to be travelling around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman not rushing but still considering South Africa call |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2199190/Andrew-Surman-open-South-Africa-call.html |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=6 September 2012 |date=6 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, he told the Daily Echo: "I have never ruled out playing for South Africa but my priority has always been my club football. The past two or three years have been hugely important for me. If I had gone to play international football things might not have worked out the same way. I was really honoured to be called up and it certainly was not something I turned up my nose at. I really, seriously, considered it. But I have a young family and international football is a big commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Saint Andrew Surman not ruling out playing for South Africa|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/15389452.Ex_Saint_not_ruling_out_playing_for_South_Africa/|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=Daily Echo|date=4 July 2017|location=Southampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In April 2015, Surman's wife gave birth to the couple's third child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Surman: Bournemouth star 'proud' after whirlwind week|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32285640|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 July 2017|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
