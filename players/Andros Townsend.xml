'''Andros Darryl Townsend''' (born 16 July 1991) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|CrystalP}} club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

A graduate of the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Reserves and Academy|academy]] and featuring in various England youth teams, Townsend was initially loaned out to several [[EFL League One|League One]] and then [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs alongside limited Tottenham appearances, before gaining his Premier League debut on 16 September 2012. After further limited appearances and then a half-season loan to Premier League club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], Townsend established himself as a Tottenham player for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. He subsequently fell out of favour at Tottenham, and following a short spell at Newcastle United in the 2015–16 season, he transferred to Crystal Palace in the summer of 2016.

In his senior international career, Townsend earned his first England cap on 11 October 2013, and has gone on to make thirteen appearances, scoring three goals.

==Early career==
Townsend joined the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] academy at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2456592/Andros-Townsend-dedicated-England-debut-memory-late-brother.html |title=Tragedy that drives England's new star&amp;nbsp;– Townsend dedicates Wembley heroics to memory of his brother Kurtis |author1=Higgs, Peter |author2=Miller, Alex |last-author-amp=yes |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=12 October 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, he went on loan to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/y/yeovil/7952653.stm |title=Yeovil sign teenage Tottenham duo |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090322135753/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/y/yeovil/7952653.stm| archivedate= 22 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; making his football league debut against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] alongside fellow Spurs academy player [[Jonathan Obika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7937330.stm |title=Yeovil 0–0 MK Dons |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323074638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7937330.stm| archivedate= 23 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made ten appearances and scored one goal for Yeovil as they avoided relegation.&lt;ref name=THFCResProfile&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106142845/http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/players/reserves/androstownsend.html |title=Professional Player Profiles: Andros Townsend |archivedate=6 January 2011 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/players/reserves/androstownsend.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
====Initial loans====
Townsend entered the senior Tottenham team under manager [[Harry Redknapp]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In August 2009, he went on a month's loan to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], extended at the end of the month to the end of December, after which he returned to Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808145732/http://www.leytonorient.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10439~1745442%2C00.html |url=http://www.leytonorient.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10439~1745442,00.html |title=O's take Spurs youngster on loan |date=6 August 2009 |archivedate= 8 August 2009 |publisher=Leyton Orient F.C |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-extends-loan-310809/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros extends loan |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 26 appearances for Orient, Townsend scored twice, including a "great goal" in a 3–3 draw against Yeovil, passing three opposing players with a run that began in his own half, leading the opposition manager to lament that his players had not been more ruthless and taken him down with a professional foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8207704.stm |title=Yeovil 3–3 Leyton Orient |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having not yet made his Tottenham debut, on 14 January 2010, Townsend was again taken on loan by a League One club, Milton Keynes Dons, until the end of the season, although he was recalled after just two months due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-recalled-050310/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros recalled |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nine matches for the Dons he had scored twice.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The season ended without Townsend having made his debut for Tottenham.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On 12 August 2010, Townsend signed another season-long loan, moving up to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] level with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], but this was terminated on 20 December, as Redknapp believed he had not been playing regularly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Tottenham-pull-Andros-Townsend-out-of-his-Ipswich-loan-because-of-a-lack-of-game-time-article654939.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |title=Redknapp pulls youngster out of Ipswich loan |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-loan-to-ipswich-120810/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros loan to Ipswich |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had played 16 times, scoring once.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On 9 January 2011, Townsend marked his senior Tottenham debut in a third round FA Cup tie at [[White Hart Lane]] against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], scoring the first goal and being voted [[Man of the Match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/8786154.Watford_still_hope_to_sign_Spurs__Townsend/ |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |title=Watford still hopeful of signing Tottenham winger Andros Townsend |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be his only appearance for Tottenham for the rest of the season, with two further loan spells occurring.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He joined Championship club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 20 January 2011 on loan until the end of the season, but this was terminated early, on 23 February, with Townsend having made three appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/andros-in-watford-loan-200111/ |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |title=Andros in Watford loan |accessdate=12 October 2013 |date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/9405798.stm |title=Watford's Kiernan joins Wycombe, Townsend leaves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March, Townsend again went on loan to a Championship club until the end of the season, this time [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/millwall/9417132.stm |title=Millwall sign Tottenham Hotspur winger Andros Townsend |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April he said he would be happy to stay at the club beyond his loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/millwall/8441390/Tottenham-Hotspur-winger-Andros-Townsend-keen-to-stay-at-Millwall-after-fine-display-in-victory-over-Leeds.html |title=Tottenham Hotspur winger Andros Townsend keen to stay at Millwall after fine display in victory over Leeds |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 appearances he scored twice.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====European football and further loans====
For the first half of Tottenham's [[2011–12 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Townsend was a regular in their [[2011-12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League campaign]], making six appearances in the competition, scoring his second goal for the club in their final match in the competition against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 15 December 2011, curling in a shot from outside the box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/15/tottenham-hotspur-shamrock-rovers-europa-league| title=Tottenham thrash Shamrock Rovers but exit Europa League| first=Declan |last=Warrington|newspaper=The Guardian
|location=London |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December, he signed a contract extension, making him a Tottenham player until the end of the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11675/7391922/Townsend-signs-Spurs-extension| title=Townsend signs Spurs extension| publisher=Sky Sports| date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With only one other appearance for Tottenham, in the League Cup, on 1 January 2012, Townsend joined Championship club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on loan until the end of the season, but with his agent claiming he was unhappy at the club, he switched the loan to their Championship rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107201730/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120101/tottenham-star-joins-united_2247585_2562839| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120101/tottenham-star-joins-united_2247585_2562839| title=Tottenham star joins United| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=1 January 2012 |archivedate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2622625,00.html |title=Andros wings in |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=24 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227080705/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10412~2622625%2C00.html |archivedate=27 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17157791 |title=Andros Townsend joins Birmingham on loan after leaving Leeds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Leeds, he made seven appearances, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, and scored one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108054655/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120104/leeds-decision-was-no-brainer-for-andros_2247585_2565206| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120104/leeds-decision-was-no-brainer-for-andros_2247585_2565206| title=Leeds decision was 'no brainer' for Andros| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=4 January 2012 |archivedate=8 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.leedsunited.com/match-report/match/1120008| title=Luc's late, late winner for Leeds!| publisher=Leeds United F.C| date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Birmingham, he made 16 league appearances, including in their second leg tie in the [[2012 Football League play-offs|unsuccessful Championship promotion playoff]] against Blackpool.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Premier League debut====
Townsend remained with Tottenham for the first half of their [[2012–13 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2012–13 season]], with the club now under a new manager, [[André Villas-Boas]], who replaced Redknapp in the summer. He made his Premier League debut with a late substitution appearance on 16 September.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Although appearing a further four times in the Premier League, these were all still late substitute appearances.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Outside the league he made a further five appearances, once in the League Cup and FA Cup respectively, and three times in the Europa League.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored his third Tottenham goal in the League Cup, a fine individual effort in a 3–0 victory against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/26/tottenham-hotspur-carlisle |title=Tottenham's understudies excel in audition and outclass bold Carlisle |first=Louise |last=Taylor |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Queens Park Rangers====
On 31 January 2013, Townsend followed Redknapp to Premier League club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a loan deal until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21285005 |title=Jermaine Jenas completes move from Tottenham to QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made twelve appearances for the club, including a Man of the Match performance on his debut, scoring two goals in March, a dipping volley from outside the penalty area in a 3–1 win at home to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and an equalising deflection in a 3–2 away loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/9842206/QPR-v-Norwich-City-live.html |title=QPR v Norwich City: live |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2 February 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21639329 |title=QPR 3–1 Sunderland |author=Sanghera, Mandeep |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21724358 |title=Aston Villa 3–2 QPR | last = Monaghan | first = Matt |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; QPR were ultimately relegated, and Townsend returned to his parent club.

Now back at Tottenham, Townsend started the second Premier League match of their [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2013–14 season]], and went on to make a total of 33 appearances, including 25 in the league.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored twice, in a 5–0 away victory over [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in the Europa League (his first match of the season), and his first in the Premier League in a 2–0 victory away to Aston Villa on 20 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23707596 |title=Dinamo Tbilisi 0–5 Tottenham | last = Magowan | first = Alistair |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24510366 | title = Aston Villa 0–2 Tottenham | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 20 October 2013 | accessdate = 9 November 2013 | first = Phil | last = McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the season, Townsend came under the management of his third Tottenham boss, after Villas-Boas was replaced by [[Tim Sherwood]].

With Sherwood's contract terminated at the end of the season, Townsend started the club's [[2014–15 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2014–15 season]] under new manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]]. He made a total of 35 appearances, scoring 5 goals, but was reduced to just 17 appearances in the league, having been unable to hold down a starting place until the second half of the season.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news |title=Merson tells Andros Townsend to 'win some medals' as Twitter fallout rolls on|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/2376873/paul-merson-tells-andros-townsend-to-win-some-medals-as-twitter-fallout-continues |publisher=ESPN |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started as Tottenham lost 2–0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 1 March.&lt;ref name=2015LC&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Chelsea 2–0 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31572594 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Out of favour====
On 4 November 2015, having not started a league match of the [[2015–16 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2015–16 season]], Townsend was dropped from the squad following a touchline argument with the club's fitness coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34725197 | title = Spurs drop Andros Townsend after row with coach Nathan Gardiner | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 4 November 2015 | accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having apologised, Pochettino allowed Townsend to return to the squad by 17 November, and stated the matter was over and he was available for selection again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='We feel sorry for him' Pochettino's injury set-back ahead of West Ham |url=http://www.london24.com/sport/football/clubs/tottenham/we_feel_sorry_for_him_pochettino_s_injury_set_back_ahead_of_west_ham_1_4319706 |work=London 24 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202180057/http://www.london24.com/sport/football/clubs/tottenham/we_feel_sorry_for_him_pochettino_s_injury_set_back_ahead_of_west_ham_1_4319706 |archivedate=2 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He never made a first team appearance for Tottenham following the incident, being an unused substitute three times, the last time on 10 December.&lt;ref name=newcastle&gt;{{Cite news|title = Andros Townsend completes £12m Newcastle move from Tottenham|url = http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/10145700/andros-townsend-completes-newcastle-medical-ahead-of-16312m-move-from-tottenham|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
[[File:Townsend 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Townsend playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2016]]

On 26 January 2016, having still not started a league match, Tottenham agreed a transfer fee with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for Townsend, reportedly £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35409021 | title = Andros Townsend: Newcastle agree fee with Tottenham | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 26 January 2016 | accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fee had been announced, Townsend had already tweeted a goodbye message, and stated "As soon as I knew of Newcastle's interest they were the only club I wanted to join...Two of the best positions you can play in football are centre-forward and left wing at Newcastle. I've got the chance. I could never turn that down. I can't wait to play my first game at [[St James' Park]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Townsend to Newcastle: 'They were the only club I wanted to join'|url = https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/andros-townsend-to-newcastle-they-were-the-only-club-i-wanted-to-join-says-departing-tottenham-a3165371.html|newspaper=London Evening Standard|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was confirmed the following day, a five-and-a-half-year contract but with the club declining to disclose the fee. On signing, his new manager, Newcastle head coach [[Steve McClaren]], said of Townsend that he is a "winger with an old-fashioned style. He can play on the right or the left, is two-footed, quick, very direct and loves taking on defenders and crossing the ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Newcastle sign Andros Townsend|url = http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160127/newcastle-sign-andros-townsend_2281670_5304402|publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sky Sports, the transfer had been under negotiation for a week and Newcastle had initially wanted Townsend on loan, and then had a transfer offer of £10.5m rejected.&lt;ref name=newcastle/&gt;

Despite his debut for Newcastle being in a disappointing team performance in an away defeat, at the next match, his home debut, he was given a standing ovation after a Man of the Match performance which saw Newcastle climb out of the relegation places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Everton 3–0 Newcastle United|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35416325|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 6 February 2016|first = Patrick Jennings BBC|last = Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Newcastle United 1–0 West Bromwich Albion|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35447662|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 6 February 2016|first = Saj Chowdhury BBC|last = Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for the club came in his third match, a shot from just outside the area, but it was just a 90th minute consolation goal in a 5–1 away defeat to Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Chelsea 5–1 Newcastle United|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35510139|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate = 13 February 2016|first = Chris|last = Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
[[File:Andros Townsend 16-07-2016 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Townsend playing for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2016]]

On 1 July 2016, Townsend joined Premier League club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a five-year contract from Newcastle following their relegation to the Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36680273 |title=Crystal Palace sign Andros Townsend and Steve Mandanda |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palace triggered his £13&amp;nbsp;million release clause just six months after he joined from Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12691/10329590/andros-townsend-set-for-crystal-palace-medical-after-16313m-newcastle-release-clause-triggered |title=Andros Townsend set for Crystal Palace medical after £13m Newcastle release clause triggered |publisher=Sky Sports |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally assigned the number 17 shirt for his first season with Palace, however after Bolasie left for Everton, it was announced that Townsend had been reassigned the vacant number 10 shirt previously worn by Bolasie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/august/townsend-changes-shirt-number/ | title=Townsend Changes Shirt Number | publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. | date=19 August 2016 | accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role within the loan system==
Having had nine loan spells, Townsend's career path to regular first team football for Tottenham is often discussed in the context of a wider debate in English football about the best way to develop young talent, contrasting the loan route with Premier League players being developed in Under-21 leagues, or being brought to the Premier League level via transfers from lower league clubs. According to his father, the loan spells were the making of his son's career, while Tottenham's former Director of Football [[Damien Comolli]] who was dismissed in October 2008 believes Townsend succeeded in spite of the way Tottenham handled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |title=Premier League: Is the loan system being abused by clubs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34125476 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Harry Kane: Rise of Tottenham striker shows loaning out is increasingly the way to develop young players - Glenn Moore|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/glenn-moore-rise-of-kane-shows-loaning-out-is-increasingly-the-way-to-develop-young-players-10124360.html|newspaper=The Independent |location=London|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Youth levels===
Townsend represented England at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19 level]]. He played three times for the under-16s between 2006 and 2007, making his debut in a 1–1 draw away with [[Wales national under-16 football team|Wales]] on 20 October 2006 and his last appearance in a 2–0 away loss to [[Germany national under-16 football team|Germany]] in April 2007.&lt;ref name=TheFAprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Players/T/Andros-Townsend |title=Andros Townsend |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice on his under-17 debut, in a 6–1 win over [[Northern Ireland national under-17 football team|Northern Ireland]] in August 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/08/England17_vNIReport.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080312021738/http://www.thefa.com/England/U17s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/08/England17_vNIReport.htm |dead-url=yes |archivedate=12 March 2008 |title=Noel's boys hit six |author=Hunt, Ben |publisher=The Football Association |date=29 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make six appearances, the last in a 0–0 draw with [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal]] on 5 February 2008.&lt;ref name=TheFAprofile/&gt;

Townsend received his first call up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] in October 2012 for the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs|Euro 2013 play-off]] matches against [[Serbia national under-21 football team|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/2012/under-21s-squad-v-serbia.aspx |title=Sterling selected for U21s |publisher=The Football Association |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the first leg as a 65th-minute substitute for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2012/england-v-serbia |title=Craig gives England the edge |author=Bradbury, Jamie |publisher=The Football Association |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Townsend was charged by [[The Football Association]] over alleged breaches of its rules on betting. He subsequently voluntarily withdrew from England's squad for the upcoming European Under-21 Championship finals.&lt;ref name=BBC22658711&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22658711 |title=Andros Townsend: Spurs midfielder fined over betting |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted to charges under the FA's rules for breaching football betting regulations. After a personal hearing, he was fined £18,000 and suspended for four months backdated to 23 May 2013, with three months suspended until 1 July 2016.&lt;ref name=BBC22658711/&gt;

===Senior team===
Townsend's first call-up to the senior [[England national football team|England squad]] came in September 2013, for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&amp;nbsp;– UEFA Group H|World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andros Townsend and Ross Barkley in England squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23853555|accessdate=27 August 2013|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut in the starting eleven against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] in the World Cup qualifier on 11 October, aged 22 years 87 days. He was involved in England's first goal in a 4–1 win, scored the third with a "low swerving finish" from outside the penalty area after 78 minutes, two minutes before being substituted, and was named man of the match.&lt;ref name="England 4–1 Montenegro"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 4–1 Montenegro |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24393746 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a second cap in the World Cup qualifier against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], a playing almost all of the 2–0 home win, on 15 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=925|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further appearances came in the November friendlies, a 57th minute sub appearance in the 2–0 home defeat to [[Chile national football team|Chile]], and a full match in the 1–0 loss to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=926|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=927|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fifth cap came as a very late substitute in a March 2014 friendly, a 1–0 home win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=928|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second England goal came in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign in a 5–0 win over [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] on 9 October 2014, as he came on for the final third of the match.&lt;ref name="England 5–0 San Marino"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29454223 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next appearance marked his third England goal; on 31 March 2015 he scored the equaliser in the 79th minute against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], having come on as a 70th minute sub in a friendly match which ended 1–1.&lt;ref name="Italy 1–1 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Italy 1–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32028730 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20-yard strike was described as a "sweet right-foot drive into the bottom corner"; Townsend took to Twitter immediately after the match to respond to [[Paul Merson]] after he had said Townsend's club form did not justify him being anywhere near the England team.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; His eighth and ninth caps came in June 2015, first as a 66th minute sub in the 0–0 away draw to [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] in a friendly on 7 June 2015, before playing for the first two-thirds of a 3–2 away win over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] on 14 June 2015 in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=943|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=944|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenth cap was in another Euro 2016 qualifier, this time as a 73rd minute sub in the 3–0 away win over [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = englandstats.com {{!}} A Complete Database of England Internationals Since 1872|url = http://englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=948|publisher=Englandstats.com|accessdate = 26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Townsend was born in [[Leytonstone]], London.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt; He is of paternal [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] and maternal [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Greek Cypriot selected for the full England squad for world cup qualifiers|url=http://www.parikiaki.com/2013/08/first-greek-cypriot-selected-for-the-full-england-squad-for-world-cup-qualifiers|website=Parikiaki|date=August 2013|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in [[Chingford]], and is a lifelong Tottenham fan.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt; He attended [[Rush Croft Sports College]].&lt;ref name=THFCResProfile/&gt;
