===Hamilton Academical===
Born in [[Glasgow]] and raised in the city's [[Barrowfield]] district, McArthur attended [[Whitehill Secondary School]] and supported [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in his youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12380478.Family_feeling_is_the_secret_of_success_so_far_for_Hamilton/ |title=Family feeling is the secret of success so far for Hamilton |publisher=The Herald |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Rangers South BC (alongside future international colleagues [[Robert Snodgrass]] and [[Graham Dorrans]]),&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/robert-snodgrass-grassroots-football-glasgow-7592004 |title=Robert Snodgrass: Grassroots football in Glasgow was tough... but it is brilliant |work=Daily Record|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone pro youth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/scotland/james-mcarthur-i-ll-always-remember-don-hutchison-s-goal-1-4469383 |title=James McArthur: 'I'll always remember Don Hutchison's goal'|publisher=The Scotsman |date=8 June 2017|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers SABC and [[Clyde F.C.

He made his professional debut in January 2005 against [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]]. He established himself in the Hamilton team the following season and scored his first goal in April 2006 against St Johnstone.

Such was his progress that he was given the captaincy for Hamilton against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in February 2008 for a [[Scottish Cup]] tie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=477&amp;Itemid=38|title=Aberdeen 1 Accies 0|publisher=Hamilton Academical F.C|date=2 February 2008|access-date=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207100148/http://www.acciesfc.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=477&amp;Itemid=38|archive-date=7 February 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated for the First Division Player of the Year for the [[2007–08 Scottish First Division|2007–08]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/7335161.stm|title= Dorrans and McDonald on shortlist|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 after helping his side to the [[Scottish First Division]], McArthur was awarded with a new three-year contract. By the time he departed from [[New Douglas Park]] aged 22, he had played in nearly 200 matches for ''Accies''.

===Wigan Athletic===
In the 2009–10 season, several English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] and [[Premier League]] clubs, including [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], showed an interest in McArthur. On 5 April 2010, McArthur went on a three-day visit to [[Premier League]] club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] with a view to a permanent move in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hamilton_academical/8598986.stm|title= Hamilton Accies' James McArthur to visit Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a four-year contract at the [[DW Stadium]] on 23 July for a fee of around £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hamilton_academical/8839771.stm|title= James McArthur completes move from Hamilton to Wigan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2100292,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725010259/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2100292,00.html |archive-date=25 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move reunited him with former Hamilton teammate [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]], who had made the same move at the beginning of the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10]] season. On 31 January 2012, McArthur scored his first goal for Wigan in a 3–1 loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and followed it up two games later with a winning goal over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]] in a game which finished 2–1 to Wigan. McArthur extended his contract with Wigan in May 2012, with the new deal due to run until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18118717 |title=Wigan extend contract of Scotland midfielder James McArthur |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2013 McArthur won the [[FA Cup]], playing the whole game in a 1–0 upset win against [[Manchester City]].&lt;ref name=facup13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22409634 |title=Man City 0 - 1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only three days later, Wigan were relegated from the Premier League following a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22430454|title=Arsenal 4 - 1 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wigan rejected a first offer of £5 million from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for McArthur in August 2014, but then accepted a proposed valuation of nearly £7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28957513 |title=James McArthur: Leicester set to sign Wigan Athletic midfielder |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A payment schedule was not agreed and the proposed transfer collapsed, with Leicester signing [[Esteban Cambiasso]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28983784 |title=James McArthur: Leicester move for Wigan midfielder collapses |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the summer 2014 transfer window, Wigan accepted a £7 million offer from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] for McArthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29013298 |title=Transfer deadline day: Crystal Palace to sign Wigan's McArthur |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 1 September 2014, McArthur signed a three-year contract with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] after joining from Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/september/eagles-make-deadline-day-swoop-for-mcarthur/ |title=James McArthur: Eagles Make Deadline Day Swoop For McArthur |work=Crystal Palace Football Club |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a clause in his Wigan contract, his former club Hamilton received a sell-on fee from the Crystal Palace transfer, which they used to invest in the youth system through which the player had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hamilton/11147234/James-McArthur-Scottish-sides-can-follow-Hamiltons-youth-policy.html |title=James McArthur: Scottish sides can follow Hamilton's youth policy |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2017|last1=Grahame |first1=Ewing }}&lt;/ref&gt; McArthur scored his first goal for Palace on 13 December, in a 1–1 draw against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30357667 |title=Crystal Palace 1–1 Stoke |first=Tim |last=Oscroft |newspaper=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, McArthur tore ankle ligaments in a 2–1 loss to [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace's James McArthur and Jason Puncheon injured|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35498766|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in time to take part in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], which Crystal Palace lost 2–1 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after extra time.&lt;ref name=facup16&gt;{{cite web |author =Phil McNulty |title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Manchester United (aet)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36292265 |work=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2016|accessdate=28 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, having helped his club to maintain top division status for the fifth consecutive season of his spell at [[Selhurst Park]], McArthur was recognised by the Premier League for reaching 200 appearances in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/gallery/517617|title=Premier League Milestones|publisher=Premier League|date=23 May 2018|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
