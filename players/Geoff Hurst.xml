'''Sir Geoffrey Charles Hurst''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 8 December 1941)&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. A [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], he remains the only man to score a [[Hat-trick#Association_football|hat-trick]] in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final, when [[England national football team|England]] recorded a [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|4–2 victory]] over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]].

Hurst began his career with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], where he scored 242 goals in 500 first team appearances. There he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1964]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1965]]. He was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1972 for £80,000. After three seasons with Stoke he finished his [[The Football League|Football League]] career with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 1976. Hurst went to play football in Ireland ([[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]]) and the USA ([[Seattle Sounders (1974–1983)|Seattle Sounders]]) before returning to England to manage non-league [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]]. He also coached in the England set-up before an unsuccessful stint as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager from 1979 to 1981. He later coached [[Kuwait SC]] before leaving the game to concentrate on his business commitments.

In total he scored 24 goals in 49 England appearances, and as well as success in the 1966 World Cup he also appeared at [[UEFA Euro 1968]] and the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. He also had a brief [[cricket]] career, making one [[First-class cricket|First-class]] appearance for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1962, before concentrating on football.

==Early life==
Hurst was born in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Lancashire, on 8 December 1941.&lt;ref name="page 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two younger siblings: Diane and Robert.&lt;ref name="page 24"/&gt; His family moved to [[Chelmsford]], Essex when he was six years old.&lt;ref name="page 24"/&gt; His father, [[Charlie Hurst]], was a professional footballer who played at centre-half for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Evelyn Hopkins, was from a [[Gloucestershire]] family with her mother's side originally from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancestry{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he was obsessed with football, and was once fined £1 for disturbing the peace after consistently kicking a football into his neighbour's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst played one [[first-class cricket]] match for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/14322.html |title=Geoff Hurst player profile |publisher=Cricinfo.com}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Aigburth]] in 1962, although it was not a successful outing: he made 0 [[not out]] in the first [[innings]], and was [[bowled]] by Colin Hilton, again for 0, in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |title=Lancashire v Essex, County Championship 1962 |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210023255/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25458.html |archivedate=10 February 2009}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he appeared 23 times in the Essex Second XI between 1962 and 1964, usually as a wicketkeeper, before concentrating entirely on football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |title=Second Eleven Championship Matches played by Geoff Hurst (23) |publisher=CricketArchive.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155741/http://acscricket.com/Archive/Players/4/4915/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |archivedate=10 February 2009}} Retrieved on 12 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his father's management of the club, Hurst played once for [[Halstead Town F.C.|Halstead Town]] reserves at the age of "about 14".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&amp;newsmode=FULL&amp;nid=10155 |title=HURST WILL BE ROOTING FOR A SUDBURY WIN |date=10 May 2003 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Non League Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001022639/http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&amp;newsmode=FULL&amp;nid=10155 |archivedate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Hurst's football career began when he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Ted Fenton]] first selected him for a senior game in a [[Southern Professional Floodlit Cup|Southern Floodlit Cup]] tie with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in December 1958.&lt;ref name="page 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid £7 a week with a £20 signing on fee.&lt;ref name="page 31"/&gt; His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3–1.&lt;ref name="page 31"/&gt; He made only two further appearances in the [[1959–60 Football League|1959–60]] season, and realised that [[Bobby Moore]] was making better progress in the same position than he was.&lt;ref name="page 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played six times in the [[1960–61 Football League|1960–61]] campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket.&lt;ref name="page 32"/&gt; In April 1961 [[Ron Greenwood]] took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst missed the start of [[1961–62 Football League|1961–62]] pre-season training due to his cricketing commitments, but went on to make 24 appearances at left-half, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in December 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that season Greenwood tried playing Hurst as a striker after deciding that the defensive side of his game was a weakness for the young midfielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a successful partnership with [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] and went on to score 13 goals in 27 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] games whilst Byrne scored nine in 30 games in the [[1962–63 Football League|1962–63]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of [[1963 International Soccer League|1963]] he joined the club on their pre-season tour of [[New York (state)|New York]], and greatly benefited from playing against top quality players from clubs across the world in the [[International Soccer League]], a friendly tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst and West Ham had a poor start to the [[1963–64 Football League|1963–64]] season, and went on to finish in 14th place. However it was in the [[FA Cup]] where the team impressed. A comfortable 3–0 home win over [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] was followed by another 3–0 home win over East End rivals [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]&amp;nbsp;– though only following a tough 1–1 draw at [[Brisbane Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood named the same 11 players, including Hurst, in all the club's seven FA Cup fixtures as West Ham progressed to the final. Hurst scored one against Charlton and two against Orient, and claimed another goal in the Fifth Round as West Ham beat Second Division [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] 3–1 at the [[County Ground (Swindon)|County Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] provided a stern test in the quarter-finals, but a 3–2 home win took West Ham into the semi-finals, where they faced [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham won 3–1, with Hurst scoring the final goal of the game after being set up by Bobby Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham faced Second Division [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in the [[1964 FA Cup Final]], and had to come from behind twice to win the match 3–2. Hurst scored his side's second equaliser with a header that bounced under the crossbar and ended up just over the goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's success won them a place in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] for the [[1964–65 European Cup Winners' Cup|1964–65]] season. They defeated Belgian side [[K.A.A. Gent]] in the First Round after an unconvincing 2–1 aggregate victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czechoslovakian side [[AC Sparta Prague]] awaited in the second round, and West Ham progressed with a 3–2 aggregate victory despite the absence of Moore.&lt;ref name="page 73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite beating Swiss team [[FC Lausanne-Sport]] 6–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hurst had still not registered a goal in the competition as he was played in a withdrawn role behind [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] so as to strengthen the midfield.&lt;ref name="page 73"/&gt; In the semi-finals, West Ham defended a 2–1 home win over Spanish club [[Real Zaragoza]] with a 1–1 draw at [[La Romareda]] to claim a place in the [[1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] against [[TSV 1860 München]] at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham won 2–0, [[Alan Sealey]] scoring both goals, to give the club their first European trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having scored 40 goals in 59 competitive games in the [[1965–66 Football League|1965–66]] season and then gone on to make himself a household name by winning the World Cup with England, Hurst was the subject of a £200,000 transfer offer by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]]&amp;nbsp;– the offer was rejected by Greenwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the West Ham side which lost the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final 5–3 on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the [[1966–67 Football League|1966–67]] season, West Ham demonstrated the inconsistency that would deny them a realistic prospect of winning a league championship under Greenwood. Hurst scored a hat-trick as they defeated full-strength title challengers [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 7–0 in the League Cup, but they exited the FA Cup with a 3–1 defeat to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"When you're playing for a team that can score seven one day and four the next it's really quite good fun. When job satisfaction is that high, why would you want to play for anyone else?"|Like his manager, Ron Greenwood, Hurst valued entertaining attacking football played in a fair manner and was not prepared to sacrifice these values for silverware.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hurst scored six goals in a First Division match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Upton Park on 19 October 1968, which West Ham won 8–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20091030/sunderland-match-preview_2236884_1842142 |title=Sunderland match preview |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827085449/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20091030/sunderland-match-preview_2236884_1842142 |archivedate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he regretted admitting that he handled the ball in his first goal which led to the back page headlines focusing on the illegitimate goal rather than the rare feat of one player scoring six goals in one game.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, West Ham reached the semi-finals of the League Cup when they played [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] over two legs. In the home leg at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], they were awarded a penalty after [[Harry Redknapp]] was fouled in the box.&lt;ref name="page 232"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst took the penalty and struck a powerful shot into the top corner which was saved by [[Gordon Banks]], who succeeded in deflecting the ball over the bar.&lt;ref name="page 232"/&gt; Stoke won the tie in the subsequent replay and denied Hurst one more final appearance at Wembley.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Stoke City===
Hurst was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for a £80,000 fee in August 1972.&lt;ref name=whustats&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Geoff Hurst |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=345&amp;united=Geoff_Hurst |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Tony |title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City |year=1994 |publisher=Lion Press |isbn=0-9524151-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was struck down with [[pneumonia]] early in 1973 and went to South Africa to recover, playing on loan for [[Roy Bailey (footballer)|Roy Bailey]]'s [[Cape Town City F.C. (NFL)|Cape Town City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed just four games for Stoke and upon his return he helped the side to maintain their [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1974, "Potters" manager [[Tony Waddington]] asked Hurst to take in new signing [[Alan Hudson]] as a lodger so as to provide the talented but troubled midfielder with a stable home during his Stoke career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson adapted well to life in the Hurst household and Stoke recorded a fifth place in the [[1973–74 Stoke City F.C. season|1973–74]] season&amp;nbsp;– a career high for Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored 11 goals in 41 games in the [[1974–75 Stoke City F.C. season|1974–75]] season and helped Stoke to finish in fifth place, just four points behind champions [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===West Bromwich Albion===
Hurst was sold to [[Johnny Giles]]'s [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the summer of 1975 for a fee of £20,000.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; He played 12 times for the Baggies at the start of the [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]] season, scoring twice, before deciding to leave for America.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/&gt; Hurst later acknowledged that at the age of 34 he was too old to lead the line in the "Baggies" push for promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Hurst signed for [[Cork Celtic F.C.|Cork Celtic]] in January 1976, and remained in Ireland for one month.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

He signed for the [[Seattle Sounders (1974–1983)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]] in 1976. Hurst rapidly proved his worth, and became a valuable member of the Sounders team. He was the team's second-leading scorer, helping the Sounders make it to the play-offs for the first time in their brief history, with eight goals and four assists in 23 regular season games, and one goal in the play-offs.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==International career==
===1966 World Cup===
Hurst made his senior [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] on 23 February 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played well, and further performances against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] secured him a place in the squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he put in mediocre performances in warm-up games against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and so [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Roger Hunt]] were instead picked for the final friendly game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref name="page 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greaves and Hunt were indeed picked for the three group games against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and France, but in the later game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter final against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref name="page 7"/&gt;

Argentina were talented but preferred a tougher approach to the game, which saw them reduced to ten men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was still tightly contested as it entered its final 15 minutes, but then [[Martin Peters]] swung over a curling cross from the left flank and Hurst, anticipating his clubmate's action, got in front of his marker to glance a near post header past the Argentine keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won 1–0 and were in the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=239/match=1577/index.html |title=1996 FIFA World Cup 1966 |publisher=fifa.com}} Retrieved on 24 January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greaves was not fit for the game against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] so Hurst and Hunt continued up front, and England won 2–1 thanks to two goals by [[Bobby Charlton]], the second of which was set up by Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves' return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst's contribution, started to call for the return of England's most prolific [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forward]]. Ramsey, however, would not be swayed and selected Hurst for [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

====World Cup Final====
West Germany took the lead through [[Helmut Haller]] early on, but six minutes later [[Bobby Moore]] was fouled just inside the German half of the field. He quickly picked himself up and delivered the free kick to Hurst, who eluded his marker 
[[Horst-Dieter Höttges]] and headed the ball past goalkeeper [[Hans Tilkowski]] to level the scores at 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 12 minutes left to play of normal time, an [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] corner left Hurst with a shooting opportunity on the edge of the penalty area; his shot deflected off [[Wolfgang Weber]] and fell kindly to [[Martin Peters]], who put the ball into the net to give England the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Germans scored a very late goal through Weber to level the match at 2–2 at full-time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the first period of extra-time, Ball made a cross across the near post to Hurst, who struck a strong shot towards goal with his right foot, falling backwards as he did so.&lt;ref name="page 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner. England's players claimed a goal whilst the Germans were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line.&lt;ref name="page 13"/&gt; Referee [[Gottfried Dienst]] consulted his linesman on the right flank, [[Tofiq Bahramov]], who signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and the goal was given.&lt;ref name="page 13"/&gt;

The Germans pushed forward in search of an equaliser as the full-time whistle approached, and [[Bobby Moore]] exploited their advanced position to send Hurst a long ball in the German half of the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurst reached the German penalty box and fired a powerful shot in the expectation that it would sail over the crossbar and waste time as the match drew to a close; the ball instead struck a divot as it bounced in front of Hurst and the shot connected well enough to beat the goalkeeper and hit the net to end the game at 4–2 to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Hurst collected the pass, [[BBC]] commentator [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]] immortalised his own contribution to the day with one of the most famous pieces of football commentary:

{{quote|And here comes Hurst, he's got&amp;nbsp;... [notices invaders]&amp;nbsp;... some people are on the pitch, [[they think it's all over]]! [Hurst shoots and scores]&amp;nbsp;... It is now! It's four!}}

===Later international career===
Hurst was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1968]], but did not play as England lost 1–0 to [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in the semi-final. He did play, and score, in the 2–0 third-place play-off victory over the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored his second international hat-trick on 12 March 1969, in a 5–0 victory over [[France national football team|France]], and was named in the Ramsey squad which played in [[Mexico]] to defend the World Cup in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the only goal of England's opening game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] after being sent through by a pass from [[Francis Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; England progressed to the quarter finals, where once again they faced West Germany. Hurst played a part in the [[Martin Peters]] goal that put England 2–0 up. With England up 2–1, Hurst's contested header trickled inches past the post. Later, at 2–2, Hurst had what many thought was a legitimate goal ruled out for offside.&lt;ref&gt;England: The Official F.A History, Niall Edworthy, Virgin Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85227-699-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The West Germans scored in extra time and won 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst scored against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in qualification for [[UEFA Euro 1972]], but played his last international match on 29 April 1972 as England were beaten 3–1 by West Germany&amp;nbsp;– he was replaced by [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]] with 20 minutes left to play and did not take to the field in an England shirt again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named in the squad for the second leg against West Germany after [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] and Francis Lee picked up injuries, but had to pull out of the squad after picking up an injury himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
Upon his retirement from playing, Hurst moved into management and coaching. He spent three years as player-manager of [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]] in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] before being recruited by [[Ron Greenwood]] in the [[England national football team|England]] coaching set up in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled with England to help Greenwood at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], where England failed to make it past the group stages on both occasions.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Chelsea===
Hurst joined [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], then in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], before the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season, initially as assistant manager to [[Danny Blanchflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Blanchflower was sacked, Hurst was appointed manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hired [[Bobby Gould]] as his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Things initially went well, and for much of the season Chelsea were on course for promotion, but two wins from their final seven league games ensured the club finished fourth. He raised £250,000 through the sales of [[Eamonn Bannon]], [[David Stride]] and [[Trevor Aylott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent £300,000 on [[Colin Lee]], [[Dennis Rofe]] and [[Colin Viljoen]]; he later acknowledged Viljoen as a mistake whilst bemoaning Lee's bad luck with injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season again began well, with the "Blues" among the early promotion pace-setters before a dismal run set in, with Chelsea scoring in just three of their final 22 league matches, culminating in Hurst being sacked on 30 April 1981 and Chelsea finished 12th in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuwait SC===
After being sacked from Chelsea on 23 April 1981 Hurst worked as an insurance salesman for [[Abbey Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he was tempted back into management after being offered a generous salary by [[Kuwait SC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; He controversially disciplined and dropped club captain [[Saad Al-Houti]], but was unable to challenge [[Dave Mackay]]'s [[Al-Arabi SC (Kuwait)|Al-Arabi]] for dominance of the [[Kuwaiti Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Kuwait in April 1984 he returned to the insurance trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 2003 Hurst was included in ''The Champions'', a statue of 1966 World Cup winning footballers, by sculptor [[Philip Jackson (sculptor)|Philip Jackson]]. It sits at the junctions of [[A124 road|Barking Road]] and Central Park Road, [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], London, near to the site of West Ham United's former home stadium, the [[Boleyn Ground]] and features [[Martin Peters]], Hurst, [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Champions |url=http://www.philipjacksonsculptures.co.uk/Commissions/Champions_i.htm |publisher=phillipjacksonsculptures.co.uk |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst's contribution to the English game was recognised in 2004 when he was inducted in the [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Hurst is also one of the few footballers who have been knighted.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

A statue of Hurst was unveiled outside [[Curzon Ashton F.C.]]'s ground in 2010. He is shown alongside two other World Cup winners born in the area, fellow 1966 squad member [[Jimmy Armfield]], and [[Simone Perrotta]], who won it with Italy in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12383705 |title=World Cup hero's home town statue in Greater Manchester |publisher=BBC News |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He now lives in [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Memories-wanted-Geoff-Hurst-book/story-13242971-detail/story.html |title=Memories wanted for Geoff Hurst book |publisher=thisisgloucestershire.co.uk |accessdate=21 October 2013}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his wife Judith. They have been married since 13 October 1964, having met three years previously at a youth centre; [[Eddie Presland]] was best man.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurst|2002|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-389630/Footballers-wives-1966-relive-memories.html |last=Pearlman |first=Natasha |location=London |work=Daily Mail |title=Footballers' wives of 1966 relive the memories |date=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
