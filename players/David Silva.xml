==Early life==

His father, Fernando, is [[Spaniards|Spanish]] (Canarian) while his mother, Eva, is of Japanese descent, claimed by the Canarian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Silva, el nieto de 'la tirajanera' |url=http://www.laprovincia.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008063000_1_160807__Portada-Las-Palmas-David-Silva-nieto-tirajanera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1290896/Manchester-City-new-boy-David-Silva-Prada-wearing-machete-fighter-started-life-goal.html |title=Manchester City new boy David Silva: The Prada-wearing Japanese machete fighter who started life in goal... |newspaper=Daily Mail |first1=Max |last1=Lakey |first2=Josh |last2=Taylor |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva began playing football in the youth team of UD San Fernando, near [[Maspalomas]]. Originally, he played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], before becoming a [[Winger (association football)|winger]]&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{Cite news |title=David Silva: From a childhood in a Spanish fishing village to Premier League superstar... |last=Kay |first=Alex |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2051589/David-Silva-From-Spanish-fishing-village-Premier-League-superstar.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mirrored his game around his footballing idol as a youth, [[Michael Laudrup]].&lt;ref name="career"/&gt; When he was 14, he received an offer to become a youth player at [[Valencia CF]], which he accepted. He stayed in Valencia's youth set-up until he was 17.

==Club career==
===Valencia===
[[File:David Silva vs Newcastle.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Silva playing for Valencia]]
A product of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]'s youth system, Silva made his professional debut in [[2004–05 Segunda División|2004–05]], with [[Segunda División]]'s [[SD Eibar|Eibar]], while on loan from Valencia, playing 35 league games and scoring on five occasions. In the [[2005–06 La Liga|following season]], he was again out on loan, this time to [[Celta de Vigo]], where he played 34 matches, scoring four goals. After two late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] appearances, the first in a 2–0 home win over [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] on 28 August 2005, Silva finished as an undisputed starter as the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] side reached the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] straight from the second-tier.

Silva returned to Valencia in the summer of 2006, becoming an automatic first-choice despite his young age of 20. In two seasons combined, he only missed six matches and netted 14 goals, his first league goal coming on 5 November 2006 in a 1–1 draw at [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]]. In August 2008, he extended his contract by five years, amidst interest of several [[Premier League]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7559788.stm |title=Silva opts to stay with Valencia |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[2007–08 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey 2008]], his first title in [[Spain]].

After not appearing in the first three months of [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09]] due to a chronic [[ankle]] ailment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=748802.html |title=Silva resigned to three-month absence |publisher=UEFA |date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva returned to the call-ups in mid-December. On 3 January 2009, he scored twice in a 3–1 home win over [[Atlético Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=790351.html |title=Barça stride on, Silva inspires Valencia |publisher=UEFA |date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; still contributing with 19 matches (four goals) as the ''Che'' qualified for the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].

In the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]], Silva scored a career-best eight goals, as Valencia finished in third position and [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|returned]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. On 15 April 2010, he scored a brace against [[Athletic Bilbao]] for a 2–0 home win,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/marcador/futbol/2009_10/primera/jornada_32/val_ath/ La Champions es más fácil con Silva (Champions League is easier with Silva)]; [[Diario Marca]], 15 April 2010 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding three assists in the 4–4 thriller at [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] for the Europa League's [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|round of 16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000039/match=2000954/postmatch/quotes/index.html |title=Villa revels in Valencia's 'crazy' night |publisher=UEFA |first=Trevor |last=Huggins |date=18 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322194435/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season%3D2010/round%3D2000039/match%3D2000954/postmatch/quotes/index.html |archivedate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
====2010–11====
[[File:David Silva.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Silva with Manchester City in April 2011]]
On 30 June 2010, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] announced that they had reached an agreement with Valencia over the transfer of Silva and that he would join the club on a four-year deal, prior to the start of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6238493,00.html City clinch Silva deal]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926004450/http://www.skysports.com/story/0%2C19528%2C11661_6238493%2C00.html |date=26 September 2015 }}; [[Sky Sports]], 30 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, the Premier League side completed the signing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/808743/new-manchester-city-boy-david-silva-targets-champions-league |title=New City boy Silva targets Champions League |publisher=ESPN FC |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silva was awarded the number 21 shirt, the same number he wore for Valencia and when playing for [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

On 2 March, he scored from 20 yards out in an [[FA Cup]] win (3–0) against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Three days later, he scored the only goal in Manchester City's win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Silva netted the third goal in City's 5–0 rout of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 3 April.

In the first [[Manchester Derby]] of the season at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester City won 6–1, with Silva proving, yet again, to be instrumental in the Manchester City attack, scoring the fifth goal, setting up Edin Džeko's second with a chested volley pass through the United defense, and participating in the first two goals with excellent passing to [[James Milner]] to assist [[Mario Balotelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/117650.html |title=Triple Dutch |publisher=ESPN |first=Chris |last=Murphy |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2011, in an interview with a Spanish radio station, Silva revealed that he turned down [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] so he could sign for City, and that he wants to stay at the club for years.

In the opening match of the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]] season, in a 0–3 win at [[West Bromich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], Silva delivered a performance his manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] labelled "unbelievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/it-was-an-unbelievable-performance-from-david-silva-says-manchester-city-manager-manuel-pellegrini/ |title=It was an unbelievable performance from David Silva, says Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini |work=[[Indian Express]] |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as assisting the team's third goal, Silva was later credited with the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-city/story/2562014/david-silva-credited-with-scoring-man-citys-first-goal |title=David Silva credited with scoring Man City's first goal rather than Yaya Toure |publisher=ESPN FC |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After contributing another three assists for the team in August (in wins against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33839794 |title=Manchester City 3–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=16 August 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34025307 |title=Manchester City 2–0 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Chris |last=Bevan |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva was nominated for both of the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Premier League Player of the Month]] Awards for August, winning the former.&lt;ref name="Aug15POTM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2015/September/David-Silva-is-Etihad-Player-of-the-Month-for-August-2015/1442575826 |title=Silva voted Etihad Player of the Month |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919232349/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2015/September/David-Silva-is-Etihad-Player-of-the-Month-for-August-2015/1442575826 |archivedate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34216391 |title=Andre Ayew &amp; Manuel Pellegrini win Premier League awards |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:David Silva and Leonardo Bonucci Euro 2012 final.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Silva (left) on the ball for Spain in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final]]]]
Silva first represented Spain in the [[2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in [[Finland]], scoring three goals. In 2006, he became an [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21 international]] and scored four goals during the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]; this was enough to earn him joint-fourth place in the goal ranking, alongside Italian [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Graziano Pellè]].

Silva made his [[Spain national football team|senior international]] debut in the 1–0 friendly home defeat to [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 15 November 2006, and continued to receive call-ups to the side after good contributions in his first games. On 22 August 2007, he scored his first two goals for Spain, netting twice in a 3–2 friendly win versus [[Greece national football team|Greece]], and was then called up to the squad of 23 for [[UEFA Euro 2008]].

In the semi-finals game versus [[Russia national football team|Russia]], Silva scored the third goal for Spain after a quick counter-attack in which [[Cesc Fàbregas]] delivered a low cross, and he sent the ball into [[Igor Akinfeev]]'s goal with his left foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=301698/index.html Clinical Spain set up Germany final date]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911200335/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match%3D301698/index.html |date=11 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|the final]], he was involved in an incident with [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s [[Lukas Podolski]]. After he pulled Podolski to the ground, the German approached Silva, which resulted in an angry exchange of words and a coming together of heads that the referee decided not to punish. Shortly afterward, Spanish coach [[Luis Aragonés]] substituted Silva for [[Santi Cazorla]] in an attempt to calm the tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7363545.stm |title=Germany 0–1 Spain |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=29 June 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing regularly during [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification]] – Spain won all ten fixtures – Silva was also picked for the squad for the finals in [[South Africa]]. His participation was, however, a small one, as the national team won the tournament: he started in the first match, a 0–1 group stage defeat against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], then played the last four minutes of the 1–0 win against Germany in the semi-finals.

On 11 August 2010, during an international friendly with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], Silva scored two minutes into second-half injury time, ending the game with a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=290887&amp;league=FIFA.FRIENDLY&amp;cc=5739 |title=Silva salvages draw for Spain |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifier]] against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] on 3 September 2010, Silva scored after 62 minutes, in a 4–0 away win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=299308&amp;cc=4716 Torres grabs brace for Spain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907044308/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=299308&amp;cc=4716 |date=7 September 2010 }}; ESPNsoccernet, 3 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, in the same competition, he scored through a rare header, as the national team downed [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] in [[Salamanca]] (3–1).

In a friendly against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] on 9 February 2011, he came off the bench to score the game's only goal with just four minutes remaining, helping Spain to a hard-fought 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/57279/spain-vs-colombia/report |title=Spain 1–0 Colombia: Substitute David Silva grabs late winner to save lacklustre world champions |work=Goal.com |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice and provided one assist in Spain's 3–1 victory against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in their final match of the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifiers]].

Heading into Euro 2012, he scored in their pre-tournament friendly against [[China football team|China]] by finishing off a short give and go from [[Andrés Iniesta]] in the 84th minute.

Silva was a starter in all six matches of Spain's Euro 2012 campaign. In the 14th minute of the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|Euro 2012 Final]], he headed home a Cesc Fàbregas cross, giving Spain a 1–0 lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/346764/report.html?=dsf |title=Spain claim historic win |date=1 July 2012 |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115231727/http://espnfc.com/en/report/346764/report.html?=dsf |archivedate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The match ended 4–0 and concluded the tournament in which Silva scored two goals and made three assists, the best efficiency (goals and assists) of any player at the Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/records/index/league/uefa-euro/season/2012/statsnrecords.html |title=Stats &amp; Records |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615173808/http://www.espnfc.com/en/records/index/league/uefa-euro/season/2012/statsnrecords.html |archivedate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently named in UEFA's Euro 2012 Team of the Tournament for his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA EURO 2012 Team of the Tournament |url=http://www.uefa.org/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=1838241.html?rss=1838241+UEFA+EURO+2012+Team+of+the+Tournament |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=3 February 2014 |date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Silva 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|Silva represented [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.]]

Silva was named in Vicente del Bosque's 23-man squad list for Spain's contestation of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], held in Brazil. On 20 June 2013, he scored two goals in Spain's 10–0 [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Group B|group stage]] demolition of [[Tahiti national football team|Tahiti]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium|Maracanã]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/365339/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901 |title=Torres' 4 goals inspire Spanish rout |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |publisher=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being part of Spain's consecutive unsuccessful campaigns at [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Silva continued his goal scoring record under new boss Julen Lopetegui, scoring 9 times in 12 matches.{{citation needed|date= June 2017}} In May 2018 Silva was named to Spain's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;(Simpson, Christopher) [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2777080-david-de-gea-isco-headline-spains-full-2018-world-cup-provisional-squad-roster David De Gea, Isco Headline Spain's Full 2018 World Cup Provisional Squad Roster] ''Bleacher Report''.

After the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] Silva announced his retirement from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45176114 |title=David Silva: Manchester City's Spain midfielder retires from international football |accessdate=21 November 2018 |date=13 August 2018 |publisher=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
