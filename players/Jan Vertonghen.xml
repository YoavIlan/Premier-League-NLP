'''Jan Bert Lieve Vertonghen''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈjɑn vərˈtɔŋə(n)}}; born 24 April 1987) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. Mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], he can also play as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]].

He began his senior career at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2006 and totalled 220 games and 28 goals for them across all competitions, serving as their captain since 2011. He won two [[Eredivisie]] and two [[KNVB Cup]] titles during his time at the club, and in 2012 he was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]]. Vertonghen transferred to Tottenham in July 2012, and made the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in his first [[Premier League]] season, going on to make over 200 appearances for Spurs and winning their player of the year award in 2018.

Vertonghen made his international debut for Belgium in 2007 and his 110 caps (including [[Belgium national football team results – unofficial matches#2010s|three unofficial games]], according to FIFA rules) are the most in the history of the national team. He was part of Belgian squads that came fourth at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and reached the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] as well as third place at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Vertonghen was born in [[Sint-Niklaas]], Belgium, to Ria Mattheeuws and Paul Vertonghen.&lt;ref name=IndyDec2012&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/exclusive-interview-jan-vertonghen-spurred-on-by-tottenhams-fight-for-fourth-8418339.html |title=Exclusive interview: Jan Vertonghen spurred on by Tottenham's fight |last=Wallace |first=Sam |date=15 December 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.90min.com/posts/4304829-spurs-star-s-mother-admits-white-hart-lane-exit-could-be-close-due-to-homesickness-issues|title=Spurs Star's Mother Admits White Hart Lane Exit Could Be Close Due to 'Homesickness' Issues|last=Flavius|first=Kavan|date=21 December 2016|website=90min.com |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two brothers, Ward and Lode; both have played football.&lt;ref name=IndyDec2012/&gt;

==Club career==
===Ajax===
[[File:Shevchenko vertonghen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vertonghen marking [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]'s [[Andriy Shevchenko]] in 2010]]
After spending time at VK Tielrode and [[Germinal Beerschot]], Vertonghen moved to the Netherlands and signed a contract with the youth academy of [[Eredivisie]] side [[AFC Ajax]]. He began as a midfielder but then became a regular at centre-back for Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jan Vertonghen tevreden met positie bij Ajax|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/39673/jan-vertonghen-tevreden-met-positie-bij-ajax-list|work=Voetbal Centraal|date=12 November 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the [[Jong Ajax|reserves]], he became known for an incident in a [[2005–06 KNVB Cup|2006 KNVB Cup]] game against [[Cambuur Leeuwarden]], his first home game at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], where he scored a goal to put Ajax 3–0 up. He had attempted a back pass to the Cambuur goalkeeper while a teammate was receiving treatment but instead the ball went into the goal. Since it was  unintentional, Ajax allowed Cambuur to score a goal in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gatorade Cup: Young Ajax beat Cambuur in memorable game|url=http://www.ajaxusa.com/news/2005-2006/gatorade-cup-young-ajax-beat-cambuur-in-memorable-game.html|publisher=Ajax USA|date=20 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to RKC====
On 23 August 2006, Vertonghen made his first team debut in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. He made his first start and Eredivisie debut in a 6–0 win over [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] at the Amsterdam ArenA and would play another two matches for the first half of the season. After the winter break, he was sent on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to struggling [[RKC Waalwijk]] for the remainder of the season. At RKC, he would play 12 matches in which he scored three times, but he was unable to help the team avoid relegation to the [[Eerste Divisie]].

Vertonghen returned to Ajax for the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]], where he was tipped for stardom, but was unable to break through due to a severe injury and the presence of central defenders [[John Heitinga]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]]. [[Johan Cruyff]] had made no secret of his admiration for the left-footed youngster who can handle any left-sided position in defence and midfield, opting, on 26 September 2008, to extend his contract to 30 June 2013.

====Breakthrough at Ajax====
The [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]] was a breakthrough season for the young defender. After John Heitinga left for [[Atlético Madrid]], Vertonghen became Thomas Vermaelen's first-choice partner in central defence; the former started 23 of the 26 games he played in and scored four goals. On 28 September, he scored a rare double against [[Vitesse Arnhem|Vitesse]] in a 3–0 win. Although sustaining an injury from training during the week, he played in the match against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] on 24 January, billed as a "must-win" match by coach [[Marco van Basten]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preview: FC Groningen vs Ajax Amsterdam|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=249496&amp;cc=3888&amp;league=NED.1|work=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen was unfortunate enough to be sent off for two yellow cards as Ajax lost 1–0. He was out for a month after sustaining a hamstring injury in an away win on 1 March against [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]], but his return lasted only several games after his season was prematurely ended after aggravating another injury.

====Rising importance under Jol====
[[File:Vertonghen Stekelenburg.jpg|thumb|Vertonghen with [[Maarten Stekelenburg]].]]
Under new coach [[Martin Jol]], Vertonghen retained his place in the starting line-up for the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]]. Despite injuring his toe while on international duty against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] the previous week, he scored his first goal of the season, a free kick, in a 6–0 thrashing of [[NAC Breda]] on 13 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match Report: Ajax Amsterdam vs NAC Breda|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271828&amp;cc=3888&amp;league=NED.1|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], he and fellow Belgian [[Toby Alderweireld]] become the first choice centre-back pairing and soon became a firm fans' favourite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen is een echte Hollander'|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-is-een-echte-hollander.aspx|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Ajax's erratic form in the latter weeks leading up to the winter break, he turned in some strong performances and attracted the interest of a number of clubs, including [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but he played down the rumours, stating his intent to at least see out his contract with Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Jan Vertonghen in beeld bij FC Barcelona'|url=http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Barça.html|work=[[De Pers]]|date=17 February 2010|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224031455/http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Bar%C3%A7a.html|archivedate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guardiola estaría siguiendo a Vertonghen|url=http://www.sport.es/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=44&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=687794&amp;idseccio_PK=803|work=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|date=16 February 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the winter break, Ajax went on a nine-game unbeaten streak in the league, with Vertonghen playing a key role. Their run of six consecutive clean sheets was ended in a 4–1 home win over [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] when the visiting side were awarded a penalty. Vertonghen was linked with a move to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and later he was also linked with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], stating, "I've heard Milan Director [[Adriano Galliani]] talk about me after the Champions League match in [[San Siro]] and his words were very flattering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vertonghen linked to Milan|url=http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan|publisher=Goal-arena.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216043647/http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan/|archivedate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|Vertonghen (top right) [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing Ajax.]]
Vertonghen stated on numerous occasions late in the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] that he was considering leaving Ajax at the end of that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vertonghen weighing up move |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_6722248,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=4 February 2011|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ajax star targets Prem switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6921360,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, [[Frank de Boer]] confirmed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] boss [[Roberto Mancini]] was present at the [[2010-11 KNVB Cup|2011 KNVB Cup Final]] held on 7 May 2011, where Vertonghen's side lost 3–2 to [[FC Twente|Twente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6925317,00.html|title=City keep eye on Vertonghen|date=13 May 2011|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mancini was reportedly scouting Vertonghen to strengthen his side after they had qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] 2011–12 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/918003/man-city-scout-jan-vertonghen,-axel-witsel-and-kevin-de-bruyne?cc=5901|title=City scout Belgian trio|date=10 May 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakthrough under De Boer====
During the [[2011–12 Eredivisie]] season, Vertonghen emerged as one of Ajax's best players, demonstrating his versatility to cover multiple positions after Ajax had let several regular players out on long-term loans. After an impressive season, including a performance for which he was singled out for praise against Manchester United in the [[UEFA Europa League]] Round of 16, he was named the 2011–12 [[Dutch Footballer of the Year|Eredivisie Player of the Year]]. Named team captain by [[Frank de Boer]], he led his Ajax to their second title in a row, scoring eight goals in 31 league games, highlighting his attacking strengths. Also, for the second time, he dropped the Championship plate. "Now it falls on my toe&amp;nbsp;– this plate just does not like me," Vertonghen said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season review: Netherlands|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1800379.html#season+review+netherlands|publisher=by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
====2012–13 season====
Throughout the 2011–12 season, Vertonghen was linked with English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and publicly expressed his desire to make the move to [[White Hart Lane]] ahead of numerous other teams. A key factor in this was his desire to play as a centre-back, with Arsenal wanting to use him as a defensive midfielder. On 8 July 2012, Tottenham agreed a fee and terms for Vertonghen subject to a medical. On 12 July, Tottenham announced that they had officially completed the signing of Vertonghen, for an amount around 12 million Euros, after he successfully completed his medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Vertonghen completes Tottenham move from Ajax|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18761297|publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tottenham on the verge of completing transfer of Jan Vertonghen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/08/tottenham-signing-jan-vertonghen-ajax|publisher=The Guardian |date=8 July 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen took part in his first game as a Tottenham player in a 3–2 friendly win against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 14 July, then later scored his first goal for the club on 26 September in a 3–0 win against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in the third round of the [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645193 |title=Carlisle 0–3 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertonghen scored his first [[Premier League]] goal against Manchester United in a historic 2–3 win at [[Old Trafford]], although this was later ruled to be an own goal by [[Jonny Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/261615/report "Spurs end United hoodoo"] Skysport. 29 September 2012. Retrieved 29 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored in the league for Tottenham on 16 December, the only goal of the game, in a win at White Hart Lane against [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/premier-league/2012-2013/tottenham-hotspur-swansea-city-515473.html "Premier League&amp;nbsp;– Vertonghen strike sinks Swansea"] UK Yahoo. 16 December 2012. Retrieved 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen then scored a brace in a losing effort against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 10 March. He was named [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for March 2013, making himself the second Belgian and the 12th Spurs player to win the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen and Moyes win Barclays awards|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/apr/david-moyes-and-jan-vertonghen-win-barclays-march-awards.html|work=Barclays Premier League|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729045920/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/apr/david-moyes-and-jan-vertonghen-win-barclays-march-awards.html|archivedate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 2013, Vertonghen was sent-off against [[FC Basel|Basel]] during Tottenham's [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League#Quarter-finals|Europa League quarter-final second leg]]. Tottenham went on to lose the tie 4–1 on penalties after a 4–4 draw on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FC Basel 2–2 Tottenham (agg 4–4)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22023547|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertonghen was named in the 2012–13 [[PFA Team of the Year]], alongside [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Leighton Baines]] and [[Pablo Zabaleta]] in defence.&lt;ref name=1213PFA&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22331030 |title=Gareth Bale wins PFA Player of Year and Young Player awards |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
[[File:Chelsea 3 Spurs 0 (15953303611).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Vertonghen (right) playing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2014.]]
At the start of the [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 season]], Vertonghen appeared to be out of favour with new manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]]. The Argentine gave Vertonghen limited games, preferring [[Younès Kaboul]] and [[Federico Fazio]]. However, Kaboul lost his place to Vertonghen, who formed an effective partnership with Fazio. Together, the pair, over the span of 15 games, celebrated 11 wins and only suffered one loss. Vertonghen helped Spurs to reach the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup Final]] and started the game on 1 March 2015, but Tottenham lost to [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] 2–0.&lt;ref name=2015LC&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Chelsea 2–0 Tottenham Hotspur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31572594 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season====
Vertonghen was joined in defence by former Ajax teammate and compatriot Alderweireld at the start of the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]]. Over the first ten games of the season, Vertonghen and Alderweireld played ten out of the opening ten games together, with Spurs suffering only one loss during the span.  In late January 2016, he damaged his medial knee-ligament and did not play for 11 weeks.&lt;ref name="injury"/&gt; He returned in the home match against Manchester United on 10 April 2016, which finished in a 3–0 win, the first home league win for Tottenham against Manchester United since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/660766/Tottenham-Jan-Vertonghen-Manchester-United-Premier-League-news-rumours |title=Tottenham star: Why Manchester United win was easy |first=James |last= Gray|date=13 April 2016 |work=Sunday Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; His partnership with Alderweireld in the defence was recognised as being crucial for the club which had the joint-lowest number of goals conceded in the Premier League that season.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/features/the-big-interview/the-big-interview-with-jan-vertonghen-120416/ |title=THE Big Interview- Jan Vertonghen|date= 12 April 2016  |work=Tottenham Hotspur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2016, Vertonghen signed a new contract with Tottenham until 2019.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/02/jan-vertonghen-tottenham-new-contract|title=Jan Vertonghen signs new deal with Tottenham until 2019|website=The Guardian|date=2 December 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in mid January 2017, Vertonghen suffered an ankle ligament injury that would see him out of action for five weeks.&lt;ref name="injury"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/17/tottenham-jan-vertonghen-ankle-injury |title=Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen facing up to two months out with ankle injury |first= Dominic |last=Fifield|date= 17 January 2017 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to the team on 19 February in the fifth round [[2016–17 FA Cup|FA Cup]] match against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/tottenham-news-jan-vertonghen-targeting-europa-league-and-fa-cup-trophies-this-season-a7589521.html |title=Jan Vertonghen targeting Europa League and FA Cup trophies this season as Tottenham get back in the groove |first=Jack|last= Pitt-Brooke |date= 20 February 2017 |work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This season, Vertonghen was part of the Tottenham defence that achieved the best defensive record for the club, with only 26 goals conceded in the Premier League (and only 9 conceded in home league games), 6 better than the previous record of 32 conceded that was set in the [[1908–09 in English football|1908–09 season]] in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2016-17-in-numbers-few-goals-conceded-020617/ |title=2016–17 in Numbers – New Defensive Records|date= 2 June 2017 |work=Tottenham Hotspur }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was considered then one of the best defenders in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football365.com/news/football365s-top-ten-defenders-of-the-season |title=Football365's top ten defenders of the season |date= 26 April 2017 |work=Football365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/17/arsenal-beware-how-jan-vertonghen-has-become-the-premier-leagues-best-centre-back-7085021/ |title=Arsenal beware: How Jan Vertonghen has become the Premier League’s best centre-back|work=Metro |first=Ewan |last=Roberts |date= 17 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
On 7 January 2018, Vertonghen scored his first goal for the club since October 2013, a 30-yard strike in the 3–0 win over [[AFC Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the third round of the [[2017–18 FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-01-07/harry-kane-is-back-among-the-goals-as-spurs-dispatch-wimbledon/ |title=Harry Kane is back among the goals as Spurs dispatch Wimbledon |date=7 January 2018|work=ITV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
In the opening game of the [[2018–19 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2018–19 season]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Vertonghen scored Tottenham's first goal of the season 8 minutes into the game, helping the team to a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://talksport.com/football/410025/tottenham-hotspur-jan-vertonghen-goal-line-technology-newcastle/ |title=Tottenham Hotspur news: Jan Vertonghen claims he has been converted to goal-line technology after Newcastle win |date=12 August 2018 |work=talkSport}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suffered a hamstring injury in the game against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield]] on 29 September, and was out for two months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45827420 |title=Jan Vertonghen: Injured Tottenham defender expected to be out until December|work=BBC Sports |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; returning to the starting lineup in the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] game against [[Inter Milan]] in late November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/28/tottenham-internazionale-champions-league-match-report |title=Christian Eriksen pounces to give Spurs crucial victory over Internazionale |first=David |last=Hytner|date=28 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract with Tottenham was extended to 2020 in December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46609966 |title=Jan Vertonghen: Tottenham extend Belgian defender's deal|date=18 December 2018 |work=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|last 16 round]] home game against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the Champions League, Vertonghen played in the less familiar position of left [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing back]], scoring one goal and providing one assist in a game that finished 3–0.

==International career==
[[File:Vertonghen Belgium National Team vs USA 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 2013]]
Vertonghen made his international debut at the under-21 level in 2006 and played in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 UEFA U21 Championships]].

On 2 June 2007, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|national team]] in a 2–1 loss against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. He was also selected for the 2008 Olympics and played in every match as the Belgians unexpectedly took fourth place.

In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], he began to establish himself as a regular, initially at centre-back as former Ajax teammate [[Thomas Vermaelen]]'s partner. He scored the opening goal, also his first ever international goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen: "Moeten dringend eens maturiteit tonen"|url=http://belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|language=Dutch|work=Belgiumsoccer.be|date=13 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133000/http://www.belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|archivedate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an August 2009 friendly against the Czech Republic that ended in a 3–1 loss. On 7 September 2009, in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|World Cup qualifying away match]] against Spain, he injured his toe and had to be stretchered off and substituted in the 29th minute. The match ended bad as well; a 5–0 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vertonghen twee weken uit de strijd|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/4777976/__Teen_zit_Vertonghen_dwars__.html|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|date=7 September 2009|accessdate= 13 September 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now he usually plays as leftback as Vermaelen and [[Vincent Kompany]] are the preferred pairing in central defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L’équipe-type prend forme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/sports/football/article/543707/l-equipe-type-prend-forme.html|work=[[La Libre Belgique]]|date=19 November 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was back in the starting eleven for the friendly against Hungary, a 3–0 win&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=België wint oefenpot tegen Hongarije: 3–0|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/voetbal-binnenland/aid878871/belgie-wint-oefenpot-tegen-hongarije-3-0.aspx|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=14 November 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1–0 loss to Croatia the following March.

On 13 May 2014, Vertonghen was named in [[2014 FIFA World Cup squads#Belgium|Belgium's squad]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's opening match against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], the African side was awarded a penalty after Vertonghen pulled down [[Sofiane Feghouli]] and received a yellow card. Feghouli scored for Algeria from the penalty spot,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127 Felini Inspires Belgium to Comeback Win&amp;nbsp;– BBC Sport online], Accessed 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but Belgium came back to win 2–1. He was then replaced by Thomas Vermaelen in the starting line-up for the second match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 22 June.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285242|title=Brazil v Russia|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 31 minutes, however, Vermaelen was taken off with an injury and replaced by Vertonghen.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In the final group match, Vertonghen [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team and scored the winning goal as Belgium beat [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285474|title=South Korea 0–1 Belgium|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 2014–15 season, Vertonghen knocked a child unconscious with a misplaced shot during a training session with the Belgian squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/jan-vertonghen-knocks-girl-unconscious-after-a-stray-pass-while-training-for-belgium-9708768.html|title=Jan Vertonghen knocks girl unconscious after a stray pass while training for Belgium|work=The Independent|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he injured two ligaments in his ankle in an accident while training before the quarter-final against Wales during [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and as a result missed the match that Belgium lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/30/jan-vertonghen-belgium-euro-2016-quarter-final-wales |title=Jan Vertonghen ruled out of Euro 2016 after tearing ankle ligaments |date=30 June 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven years to the day on from his international début, against the same opposition (Portugal) Vertonghen won his 100th [[cap (sport)|cap]] (the first in Belgian history), which was presented to him by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These sports stars proved that their mums are the real superstars|first=Jagroop|last=Shinbt|date=4 June 2018|accessdate=4 June 2018|work=bbc.co.uk/bbcthree|publisher=BBC Three|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/615c42f0-39be-43fb-8235-9b7ee8e9ae83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, Vertonghen initiated the scoring in Belgium’s second-half comeback from a 0–2 deficit against Japan, heading from 20 yards out to the far post in a 3–2 comeback victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live blog|date=2 July 2018|accessdate=2 July 2018|work=fifa.com|publisher=FIFA|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331551/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
