'''Héctor Bellerín Moruno''' ({{IPA-es|ˈeɣtoɾ βeʎeˈɾim moˈɾuno}},{{efn|In isolation, ''Bellerín'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|beʎeˈɾin|}}.}} born 19 March 1995) is a Spanish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing back]]  for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Spanish national football team|Spain national team]].

Bellerín started his career as an attacking winger for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and credits his development as a successful right back to [[Steve Bould]] upon his arrival at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3341454/Hector-Bellerin-didn-t-know-defend-Barcelona-schooled-Arsenal-legend-Steve-Bould.html|title=Arsenal star Hector Bellerin 'didn't know how to defend' at Barcelona|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His speedy pace, skilful [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] on the ball, and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability have also helped him in creating chances for his team. On 21 November 2016, he signed a long-term contract that ties him to the club until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.in/football/arsenal/story/3000954/hector-bellerin-signs-new-long-term-contract-at-arsenal|title=Bellerin signs new long-term Arsenal deal|newspaper=ESPN|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellerín played internationally for Spain from [[Spain national under-16 football team|under-16]] to [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels. He made his [[Spain national football team|senior]] debut for Spain in 2016 and was later chosen for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|European Championship]] of that year.&lt;ref name=Euros /&gt;

== Club career ==

Born in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Bellerín started his club football career in [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s youth team. He moved to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the summer of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/bellerin-i-m-so-happy-i-joined-arsenal |title=Bellerin&amp;nbsp;– I'm so happy I joined Arsenal |publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927152413/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/bellerin-i-m-so-happy-i-joined-arsenal |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed his first professional contract with the club in July 2013. While a youth player at Arsenal, Bellerín also helped the club to reach fourth place of the [[NextGen Series]] of [[2012-13 NextGen Series|2012–13]].&lt;ref name=NextGen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2301930/Arsenal-1-Sporting-Lisbon-3-NextGen-Series.html|title=Arsenal 1–3 Sporting Lisbon|website=Daily Mail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellerín made his competitive debut away to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in [[2013–14 Football League Cup|the third round]] of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 25 September 2013, coming on in the 95th minute as a substitute for [[Mikel Arteta]] in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] victory after a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1314/post/first-team/west-brom-1-1-arsenal-aet-report|title=WBA 1–1 Arsenal (3–4 pens)|publisher=Arsenal F.C.|first=Chris|last=Harris|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Bellerín joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on a two-month loan deal, and made his debut against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] eight days after signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/bellerin-joins-watford-on-loan |title=Bellerin joins Watford on loan |publisher=Arsenal F.C.|date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan at Watford was extended until the end of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140103-bellerin-signs-1273564.aspx|title=OFFICIAL: Bellerin’s Back|publisher=[[Watford F.C.]]|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=25 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104002503/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140103-bellerin-signs-1273564.aspx|archivedate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was recalled by Arsenal in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/11018138.Bellerin_recalled_by_Gunners/|title=Arsenal have recalled young defender Hector Bellerin from his loan with Watford|work=Watford Observer|date=18 February 2014|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following injuries to [[Mathieu Debuchy]], [[Calum Chambers]] and [[Nacho Monreal]], Bellerín made his [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut on 16 September 2014 in a 2–0 defeat away to [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29209551|title=Borussia Dortmund 2–0 Arsenal|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|first=Neil|last=Johnston|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 1 February 2015, in a 5–0 win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawkes|first1=Phil|title=Arsenal 5–0 Aston Villa|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30971833|accessdate=1 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added a second on 4 April to open a 4–1 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] despite also conceding a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] through a foul on [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32097847|title=Arsenal 4–1 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=4 April 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellerín was selected to start for Arsenal in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]] on 30 May, helping the team keep a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over Aston Villa at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name=FACup&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32856754|title=Arsenal 4–0 Aston Villa|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new long-term contract before the 2015–16 season and played the entirety of Arsenal's 1–0 win over [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2015 FA Community Shield]].&lt;ref

Bellerín featured in the following season throughout Arsenal's victorious [[2016-17 FA Cup|FA Cup Campaign]].  He played in the [[2017 FA Cup Final|Cup final]] which Arsenal went on to win by a 2–1 margin against Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WXeS3rsW1Z8|title= Arsenal 2–1 Chelsea – Emirates FA Cup Final 2016/17|website=Youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again triumphant in the Gunners lifting the [[2017 FA Community Shield|2017 Community Shield]] by beating Chelsea 4–1 on penalties.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite web|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sVwr6MxovYQ|title= Arsenal 1–1 Chelsea (4–1 Pens) – FA Community Shield|website=Youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellerín scored his first goal of Arsenal's 2017–18 season in Arsenal's 3–1 victory over [[FC Köln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41227374|title=Arsenal 3-1 FC Cologne|date=14 September 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2018, Bellerin earned a draw for Arsenal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] with what the [[BBC]] described as 'stunning injury-time strike' in the 92nd minute, having earlier conceded a penalty for a foul on [[Eden Hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;'Match Report: Arsenal: 2 Chelsea 2'. BBC Sport. 3 January 2018. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42489693&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2018, Bellerín was ruled out of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] 1st leg clash against [[A.C.

Bellerín missed out the first five weeks of the 2018-2019 season due to a calf problem.&lt;ref name="INDEPENDENT2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Luke |title=Why Hector Bellerin’s season-ending injury could not have come at a worse time for Arsenal and Unai Emery |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-team-hector-bellerin-injury-vs-manchester-united-chelsea-latest-watch-video-a8740571.html |accessdate=26 January 2019 |work=Independent.co.uk (sports) |agency=Independent |date=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given his first start of the season in a league game against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], in which he, unchallenged, suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee and was stretchered off of the pitch in the 70th minute at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. He was later ruled out for nine months, consequently missing the remainder of the season and possibly the start of the 2019-2020 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46954903|title=Hector Bellerin: Arsenal defender out for up to nine months after rupturing ACL|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 January 2019|accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal coach [[Unai Emery]] perceives Bellerín as "very mature" and believes that "he is already preparing to come back stronger than before".&lt;ref name="ARSENAL2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kelly |first1=Rob |title='Bellerin is mature and can come back stronger' |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/bellerin-mature-and-can-come-back-stronger |accessdate=26 January 2019 |work=Arsenal News |agency=Arsenal |date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GOAL2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Storer |first1=Tom |title=Bellerin mature enough to come back stronger for Arsenal - Emery |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/bellerin-mature-enough-to-come-back-stronger-for-arsenal/f8865e3f8pyg151fhuhph128y |accessdate=26 January 2019 |work=Goal |agency=Goal.com |date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
Having reached the semi-finals of the [[2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship|2013 European Championship]] with the [[Spain national under-19 football team|under-19 team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefutbol.com/en/future-theirs-hector-bellerin-speed-embodied-footballer|title=The Future is theirs: Héctor Bellerín, speed embodied in a footballer|publisher=Real Federación Española de Fútbol|date=16 May 2015|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellerín made his debut for [[Albert Celades]]'s [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] on 30 March 2015, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–0 friendly win over Belarus in [[León, Spain|León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefutbol.com/en/match-report-spains-u21-xxx|title=MATCH REPORT: Spain thrashes Belarus (4–0)|publisher=Real Federación Española de Fútbol|first=Antonio D.|last=Muñoz|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403055342/http://www.sefutbol.com/en/match-report-spains-u21-xxx|archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2016, after being named as a stand-by player for [[UEFA Euro 2016|the year's European Championship]], Bellerín made his debut for [[Spain national football team|the full squad]] by starting in a 3–1 friendly win against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] at the [[AFG Arena]] in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-hector-bellerin-makes-spain-8078047|title=Arsenal's Hector Bellerin makes Spain debut as defending champions warm up for Euro 2016 with a win|work=Daily Mirror|date=29 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he was chosen for the final squad after [[Dani Carvajal]] withdrew through injury.&lt;ref name=Euros&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36416575|title=Euro 2016: Arsenal's Hector Bellerin in Spain squad after injury forces out Dani Carvajal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unused as they reached the last 16.

== Style of play ==
&lt;!-- Do not add that he is faster than Usain Bolt, or that his 40&amp;nbsp;m time is 4.41 seconds. See the talk page for why this is incorrect--&gt;Bellerín is known for his pace, which allows him to take on opposition defenders as well as provide defensive cover. At the beginning of the [[2014–15 Arsenal F.C. season|2014–15 season]], he broke [[Theo Walcott]]'s 40-metre Arsenal sprint record by 1/100th of a second. He is considered to be one of the fastest footballers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20150513/bellerin-the-secret-to-my-speed|title=Bellerin – The secret to my speed|last=Jones|first=Max|date=13 May 2015|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like teammates [[Sead Kolasinac]] and [[Nacho Monreal]], he has received more praise for his attacking abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/dream-team/fantasy-football/8217912/fantasy-football-tips-premier-league-hector-bellerin-arsenal-game-week-21/|title=Hector Bellerin is fully fit and ready to give you a Dream Team selection headache|last=161385360554578|date=2019-01-17|website=The Sun|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2018-19 season, Unai Emery has often employed him as a wing-back. 

== Personal life ==
Bellerín became a [[vegan]] in 2017, which he credits for improving his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 January 2019|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/premier-league/dieta-hector-bellerin-para-evitar-lesiones-6725295|title=La dieta de Héctor Bellerín para evitar lesiones|language=es|website=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|publicationdate=30 March 2018|first=Jonathan |last=Moreno|deadurl=no|archivedate=3 January 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103163903/https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/premier-league/dieta-hector-bellerin-para-evitar-lesiones-6725295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
