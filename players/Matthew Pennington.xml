====Everton return====
On 21 April 2016, his loan was terminated at the minimum 28-day point due to a defensive crisis at his home club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-recall-matthew-pennington-loan-11223814|title=Everton recall Matthew Pennington|publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to be available for Everton's FA Cup semi-final against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

a recurrence of the injury in pre-season required surgery and ruled Pennington out until January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennington on comeback trail|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2017/01/09/pennington-on-comeback-trail|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=8 January 2017|accessdate=18 July 2017|first=Rob|last=Urbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;
