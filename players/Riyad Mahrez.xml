'''Riyad Karim Mahrez''' ({{lang-ar|رياض كريم محرز}}; born 21 February 1991) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]].

Mahrez began his career as a youth player for French club AAS Sarcelles. He turned professional in 2009 with [[Quimper Kerfeunteun F.C.|Quimper]], where he played for only one season before moving to [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], spending a total of three years with them, initially playing for their reserve team and then becoming a first-team regular. In January 2014, Mahrez signed for English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], helping them win the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and promotion to the Premier League at the end of his first season. In the 2015–16 season he was the [[Algerian Footballer of the Year]], the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]], and was a member of the Premier League [[PFA Team of the Year]] as he helped Leicester City win the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]].

Born in France, Mahrez made his international debut for [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in 2014 and represented them at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and both the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015]] and [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations|2017]] [[Africa Cup of Nations]]. In 2016 he was named [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]'s [[African Footballer of the Year]].

==Early life==
Mahrez was born in [[Sarcelles]], France, to an Algerian father and a mother of Algerian and Moroccan descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/letemps/140838|title=Riyad Mahrez : "On a une équipe capable de faire de belles choses"|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=6 March 2016|language=French|publisher=DjaZairess}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Ahmed was from [[Beni Snous]], [[Tlemcen District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/article/detail?id=33412|title=Mahrez honoré à Tlemcen|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=28 January 2016|language=French|publisher=El Heddaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, Mahrez would regularly spend his holidays in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/article/detail?id=4572&amp;titre=comment-la-faf-a-chipe-mahrez-au-maroc|title=Comment la FAF a chipé Mahrez au Maroc|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=10 June 2014|language=French|publisher=Le Buteur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/12/leicester-city-riyad-mahrez-father-dream-algeria-world-cup|title=Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez is fast fulfilling his late father's dreams|date=12 September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2015|author=Paul Doyle|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood friends included fellow footballers such as [[Wissam Ben Yedder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Yedder's unquestionable self-belief driving him to reach new heights|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2518566.html|accessdate=23 November 2017|publisher=UEFA|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahrez's father had played football in Algeria.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt; When Mahrez was fifteen, his father died of a heart attack. He reflected that "I don't know if I started to be more serious but after the death of my dad things started to go for me. Maybe in my head, I wanted it more".&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
Although often overlooked by teams due to his slender build, Mahrez developed ball skills that brought him attention.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

He joined AAS Sarcelles in 2004.&lt;ref name = "journey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35688719|title=Riyad Mahrez: Leicester forward's journey to top of Premier League|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016|author=Steve Crossman|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mahrez joined [[Championnat de France amateur|CFA]] side [[Quimper Kerfeunteun F.C.|Quimper]] from AAS Sarcelles, making 22 appearances and scoring 2 goals in his first season with the club.&lt;ref name="Quimper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat2foot.com/qrclubs/quimper0910.htm |language=French |title=QUIMPER 17e CFA Groupe D |publisher=Stat2foot.com |accessdate=11 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111075652/http://stat2foot.com/qrclubs/quimper0910.htm |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While playing for Quimper he lived with [[Mathias Pogba]].&lt;ref name = "journey"/&gt;

He joined [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] in 2010, turning down offers from leading French teams [[Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] to join them, being enticed by their youth system.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt; He initially played for their reserve team, Le Havre II, before going on to play 60 times and score 6 goals for the first team in the French [[Ligue 2]] from 2011 until leaving in January 2014.&lt;ref name = "SW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LFP|id=mahrez-riyad|name=Riyad Mahrez}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised Ligue 2 for what he saw as a reliance on defence and teams aiming for a goalless draw in every match.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

===Leicester City===

====2013–14 season====
While Mahrez was playing for Le Havre, English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]'s scout [[Steve Walsh (scout)|Steve Walsh]] was monitoring teammate [[Ryan Mendes]], but was instead impressed by Mahrez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City star Riyad Mahrez not target of original scouting mission says head of recruitment|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Riyad-target-scouting-mission/story-28029571-detail/story.html|accessdate=26 April 2016|work=Leicester Mercury|date=22 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129020313/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Riyad-target-scouting-mission/story-28029571-detail/story.html|archivedate=29 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahrez had never heard of Leicester, whom he initially presumed to be a rugby club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brewin|first1=Joe|title=Riyad Mahrez: The street-schooled dreamer whose ambition knew no limits|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/riyad-mahrez-street-schooled-dreamer-whose-ambition-knew-no-limits|accessdate=1 September 2016|work=FourFourTwo|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2014, he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/110114-riyad-mahrez-signs-for-leicester-city-1287938.aspx|title=Riyad Mahrez Signs For Leicester City|date=11 January 2014|accessdate=11 January 2014|publisher=Leicester City F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25639726|title=Transfer window: Riyad Mahrez joins Leicester from Le Havre|date=11 January 2014|accessdate=13 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends and family were initially sceptical of a move to English football due to its physical nature, believing that his style of play would be more suited to Spain.&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

Mahrez made his debut on 25 January 2014, coming on in the 79th minute as a substitute replacing fellow winger [[Lloyd Dyer]], in the 2–0 win against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25789370|title=Leicester 2&amp;nbsp;– 0 Middlesbrough|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=25 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making four substitute appearances for Leicester, including scoring his first goal for the club, an 82nd-minute equaliser against [[Leicester City F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|local rivals]] [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], manager Nigel Pearson announced in February 2014 that he thought Mahrez was ready to start games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26278839|title=Riyad Mahrez: Nigel Pearson says winger ready to start games|date=21 February 2014|accessdate=23 February 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester ended [[2013–14 Football League Championship|the season]] as winners of the Championship, returning to the Premier League for the first time in ten years.&lt;ref name=champ&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester City promoted to Premier League after 10-year absence|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26906091|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
