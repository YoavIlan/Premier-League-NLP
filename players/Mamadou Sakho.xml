'''Mamadou Sakho''' (born 13 February 1990) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He is known for his tackling ability and his passing accuracy.

Sakho began his career at [[Paris FC]] before moving to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s youth system in 2002. In October 2007, on his league debut, he became the youngest player ever to captain a [[Ligue 1]] club. Sakho made over 200 appearances for the club, winning all four [[Football in France|domestic trophies]]. In 2013, he transferred to Liverpool for £18&amp;nbsp;million. He had a loan spell with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2017, and was subsequently bought by the team for £26&amp;nbsp;million on 1 September 2017.

Sakho is a full international, who has previously earned caps and [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the nation at all youth levels. Since making his senior debut in 2010 against [[England national football team|England]], Sakho has over 25 caps and represented France at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Sakho was born in [[Paris]] to [[Senegal]]ese parents and was the fourth child of a family of seven children.&lt;ref name="biographie_sakho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mamadousakho.fr/fr/biographie-mamadou-sakho/ |title=Biographie 1/2 |accessdate=10 April 2010 |publisher=Mamadou Sakho Official Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312221958/http://www.mamadousakho.fr/fr/biographie-mamadou-sakho/ |archivedate=12 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the northern neighborhood of [[Goutte d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, Ervin. "[http://www.post-gazette.com/travel/20021027paris1027trp2.asp Little Africa in Paris is a continent within a city]." ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''. Sunday 27 October 2002. Retrieved 22 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Sakho started his football career at the age of six playing for the juniors of hometown club [[Paris FC]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 2002, he was lured away to professional club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. Sakho was originally a striker, but due to Paris Saint-Germain's youth team having fewer defenders than strikers, he was moved into a more defensive role.

Sakho struggled to adapt during his first year at the [[Camp des Loges]], the headquarters of the club's [[Youth system|youth academy]], often refusing to accept orders handed out by the trainers, such as when to go to bed. At one point, he was threatened with expulsion from the club due to his constant bad behavior. Following guidance from his parents and, particularly, under-13 Paris Saint-Germain coach Christian Mas, Sakho curbed his bad behavior and began to focus on his studies and football. When Sakho was 14, his father suddenly died. The resulting pain led to Sakho considering leaving football, but he later described that idea as "useless" and returned to the club after [[Grief|bereavement]]. Sakho quickly became one of the club's most sought after prospects winning numerous [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] awards during his time in the youth academy. In April 2005, he was a part of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]] team that won the 2004–05 Coupe Nationale. That same year, he was a part of the Paris Saint-Germain under-18 team that won the ''Championnat National des 18 ans'' league title, despite being three years younger than many of his teammates.&lt;ref name ="biographie_sakho" /&gt;

In total, Sakho spent nearly six years at the [[Camp des Loges]]. A day after his 17th birthday, manager [[Paul Le Guen]] called the youngster up for the club's [[UEFA Cup]] Round of 32 first leg match against [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] on 14 February 2007. Sakho started the match picking up a yellow card in the 20th minute. He played 85 minutes before being substituted out as Paris Saint-Germain won the match 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=2006/round=2366/match=85542/report=lu.html | title = AEK v. PSG Match Report |date= 14 February 2007 | accessdate =10 April 2010 |publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho played his second and final match of the season in the [[UEFA Cup]] Round of 16 first leg match against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], he played the full match in a 2–1 victory.

===Paris Saint-Germain===

====2007–10====
On 14 June 2007, Sakho signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://psgenforceleblog.football.fr/post/2007/06/14/740-mamadou-sakho-signe-pro?post_id=87615&amp;vote=yes&amp;mode=url |title= Mamadou Sakho signe pro |date= 14 June 2007 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=PSG En Force | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially promoted to the senior side for the [[Ligue 1 2007–08|2007–08 season]], despite being only 17 years old, and was assigned the first team number 3 shirt. Sakho made his first start that season for Paris Saint-Germain in the club's 3–0 win over [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] in the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] on 26 September 2007, starting in the centre back role alongside the experienced Colombian [[Mario Yepes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007/2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=T95&amp;num_ordre=2 | title = Lorient v.

Sakho's role as captain made him the youngest-ever captain of Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 17 years and 8 months and also the youngest player to ever captain a side in [[Ligue 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007/2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J11&amp;num_ordre=10 | title = FEUILLE DE MATCH 11ème Journée | date = 20 October 2007 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher = Ligue du Professionnel Football | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090524204528/http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007%2F2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;num_ordre=10&amp;code_jr_tr=J11 | archivedate = 24 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following match against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], he was named captain again and tasked with the role of containing fellow French starlet [[Hatem Ben Arfa]]. Despite Sakho and the club putting up a strong fight, Ben Arfa scored two goals in a span of three minutes as ''Les Parisiens'' suffered a 3–2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007/2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J12&amp;num_ordre=8 | title = FEUILLE DE MATCH 12ème Journée | date = 27 October 2007 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher = Ligue du Professionnel Football | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202154918/http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2007%2F2008&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J12&amp;num_ordre=8 | archivedate = 2 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the club's following match against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]], Sakho picked up an extensive injury, which ruled him out for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/gamecast?id=252289&amp;cc=5901 |title=PSG v.

The victory awarded Sakho the first major trophy of his career. In total that season, Sakho made 16 appearances.

In the [[Ligue 1 2008–09|following season]], Sakho made 34 total appearances contributing to the Paris Saint-Germain's successful play where the club reached as high as 2nd in the league, reached the semi-finals of the [[Coupe de France]], and made it to the [[2008-09 UEFA Cup#Quarter-finals|UEFA Cup quarterfinals]]. On 30 January 2009, due to his positive play and clubs from abroad constantly inquiring for his services, Paris Saint-Germain awarded Sakho a contract extension until the June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/psg-mamadou-sakho-prolonge-mulumbu-revient-30-01-2009-392726.php | title = Mamadou Sakho prolonge, Mulumbu revient |date= 30 January 2009 | accessdate =10 April 2010 |work=Le Parisien | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, he scored his first career goal for the club in a league match against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] on 14 February 2009, a day after his 19th birthday. The goal gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1–0 lead and the club went on to win the match 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuilleMatch.asp?saison=2008/2009&amp;code_evt=D1&amp;code_jr_tr=J24&amp;num_ordre=7 | title = PSG v.

Sakho opened the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]] as the incumbent starter partnering either veterans [[Sammy Traoré]] or [[Zoumana Camara]] in defense. Midway through the season, Sakho was embroiled in controversy when he allegedly slapped a ''[[Le Parisien]]'' newspaper journalist at the [[Camp des Loges]], the club's training center. Before the incident, Sakho had allegedly confronted the journalist to question the accuracy of an article he had written referring to the controversy surrounding why Sakho went to a [[nightclub]] following Paris Saint-Germain's embarrassing loss to [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lepost.fr/article/2010/02/11/1936958_un-joueur-du-psg-frappe-un-journaliste_2.html | title = Un journaliste frappé par le joueur Mamadou Sakho: "Il m'a insulté et m'a mis une claque" |date= 11 February 2010 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=Le Post | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho reportedly insulted the journalist and then slapped him before walking away. The journalist, who preferred to remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]], filed a complaint the following day with both he and the newspaper describing Sakho's attitude as "unprofessional". Paris Saint-Germain president Robin Leproux and manager [[Antoine Kombouaré]] issued an apology on the club's behalf and Sakho later apologized to the journalist by telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://fr.novopress.info/49011/psg-mamadou-sakho-frappe-un-journaliste/ | title = Mamadou Sakho frappe un journaliste | date = 12 February 2010 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher = NovoPress | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100330132226/http://fr.novopress.info/49011/psg-mamadou-sakho-frappe-un-journaliste/ | archivedate = 30 March 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espoirsdufootball.com/10364-psg-mamadou-sakho-frappe-un-journaliste.html | title = PSG – Mamadou Sakho frappe un journaliste |date= 12 February 2010 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=Espoirs du Football | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foot01.com/equipe/paris/sakho-frappe-au-porte-monnaie,46921 | title = Sakho frappé au porte-monnaie |date= 12 February 2010 | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=Foot 01 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–13====
[[File:Mamadou Sakho, PSG.JPG|thumb|Sakho signing autographs at [[Paris Saint Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].]]
Sakho started the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 campaign]] partnering with Camara in defense. He was also installed as the team's captain in the [[UEFA Europa League]] by manager Kombouaré due to the unavailability of [[Claude Makelele]]. Midway through August, Sakho began appearing in the centre back position alongside veteran [[Sylvain Armand]]. He scored his first goal of the season on 11 September 2010 in a 4–0 victory over [[AC Arles-Avignon|Arles-Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53680 | title = Paris SG v.

On 10 May, Sakho was nominated for the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award. Two weeks later, he won the honour. Sakho was also named to the organization's Team of the Year alongside club teammate [[Nenê (footballer)|Nenê]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UNFP: Trophées UNFP du football Un petit coin de paradis...|url=http://www.unfp.org/a-la-une/actualite-detaillee/cat/19/article/un-petit-coin-de-paradis.html |work=[[National Union of Professional Footballers]] |date= 22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho began the [[2011–12 in French football|2011–12 season]] as the club's first-choice captain under Kombouaré. On 13 August 2011, in the club's second league match of the season, he suffered a [[hamstring]] injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mamadou Sakho blessé pour trois semaines|url=http://www.chronofoot.com/psg/psg-mamadou-sakho-blesse-pour-trois-semaines_art17181.html |work=Chronofoot |date= 15 August 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initially being ruled out for three weeks, Sakho missed two months and returned to the team in its 3–1 away win over [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]]. He remained a fixture in the team for the rest of the autumn campaign as PSG finished the first half of the league in first-place position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le PSG champion d'automne, Montpellier prend l'eau|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2011/12/21/le-psg-champion-d-automne-apres-avoir-battu-saint-etienne-1-0_1621302_3242.html |work=[[Le Monde]] |date= 21 December 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Kombouaré resigned from his position. He was replaced by Italian manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]]. Under the helm of Ancelotti, Sakho retained the captaincy and appeared as a starter through March. However, after unconvincing performances in draws with Lyon, [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]], and Bordeaux, which resulted in the club losing its grip on first place, the captain was benched by Ancelotti and stripped of the captaincy. Ancelotti based Sakho's benching on the increased competition in the squad as the Italian preferred the central duo of [[Milan Biševac]] and [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carlo Ancelotti cherche encore son capitaine|url=http://www.chronofoot.com/psg/psg-carlo-ancelotti-cherche-encore-son-capitaine_art31086.html |work=Chronofoot |date= 9 May 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leparisien.fr"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bisevac-Alex, les deux font la paire|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/bisevac-alex-les-deux-font-la-paire-14-04-2012-1954337.php |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date= 14 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leparisien.fr"/&gt; Sakho was also questioned by club director [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]] for being "slightly overweight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le titre, le cas Mamadou Sakho, le mercato: Carlo Ancelotti dit tout!|url=http://www.footmercato.net/ligue1/le-titre-le-cas-mamadou-sakho-le-mercato-carlo-ancelotti-dit-tout_84219 |work=FootMercato |date= 30 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half, with ''Les Parisiens'' leading 1–0, Sakho conceded a penalty after fouling striker [[Nolan Roux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sakho aura du mal à s'en remettre|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/sakho-aura-du-mal-a-s-en-remettre-30-04-2012-1978456.php |work=[[Le Parisien]] |date= 30 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foul also resulted in a [[Penalty card|red card]].

On 26 May, in PSG's final game of the season having already won the league, Sakho came on as an emergency goalkeeper for the final seven minutes against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] after substitute goalkeeper [[Ronan Le Crom]] had been sent off for fouling [[Julien Quercia]] to give away a penalty.

On 2 September 2013, [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] announced the signing of Sakho for a fee of £18&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/144053-reds-announce-sakho-signing|title=Reds announce Sakho signing|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=2 September 2013|publisher=Liverpool F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14====
Sakho made his debut on 16 September 2013 against [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] in a 2–2 draw at the [[Liberty Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2422852/Swansea-2-Liverpool-2-match-report--Jonjo-Shelvey-match-match--Martin-Samuel.html|title= Swansea 2 Liverpool 2|date=16 September 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] had described the Frenchman as "a beast in training" prior to his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brendan Rodgers Says Mamadou Sakho, Tiago Ilori Can Give Liverpool Defensive Security for 'Next 10 Years'|url=http://nesn.com/2013/09/brendan-rodgers-says-mamadou-sakho-tiago-ilori-can-give-liverpool-defensive-security-next-10-years/|accessdate=22 November 2013|publisher=NESN|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 2013, Sakho scored his first goal for Liverpool in a 4–1 win at [[Anfield]] against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Late Suarez double sinks West Ham|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/150731-late-suarez-double-sinks-west-ham|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=liverpoolfc.com|date=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermittent injuries limited Sakho to just 19 appearances, however he played a key role in Liverpool's surprise [[2013–14 Liverpool F.C. season|title challenge]] where they eventually finished as runners-up in the Premier League.

====2014–15====
On 27 September 2014, Sakho was left out of the squad for the Merseyside Derby clash against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Upon hearing the manager's decision, he left the stadium. The Frenchman later apologised for his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho apologises for leaving Anfield before derby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/28/liverpool-sakho-apologises-leaving-merseyside-derby-everton|accessdate=28 December 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor beginning to the [[2014–15 Liverpool F.C. season|season]], manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] switched to a 3-man defensive line in October – with Sakho playing a crucial part.

====2015–16====
Sakho began the season as backup to [[Dejan Lovren]]. On 17 September 2015, Sakho made his first start of the season; a man-of-the-match performance in a [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group B|Europa League]] away match against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], captaining the side in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers buoyed by young team|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34286275|accessdate=18 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, it was announced that he had signed a new long-term contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sakho signs new long-term LFC contract|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/194067-sakho-signs-new-long-term-lfc-contract|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho was restored to the starting lineup and under new manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] was praised for his excellent form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ullal|first1=Naveen|title=Mamadou Sakho and Lucas have rediscovered their form under Jurgen Klopp says John Aldridge|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/liverpool-mamadou-sakho-lucas-rediscovered-061037313.html|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November, however, he sustained a knee injury in a 2–1 defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at Anfield that ruled him out for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho out six to eight weeks with knee injury|url=http://www.espnfc.com/liverpool/story/2709248/mamadou-sakho-out-six-eight-weeks-for-liverpool-knee-injury|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho was praised in Liverpool's victory over [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the Europa League quarter-finals. He coped against in-form striker [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] in the 1–1 away draw in the first leg,&lt;ref name=innes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Innes|first1=Richard|title=Twitter baffled by mystery of Mamadou Sakho's brilliance for Liverpool against Borussia Dortmund|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/twitter-baffled-mystery-mamadou-sakhos-7712052|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=Daily Mirror|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then scored a header as they mounted a late comeback to win the second 4–3.

On 23 April 2016, it was announced that Sakho was being investigated by [[UEFA]] for violating an anti-doping rule, after he was tested on 17 March following a Europa League game against Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mamadou Sakho: Liverpool defender investigated over 'anti-doping violation'|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/liverpool-france-defender-mamadou-sakho-fails-dope-test-121415361--sow.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club, along with Sakho, agreed that while UEFA were investigating, he would not be available for team selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool FC club statement'|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/218080-liverpool-fc-club-statement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, after testing positive for a fat-burner, UEFA punished him with a 30-day ban from all European football, which FIFA extended to cover all world football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mamadou Sakho: Liverpool defender's 30-day ban extended worldwide|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36188347|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016, the ban expired after the substance was found to not be in the banned substance list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/mamadou-sakho-no-further-doping-ban|title=Mamadou Sakho handed Euro 2016 lifeline after Uefa doping ban expires|first=Guardian|last=sport|date=28 May 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2016, the case was dismissed by UEFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool: Mamadou Sakho has doping case dismissed by Uefa|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36752127|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17====
On 18 July 2016, it was announced that Sakho would wear the number 3 jersey for the [[2016–17 Liverpool F.C. season|2016–17 season]], switching from the number 17 he had worn since he joined Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/228132-mamadou-sakho-to-wear-no-3-shirt-for-2016-17|title=Mamadou Sakho to wear No.3 shirt for 2016-17|date=18 July 2016|publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]]|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States, Sakho was sent home by manager Jürgen Klopp for not respecting the rules that had been put in place for the squad. Klopp revealed that Sakho had been late for the team's flight as well as for a subsequent medical treatment session and a team meal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/28/jurgen-klopp-respect-mamadou-sakho-liverpool-us-tour|title=Jürgen Klopp sent Mamadou Sakho home for a 'lack of respect'|last=Dobson|first=Mark|date=28 July 2016|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Sakho was demoted from the senior squad and thus only played competitive football with the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserves]] in the [[Professional Development League]] that season.

====Loan to Crystal Palace====
On 31 January 2017, Sakho signed with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on loan until the end of the season. Sakho made his debut appearance in a 1–0 victory over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 25 February, and was praised by manager [[Sam Allardyce]] for his role in Crystal Palace's victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com.au/news/allardyce-hails-van-aanholt-and-sakho-452654|title=ALLARDYCE HAILS VAN AANHOLT AND SAKHO|date=26 February 2017|work=FourFourTwo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Palace kept clean sheets in victories against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], Sakho was named a nominee for the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award for March&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/354749|title=EA SPORTS Player of the Month: Vote now!|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also awarded Crystal Palace's Player of the Month on March 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2017/march/sakho-scoops-mansion-player-of-the-month/|title=Crystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho has been named the Mansion Player of the Month for March|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho followed this up with well-received performances in Palace's 1–2 victory at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] over league leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and a 3–0 home win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/how-crystal-palace-falling-love-12876734|title=How Crystal Palace are falling in love with Mamadou Sakho|date=11 April 2017|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===

==International career==
===Youth===
Sakho has been active with [[France national youth football team|France at youth level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rlfoot.fr/Joueurs/SAKHO_Mamadou.htm | title = La fiche de Mamadou SAKHO | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=RL Foot | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the age of 13, he began featuring with regional youth sides playing for [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] alongside fellow youth internationals [[Yacine Brahimi]], [[Tripy Makonda]], [[Maxime Partouche]], and [[Sébastien Corchia]]. Sakho made his debut for the [[France national under-16 football team|under-16 team]] on 21 March 2006 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Germany national youth football team|Germany]] in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/292421.shtml | title = La France bat l'Allemagne (3–1) |date= 21 March 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his only goal for the team in their 1–0 victory over [[England national under-16 football team|England]] in the [[Montaigu Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/297994.shtml | title = La France bat l'Angleterre (1–0) |date= 13 April 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; France later won the competition defeating [[Italy national under-16 football team|Italy]] 2–1 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m16ans/298516.shtml | title = La France remporte la finale (2–1) |date= 17 April 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[France national under-17 football team|under-17 team]], Sakho made his debut in the team's opening match against Cyprus in an international youth tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/318468.shtml | title = La France bat la Grèce (2–1) |date= 26 August 2006 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the season, Sakho was named [[Captain (association football)|captain]] by coach François Blaquart who noticed the player's leadership skills. Under Sakho's captaincy, the team reached the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] and, later, the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] by virtue of their semi-final appearance in the UEFA-sanctioned tournament. At the U-17 World Cup, which was held in South Korea, Sakho captained the team to a quarter-final appearance where they lost to [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]] in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17worldcup/korea2007/teams/team=1888290/profile.html | title = France squad preview | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=FIFA.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due his increased playing time with his parent club, Sakho only made four appearances with the [[France national under-18 football team|under-18 team]]. He made his debut for the team on 18 December 2007 in a friendly match against [[Portugal national under-18 football team|Portugal]] and later featured in two friendly matches against [[Germany national under-18 football team|Germany]], one of which was played at the [[GAZi-Stadion auf der Waldau]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/414180.shtml | title = Courte défaite tricolore (1–0) |date=18 December 2007 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m18ans/actualite/428650.shtml | title = Succès allemand à Stuttgart (1–0) |date=11 March 2008 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with the [[France national under-19 football team|under-19 team]], Sakho's play with the team was limited not only due to his playing time with Paris Saint-Germain, but also due to his commitments with the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]]. Despite making only four appearances with the team, he was selected to play in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]]. Paris Saint-Germain, however, refused his participation in order to preserve the player's fitness with the player having already played in the [[2009 Toulon Tournament]], which was held the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m19ans/selection/332273.shtml | title = Les joueurs retenus | accessdate =10 April 2010 | publisher=French Football Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho made his France U21 debut on 19 August 2008 in a friendly match against [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/fiche_joueur/match.php?id_match=45 | title = France v.

On 8 September 2009, Sakho scored his first under-21 goal in a [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification]] match against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]]. The match ended in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/matches/season=2011/round=2000006/match=2000191/index.html | title = Chesnakov pegs back France |date=8 September 2009 | accessdate =22 June 2010 | publisher=UEFA }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he was installed as the first-choice captain of the team following the selection of former captain [[Moussa Sissoko]] to the [[France national football team|senior team]].

===Senior===

On 5 August 2010, Sakho was called up to the [[France national football team|France senior team]] for the first time by new manager [[Laurent Blanc]] for the team's [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on 11 August 2010. He didn't make his international debut in the match, but was subsequently called up by Blanc for national team matches in September and October 2010. On 17 November 2010, Sakho made his senior international debut against [[England national football team|England]] in a 2–1 win at [[Wembley Stadium]], appearing as a substitute at the start of the second half for [[Philippe Mexès]].

On 19 November 2013, in the second leg of their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|2014 World Cup qualifying play-off]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], Sakho scored his first and second international goals, giving ''Les Bleus'' a 3–2 aggregate win to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2510109/France-3-Ukraine-0-agg-3-2-match-report-Mamadou-Sakho-Karim-Benzema-Oleg-Gusev-goal-Les-Bleus-World-Cup.html|title= Sakho and Benzema ensure rampant Les Bleus complete mission impossible|date=19 November 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2014, Sakho was named in [[Didier Deschamps]]' squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy not in France squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27401306|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[FIFA World Cup]] debut in the team's opening match, keeping a clean sheet in partnership with [[Raphaël Varane]] in a 3–0 defeat of [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285092|title=France 3–0 Honduras|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match, ''Les Bleus'' were again on course for a shutout with Sakho in defence, leading 3–0 against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] when he was substituted with an injury in the 66th minute. The team eventually ran out 5–2 winners to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207|title=Switzerland 2–5 France|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=21 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakho returned to the side for the next match, helping France to another clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285420|date=25 June 2014|title=Ecuador 0–0 France|accessdate=26 June 2014|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2018, he was named on the preliminary list for the [[French national football team|French squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/12025/11376691/alexandre-lacazette-and-anthony-martial-on-standby-for-france-world-cup-squad-and-dimitri-payet-out&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately did not make the final list.

==Style of play==
Sakho is renowned for his energy on the pitch, and had [[cult status]] at Liverpool for his interaction with the supporters.  In April 2016, Richard Innes of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' described him as "a defensive maverick; a man who plays by his own rules", who practises an "often highly ''alternative'' approach" to defending.&lt;ref name=innes/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sakho is married to Majda, with whom he has two daughters, Aida and Sienna, born in 2013 and 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mamadou Sakho : Sa fille Aïda s'incruste en direct à la télévision|trans-title=Mamadou Sakho: His daughter Aïda  is shown on live television|url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/mamadou-sakho-sa-fille-aida-s-incruste-en-direct-a-la-television_a171219/1|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Pure People|date=21 January 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Tidiane, born in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madja Sakho's Instangram|trans-title=Madja Sakho's Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfk8PQDjVQ0/|accessdate=24 Feb 2018|publisher=Instagram|date=24 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Liverpool Football Club's work in the community, Sakho helped teach the [[French language]] to local children when he played for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho teaches French to pupils|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32173950|accessdate=5 April 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakho is a [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/28/world-cup-muslim-fasting_n_5538226.html|title=Will These Men Fast While Competing In The World Cup?|last=Service|first=Janet Tappin Coelho Religion News|date=2014-06-28|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
