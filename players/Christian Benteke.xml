'''Christian Benteke Liolo''' (born 3 December 1990) is a Belgian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for English club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

He began his career at [[Standard Liège]], playing a part in their [[2008–09 Belgian First Division]] triumph. Following a season at [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]] he was signed for £7 million by Aston Villa. He scored 49 goals in 100 matches for Villa across all competitions, including 19 Premier League goals in his debut season and helping them to the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], before transferring to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2015 for £32.5 million. He spent a single season at Liverpool, scoring a total of ten goals, before being transferred to Crystal Palace at the start of the 2016–17 season.

Benteke has earned over 30 caps for Belgium since making his debut in 2010. He missed the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] through injury, but was part of their team that reached the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
Benteke was born in [[Kinshasa]] in 1990. He and his family fled during the [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] regime and in 1993 emigrated to [[Liège]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Wallace|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/christian-benteke-street-football-took-brilliant-belgians-to-top-8298505.html|title=Christian Benteke: Street football took brilliant Belgians to top|location=London|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Standard Liège and Genk===
Benteke played youth football for JS Pierreuse and later [[Standard Liège]] before moving to [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]. He rejoined Standard in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/WNATb23a8af74ba369c45b1b97f597636c02/ |title=Christian Benteke volgt Bolat |publisher=Article.wn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored three goals in 12 matches as the Walloon club won the [[2008–09 Belgian First Division|2008–09]] [[List of Belgian football champions|Belgian championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/division1/standard/standard-champion-51b7afd3e4b0de6db987c419|title=Standard champion !|date=24 May 2009|language=French|work=DH.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 August 2009, he joined [[KV Kortrijk]] on loan for a season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Footgoal.Net |url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=42996 |title=Officiel : Benteke à Courtrai, Van Hout au Standard |publisher=Footgoal.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810074449/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=42996 |archivedate=10 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he scored 14 goals in the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League|Belgian Pro League]], including five goals in the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League#Championship Playoff|championship play-offs]], as the club achieved its best ever finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/analysis-liverpool-fc-match-winner-9885143|title=Analysis: Liverpool FC match winner Benteke reaches 50 Premier League goals|date=19 August 2015|work=Liverpool Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent the following season on loan at [[KV Mechelen]] as part of the transfer of [[Aloys Nong]], who moved from Mechelen to Standard Liège. Benteke's spell at Mechelen was less successful, with seven goals from 25 appearances. He returned to Genk from Standard in August 2011 for an undisclosed fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/1.1098745|title=Benteke verhuist van Standard naar Genk |date=29 August 2011|language=Dutch|work=Sporza}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to score 16 goals and register nine assists in 20 starts during the [[2011–12 Belgian Pro League|2011–12 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Players/68312/ |title=Christian Benteke &amp;#124; Age 21 |publisher=WhoScored.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beginning the [[2012–13 Belgian Pro League|2012–13]] season with three goals from five league matches, Benteke was subject of an offer of €6m from [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/29/aston-villa-genk-christian-benteke|title=Aston Villa ready to abandon bid for Genk's Christian Benteke|date=30 August 2012|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===

====2012–13 season====
On 31 August 2012, Benteke joined [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on a four-year deal for a fee believed to be around £7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stuart James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/01/aston-villa-sign-christian-benteke |title=Aston Villa sign £7m Christian Benteke but are forced to defend transfers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 September 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke stated it was a dream come true in getting a move to the Premier League and thanked the players and manager at [[K.R.C. Genk]] for his move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2196578/Christian-Benteke-signs-Aston-Villa.html |title=Christian Benteke signs for Aston Villa |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=31 August 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2012, Benteke scored on his debut for Aston Villa in a 2–0 win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], after coming on as a substitute for Austrian forward [[Andreas Weimann]]. The goal came when Swansea defender [[Ashley Williams (footballer)|Ashley Williams]] headed the ball into Benteke's path, which he then lifted over the keeper and tapped in on the volley. Villa manager [[Paul Lambert]] praised Benteke's performance on his debut calling him "unplayable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19528067 |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored Villa's only goal in a 1–1 home draw with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20014232 |title=Aston Villa 1–1 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added a further two goals to his tally during a 3–2 victory over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20053684 |title=Swindon 2–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the winner in a 1–0 Premier League victory for Villa against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at [[Villa Park]] on 27 November to continue his impressive start in [[Football in England|English football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20405324 |title=Aston Villa 1–0 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate= 16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benteke then scored Villa's fourth goal in a 4–1 League Cup win over Norwich City at [[Carrow Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20590506 |title=Norwich 1–4 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke further added to his impressive start in Premier League football by scoring two goals in Villa's 3–1 win against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] on 15 December. In addition to the two goals, he also assisted Villa's second goal with a back-heel to Andreas Weimann. [[Paul Lambert]] said afterwards that 'Benteke has been unbelievable', after already stating midweek (post–[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]]) that 'you run out of things to say about the guy, how well he's performing and how young he is'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20650106 |title=Liverpool 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around Christmas time, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager [[André Villas-Boas]] was reportedly interested in signing Benteke, referring to him as the season's "surprise package".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/25/tottenham-andre-villas-boas-christian-benteke|title=Tottenham's André Villas-Boas eyes summer move for Christian Benteke|last=Hytner|first=David|date=2012-12-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After not scoring for three games, Benteke scored Villa's first [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in almost a year in a 2–2 draw away to Swansea City in Villa's first game of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20840916 |title=Swansea 2–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded his 10th goal of the season with a 28-yard strike against [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C|West Bromwich Albion]] in a 2–2 draw at [[The Hawthorns]]. The goal was nominated for January's goal of the month competition on [[Match of the Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20996732 |title=West Brom 2–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then netted Villa's first goal in their 2–1 [[2012-13 Football League Cup#Semi-finals|League Cup semi-final]] victory over [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. However, the victory was not enough as Bradford won 4–3 on aggregate to progress to the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21022502 |title=Aston Villa 2–1 Bradford (3–4) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[England national football team|England]] striker [[Michael Owen]] called him one of the signings of the season and posted a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]] the day after the semi-final saying: 'I'm seriously impressed with Benteke. What a player.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/themichaelowen/statuses/293820156210188288 |title=Tweet |publisher=Twitter |date=23 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke continued his rich scoring form with a goal against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and a brace against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], in a game that Villa had led 3–1 at one point but eventually finished 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21137565 |title=Aston Villa 1–2 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209061 |title=Everton 3–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He racked up his 15th goal in all competitions, as well as tallying six goals in five games, when he scored a penalty in a 2–1 victory against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 10 February 2013. This was Villa's first league victory in eight games, since Benteke inspired the win against Liverpool back in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311649 |title=Aston Villa 2–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benteke scored a deflected goal in a 2–1 victory at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], scoring the club's 1,000th goal in the [[Premier League]] in the process. The following week he went on to score a goal that sealed a 3–2 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21639183 |title=Reading 1–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21724358 |title=Aston Villa 3–2 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored the third goal to seal a 3–1 win against relegation rivals [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Britannia Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21979453 |title=Stoke 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] after his excellent debut season, eventually finishing as runner-up to eventual double award winner [[Gareth Bale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22216746 |title=Carrick, Bale, Suarez, Van Persie, Hazard &amp; Mata on PFA shortlist |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April, Benteke scored his first [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] for Aston Villa in a 6–1 thrashing of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. These goals also saw him exceed [[Dwight Yorke]]'s record for most Premier League goals in a season (18) by an Aston Villa player and pass the 20 goal mark in all competitions, becoming the first player to do so for Villa since [[Juan Pablo Ángel]] in the [[2003-04 Aston Villa F.C. season|2003–04 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22244165 |title=Aston Villa 6–1 Sunderland |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May, Benteke scored Villa's only goal in a 1–2 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] but in the second half he was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for a high boot on [[John Terry]], meaning he would miss the last game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22409606|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Chelsea|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====

Benteke's 23 goals in 2012–13 led to speculation about his future, and in early July he submitted a transfer request. Villa said he could leave only if their valuation were met, but a fortnight later he withdrew his transfer request, after talks with manager Paul Lambert, and signed a new four-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23236667 |title=Christian Benteke: Aston Villa striker submits transfer request |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23383683 |title=Christian Benteke: Aston Villa striker signs new deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his second pre-season appearance, he scored a hat-trick against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in a 5–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3328995,00.html |title=Crewe 1–5 Villa report: Benteke the hat-trick hero |publisher=Aston Villa F.C |date=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730050107/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3328995,00.html |archivedate=30 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished pre-season with seven goals in five appearances, including two goals against [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] at [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3344140,00.html |title=Villa 3–2 Malaga report: Benteke double in final friendly win |publisher=Aston Villa Football Club |date=10 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814021508/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~3344140,00.html |archivedate=14 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/332352/Christian-Benteke-on-song-to-repeat-goals-feat |title=Christian Benteke on song to repeat goals feat |work=Daily Star |date=14 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2013, Benteke scored twice, once from a penalty and one headed goal via a rebound from a missed penalty, in Aston Villa's 3–1 away-win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644714 |title=Arsenal 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Four days later, Benteke scored against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in a 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/236915514 |title=Chelsea 2–1 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his fourth goal in as many games, as Villa comfortably beat [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] 3–0 in the [[2013-14 Football League Cup#Second round|League Cup second round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23776656 |title=Aston Villa 3–0 Rotherham |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued scoring, as he racked up his fifth goal in all competitions, against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in a 1–2 defeat at [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23999651 |title=Aston Villa 1–2 Newcastle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his brilliant early season form was abruptly ended, as he was injured in the next match against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. It was later confirmed that he would be out for up to six weeks with a hip flexor injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/8940234/premier-league-aston-villa-striker-christian-benteke-faces-six-weeks-out-with-hip-injury |title=Premier League: Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke faces six weeks out with hip injury |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made his comeback earlier than expected, after coming on as a substitute against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] a month later in a 2–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24510366 |title=Aston Villa 0–2 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After loss of form and niggling injuries prevented Benteke scoring for 12 games (his last goal being against Newcastle on 14 September), he eventually ended his drought against Arsenal in a 1–2 defeat on 13 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/news/12040/9096538/ |title=Premier League: Aston Villa's Christian Benteke backed to rediscover top form |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 January 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Villa 1-2 Arsenal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25617902 |title=Aston Villa 1–2 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with goals in back-to-back games against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], in a 2–2 draw and 4–3 victory respectively.&lt;ref name="Liverpool 2-2 Villa BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25693308 |title=Liverpool 2–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Villa 4-3 West Brom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25838290 |title=Aston Villa 4–3 West Bromwich Albion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having not scored throughout February, the Belgian then scored a superb overhead volley as well as a header, in an eventual 4–1 home victory against Norwich City on 2 March.&lt;ref name="Villa 4-1 Norwich"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26311656 |title=Aston Villa 4–1 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 March 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2014, Benteke suffered a rupture of his [[achilles tendon]] while training and was ruled out for at least six months, missing the remainder of the season and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/03/christian-benteke-suffers-achilles-injury-aston-villa-belgium-world-cup|title=Christian Benteke ruled out of World Cup after rupturing achilles|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2014|publisher=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
On 2 November 2014, Benteke was given a straight red card by referee [[Neil Swarbrick]] for pushing the face of [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Ryan Mason]] after Mason had stuck his face in Benteke's chest. Villa had been winning at the time, but went on to lose 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whalley|first1=Mike|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29775975|accessdate=2 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to both clubs being fined £20,000 by [[The FA]] for failing to keep their players under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aston Villa and Tottenham fined £20,000 each by FA|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29921851|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his second goal of the season against Manchester United in a 1–1 draw at Villa Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30459793 |title=Aston Villa 1–1 Manchester United |date=20 December 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took him until early March to score his next goal, a 94th-minute penalty in a local derby against rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31598202 |title=Aston Villa 2–1 West Bromwich Albion |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April, he scored his second [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|Premier League hat-trick]] in a 3–3 draw with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32126419 |title=Aston Villa 3–3 QPR |date=7 April 2015 |accessdate=7 April 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later, he equalised as Villa came from behind to defeat Liverpool and reach the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], their first for fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aston Villa 2–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32273487|accessdate=19 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May, he scored twice in a 3–2 win at home to Everton, taking him to a total of eleven goals in nine matches since the arrival of [[Tim Sherwood]] as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32460322|title=Aston Villa 3–2 Everton|date=2 May 2015|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, Benteke was announced as the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] for April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barclays player of the month: Christian Benteke wins April award |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~4699825,00.html |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512000717/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~4699825,00.html |archivedate=12 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benteke and Pearson win Barclays monthly awards |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/may/080515-benteke-and-pearson-claim-barclays-monthly-awards-for-april.html |publisher=Premier League |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the full 90 minutes in the FA Cup Final as Villa lost 0–4 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], being beaten to a header by [[Per Mertesacker]] for the third goal of the rout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNulty|first1=Phil|title=Arsenal 4–0 Aston Villa|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32856754|accessdate=30 May 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
On 22 July 2015, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] completed the signing of Benteke on a "long-term contract"&lt;!--This is Liverpool's own description of it, so it needs quotation marks, just as it is reported in the BBC article used as a source--&gt; after meeting his release clause of £32.5 million, at the time making him their second [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics#Record transfer fees paid|most expensive transfer]] ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool sign £32.5m Aston Villa striker|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33627800|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=22 July 2015|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 2 August in a pre-season friendly at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], putting Liverpool into the lead with a volley as they went on to win 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Benteke: Liverpool striker scores in Swindon friendly|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33754238|accessdate=3 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August, Benteke made his competitive debut by starting in a 0–1 win at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 0–1 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33750574|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 August 2015|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later he scored his first league goal for Liverpool in a 1–0 home win over newly promoted [[A.F.C.

After missing several games through injury, Benteke returned to score in consecutive games as a substitute on 25 and 31 October: a 1–1 draw against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Match Report|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34564965|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 October 2015|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1–3 away win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34623902|last=McNulty|first=Phil|title=Chelsea 1–3 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, he replaced compatriot [[Divock Origi]] in the first half of a home fixture against league leaders [[Leicester City]], and scored the only goal in a victory that curtailed the visitors' nine-game unbeaten run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jurejko|first1=Jonathan|title=Liverpool 1–0 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35140035|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2016, Benteke was named as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for Liverpool's [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] third round tie with [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] at [[St James Park (Exeter)|St James Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/exeter-vs-liverpool-team-news-christian-benteke-captains-jurgen-klopps-youthful-liverpool-line-up-a6803166.html|title=Exeter vs Liverpool team news: Christian Benteke the captain as Jurgen Klopp makes 11 changes|date=9 January 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2016, Benteke scored his tenth goal of his only season at Liverpool with a 92nd-minute equaliser in the team's final home game of 2015–16, a 1–1 draw with Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/live-coverage-of-liverpool-v-chelsea-sunderland-v-everton-norwich-v-watford/news-story/ead855105fd49409ddea00b7dd52a3f9|title=Liverpool v Chelsea: Christian Benteke cancels out Eden Hazard goal at Anfield in Premier League|date=12 May 2016|publisher=Fox Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benteke was often found on the bench because he wasn't fitting into [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s style of play. Because of this, he ended his stint at Liverpool after making 42 appearances and scoring 10 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/232467-christian-benteke-completes-move-to-palace|title=Christian Benteke completes move to Palace|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Christian_Benteke.JPG|thumb|upright|Benteke with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 2013]]

Benteke was a member of the [[Belgium national under-17 football team|Belgium U17]] team at the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup squads|2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] in South Korea where he played three games and scored once.&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|274008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2010, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] in a friendly match against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in Brussels after his former coach at [[KV Kortrijk|Kortrijk]], [[Georges Leekens]], became national coach. On 15 August 2012, he scored his first goal in a 4–2 win against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Since then, he has become a regular starter for Belgium under [[Marc Wilmots]]. On 29 May 2013, he scored twice in a 4–2 friendly victory against the [[USMNT|United States]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slane|first1=Mike|title=United States 2–4 Belgium: Sloppy defensive play leads to friendly defeat|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/united-states-vs-belgium/1460935/report|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=Goal.com|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored two goals in seven appearances during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/teams/player=1902165/index.html|title=Christian Benteke|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ruled out of the tournament finals with a ruptured Achilles tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=2083755.html|title=Belgium's Benteke ruled out of World Cup|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benteke returned to Belgium's squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, scoring his first international goal for two years in a 5–0 defeat of [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] on 28 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/live/day=5/session=2/match=2013931/index.html|title=Belgium 5–0 Cyprus|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2016|the final tournament]] in France, and made his tournament debut in the second group game on 18 June, replacing [[Romelu Lukaku]] for the last seven minutes of a 3–0 win over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saffer|first1=Paul|title=Belgium find best form to beat Ireland|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000448/match=2017955/postmatch/report/|accessdate=4 July 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played three more minutes in place of the same player four days later in a victory over [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ladyman|first1=Ian|title=Sweden 0–1 Belgium: Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Co bow out of Euro 2016 as Radja Nainggolan scores screamer in Nice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3655065/Sweden-0-1-Belgium-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-bow-Euro-2016-Radja-Nainggolan-scores-screamer-Nice.html|accessdate=4 July 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but took no further part as the Belgians reached the quarter-finals and lost to [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. On 10 October 2016, Benteke set a record for the fastest goal in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] match—either qualifying or the finals—when he scored after 8.1 seconds against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group H|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match]], breaking the 23-year-old record previously held by [[Davide Gualtieri]].

He was left out of the final Belgium 23-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] despite initially being named in the preliminary squad.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/amp/football/44353673&lt;/ref&gt;
