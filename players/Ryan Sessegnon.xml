'''Kouassi Ryan Sessegnon''' (born 18 May 2000) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]] for {{English football updater|Fulham}} club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 national team]].

After eight years in the club's youth teams, Sessegnon was promoted to the Fulham senior team in 2016, and made an instant impact on the team, and was considered a club superstar in his [[2016–17 EFL Championship|debut season]], which saw his team finish sixth in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and qualify for the [[2017 Football League play-offs|promotion play-offs]], where they were defeated in the semi-finals by [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. In his second season, Sessegnon renewed his form, and helped Fulham achieve promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.

Sessegnon has previously represented his country at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] levels.
