====Inter Milan (loan)====
On 4 August 2009, it was said that Arnautović was on the verge of a move to Italian giants [[Inter Milan]]. The deal had been largely held up due to a stress fracture in Arnautović's right foot, leading to a re-negotiation of the deal between the clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item302920/Arnautovic-set-for-Inter-switch |title=Arnautovic set for inter switch |publisher=[[ESPN Star]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729164353/http://www.espnstar.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item302920/Arnautovic-set-for-Inter-switch |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August, it was announced by Twente that the details for the loan had been finalised, Arnautović would join Inter on loan for the season. The deal was said to become permanent if he was to play a set number of matches.

Arnautović played with the Austrian under-19 side in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]] where he was sent-off in their second match and failed to make it out of the group stage. After scoring three goals in five matches for the [[Austria national under-21 football team|Austria U21s]], Arnautović earned praise from manager [[Andreas Herzog]] who described him the best Austrian footballer of 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herzog über Arnautovic: "Bester Spieler der letzten 30 Jahre" |trans-title=Herzog about Arnautovic: "Best player of the past 30 years" |url=http://derstandard.at/1267132294666/Herzog-ueber-Arnautovic-Bester-Spieler-der-letzten-30-Jahre |work=Der Standard |language=de |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://derstandard.at/1267132294666/Herzog-ueber-Arnautovic-Bester-Spieler-der-letzten-30-Jahre |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović played his first match for the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] national senior team on 11 October 2008 against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. He scored his first goals for Austria in a 3–0 win over [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] on 8 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria 3–0 Azerbaijan |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/299356/report.html?soccernet=true |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=5 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://espnfc.com/en/report/299356/report.html?soccernet=true |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović started in all ten of Austria's matches during their successful [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign, scoring in a win over [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] and both fixtures against neighbours [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Austria-boss-tells-Marko-Arnautovic/story-27985950-detail/story.html|title=Stoke City: Austria boss tells Marko Arnautovic 'Stoke is not your last stop'|date=14 October 2015|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=8 November 2015|first=Pete|last=Smith|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117011749/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Austria-boss-tells-Marko-Arnautovic/story-27985950-detail/story.html|archivedate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnautović started all but one of Austria's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group D|qualification matches]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], only missing the game against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] through suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Republic of Ireland v Austria Match Report, 11/06/2017, WC Qualification Europe | first = Patric | last = Ridge | work = Goal.com | date = 11 June 2017 | accessdate = 4 July 2018 | url = http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/republic-of-ireland-v-austria/7t31kmcv9nz066th7snrc66zt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored four goals in the 10 games, but Austria's fourth-place finish would not be enough for qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ – Qualifiers – Europe | publisher = FIFA | accessdate = 4 July 2018 | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/group=276493/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NFT/&gt;
