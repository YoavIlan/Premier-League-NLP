Howe said afterwards that Ibe "hasn't been a regular in the team and that will be a disappointment for him and for us.

==Style of play==
Former Liverpool manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] has described Ibe as "a really talented player with a bright footballing brain" who has the versatility to play as a winger on either flank, as a playmaker or as a striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/emre-can-remain-defence-despite-8611674 |title=Emre Can will remain in defence despite Lucas being out for up to six weeks, says Rodgers |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2015 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve McClaren]], who managed Ibe during his loan at Derby County, saw Ibe as an exciting player "like the old jinky wingers we used to get in the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/jordon-ibe-profile-why-electric-ibe-is-taking-to-the-liverpool-limelight-with-ease-10039692.html |title=Jordon Ibe profile: Why electric Ibe is taking to the Liverpool limelight with ease |first=Tim |last=Rich |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Hunter of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Ibe as an "individual of impressive pace, power and control", who produces threatening performances and stands out because of his good temperament, intelligence, creativity and directness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/12/liverpool-jordon-ibe-succeed |title=Liverpool's Jordon Ibe has pace, power and 'football brain' to succeed |first=Andy |last=Hunter |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 February 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
