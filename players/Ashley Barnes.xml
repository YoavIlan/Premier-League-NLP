==Club career==
===Early career and Plymouth Argyle===
As a child, Barnes played on a team called Bath Arsenal, where his teammates included fellow future professional [[Scott Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; He began his senior career as a prolific goalscorer with local club [[Paulton Rovers F.C.|Paulton Rovers]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. He had an extended trial with Championship club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in March 2007, and sufficiently impressed to be awarded with an eighteen-month contract by the club, having scored several goals for the reserve team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paulton striker impresses Argyle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/6347653.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Plymouth debut in the first round of the [[2007–08 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in August 2007 against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], coming on as a substitute for first-team regular [[Sylvan Ebanks-Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plymouth 2–1 Wycombe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6941834.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently found first-team opportunities hard to come by, and was sent on loan to [[Football Conference|Conference]] side [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in November 2007 to gain some experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oxford sign deadline day strikers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oxford_utd/7107832.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes featured five times for Oxford United, including two [[FA Cup]] ties against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], before returning to Plymouth. He was sent out on loan again in March 2008 to another Conference club, this time to [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salisbury bring in Barnes on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/salisbury/7285607.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in five league matches for the club but did not find the back of the net.

Barnes was loaned out for a third time in November 2008 to [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]], with teammate [[Dan Smith (footballer born 1989)|Daniel Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 November 2008 |url=http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1468498,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805150108/http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1468498,00.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=5 August 2012 |title=On the way |publisher=pafc.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He impressed enough for his loan to be extended by a month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 January 2009 |url=http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1509471,00.html |title=Loan extension |publisher=pafc.co.uk |accessdate=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430225040/http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10364~1509471%2C00.html |archivedate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he was recalled by Plymouth Argyle in January 2009, ahead of the club's match against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 January 2009 |url=http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1534218,00.html |title=Ashley called back |publisher=pafc.co.uk |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181904/http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10364~1534218%2C00.html |archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut for the Pilgrims against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], scoring his first goal for the club against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. His performances at the back-end of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]] were rewarded when he signed a two-year contract extension in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10364~1645008,00.html |title=New deal for Ash |publisher=pafc.co.uk |accessdate=14 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509085952/http://www.pafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10364~1645008%2C00.html |archivedate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
[[File:Ashley Barnes Brighton.jpg|thumb|upright|Barnes playing for [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] in 2011]]

Barnes subsequently joined [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 March 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/8587183.stm |title=Brighton make double loan signing |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/8587183.stm |archivedate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his debut against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] two days later, having been introduced as a substitute ten minutes earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 March 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8568156.stm |title=Brighton 3–0 Tranmere |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401054052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8568156.stm |archivedate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2010, Barnes signed a two-year contract with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion after transferring for an undisclosed fee from Plymouth Argyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~2086784,00.html |title=Barnes is back |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710184325/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~2086784%2C00.html |archivedate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2011, he scored the decisive goal in a 4–3 win at home against [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]], which confirmed their promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Paul |title=Brighton 4–3 Dag &amp; Red |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/12968187.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=11 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413033537/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/12968187.stm |archivedate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes finished the season as Brighton's second-top goalscorer behind [[Glenn Murray]], with 20 goals in 49 appearances.

In the [[2011-12 Football League Championship|2011–12 season]] Barnes remained a first-choice striker for Brighton's return to the Championship. He finished the season as Brighton's leading goalscorer with 14 goals in all competitions, 11 in the league.

On 9 March 2013, Barnes received a red card in stoppage time against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for attempting to trip up the referee. He was subsequently handed a seven-match suspension by [[the Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21804556 |title=Ashley Barnes: FA extends striker's ban to seven games |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans and manager [[Gus Poyet]] were critical of Barnes for this action as it left the club with only one senior striker available to play, as [[Craig Mackail-Smith]] and [[Will Hoskins]] were already injured for the rest of the season. On his return from the ban on 20 April, Barnes scored two goals in a 6–1 win over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and was named man of the match.

===Burnley===
On 10 January 2014, Barnes joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burnley sign Barnes from Brighton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25681552 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November, he scored the only goal at [[Turf Moor]] to defeat [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and gain Burnley's first win of the [[Premier League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abraham |first1=Timothy |title=Burnley 1–0 Hull |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29860234 |accessdate=8 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a second goal on 13 December, the sole goal in a home victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to take Burnley out of the relegation zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanghera |first1=Mandeep |title=Burnley 1–0 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30357668 |accessdate=14 December 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Barnes performed a high tackle on [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea's]] [[Nemanja Matić]], who was sent off for pushing him in retaliation. Barnes did not receive a booking for the challenge, and [[The FA]] confirmed that they would not take retrospective action as that was not normal procedure for attempted tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashley Barnes escapes FA disciplinary action over horror tackle on Nemanja Matic |url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/ashley-barnes-escapes-fa-disciplinary-action-over-horror-tackle-on-nemanja-matic-31014780.html |accessdate=24 February 2019 |work=Irish Independent |date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes was publicly criticised by Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], and said of the criticism "I found that hilarious".&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunter |first1=Andy |title=Ashley Barnes: ‘I got a text saying Mourinho had gone on TV to criticise me.

On 24 May 2015, as relegated Burnley finished the season with a win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], Barnes was taken off with knee cruciate ligament injuries, which would rule him out for the majority of [[2015–16 Football League Championship|the following campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ashley Barnes: Burnley striker to miss most of next season |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32908544 |accessdate=28 May 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2018, he wrote himself into the history books, scoring his 16th goal in the Premier League to secure a 2–1 victory for Burnley against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. His 16th goal, and his 6th of the season, made him Burnley's leading scorer in the [[Premier League]] since it was formed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43178518 |title=Burnley 2–1 Everton |date=3 March 2018 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/33386/History/Ashley-Barnes |title=Ashley Barnes – History |website=www.whoscored.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
