'''Jermain Colin Defoe''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 7 October 1982) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] of the [[Scottish Premiership]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]], and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Defoe began his career with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], joining their youth team aged 14, before moving to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] aged 16 and rising through the ranks. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in 2000 and, after a season-long loan spell at Bournemouth during the [[2000–01 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2000–01 season]], established himself in the West Ham line-up. After West Ham's relegation in 2003, a move to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in January 2004 soon followed, where Defoe played for four years before being sold to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in January 2008. He spent one season at [[Fratton Park]] before returning to Tottenham in the January 2009 transfer window. He left for [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) in 2014, before returning to England in January 2015 to sign for Sunderland.

In April 2011, Defoe became the 20th player to score a [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|century of Premier League goals]], and is currently the seventh-highest goalscorer in Premier League history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/8471966/Jermain-Defoe-scores-100th-Premier-League-goal-after-ditching-celebratory-T-shirt.html |title=Jermain Defoe scores 100th Premier League goal after ditching celebratory T-shirt |first=Sandy |last=McCaskill |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the [[List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. records and statistics#Top 10 all-time scorers|sixth highest goalscorer]] in [[History of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham's history]]&lt;ref name="THFC number 5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1563238/jermain-defoe-thrilled-tottenham-goals-record?cc=5901 |title=Jermain Defoe thrilled with goals record |publisher=ESPN |first=Kevin |last=Palmer |date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the club's [[List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. records and statistics#Top European competition scorers|joint highest goalscorer]] in [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in European football|European competitions]].&lt;ref name="European record"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/255547.html |title=Defoe breaks all-time record as Spurs go through |publisher=ESPN |date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe also holds the Premier League record for the most goals scored as a substitute, with 22, as of 11 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/statuses/422047620912017408 |title=OptaJoe |via=Twitter |publisher=Opta Sports |date=11 January 2014 |quote=22&amp;nbsp;– Jermain Defoe has scored more goals as a Premier League substitute than any other player (22).

Defoe made his England debut in 2004 and has made 57 appearances, scoring 20 goals, including three appearances and a goal at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Beckton]], London,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; Defoe attended St Joachim Primary School in [[Custom House, London|Custom House]], London&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blows |first1=Kirk |first2=Ben |last2=Sharratt |title=Claret and Blue Blood, Pumping Life into West Ham United |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |pages=230–234 |isbn=1-84018-489-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Bonaventure's]] in [[Forest Gate]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spencer |first=Claire |title=Why do some schools produce clusters of celebrities? |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13112311 |accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe grew up in Canning Town and when his family moved to Beckton, played [[five-a-side]] football at Newham Leisure Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newham.gov.uk/Pages/ServiceChild/Interview-with-Jermain-Defoe.aspx |title=Interview With Jermaine Dafoe: A Food And Football Revolution |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Sunday league team [[Senrab F.C.|Senrab]], well known in London for producing players such as [[Lee Bowyer]], [[John Terry]], [[Ashley Cole]] and [[Ledley King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lessons from Senrab's soccer school |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 March 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3580385.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007 |first=Sarah |last=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then joined the FA National School of Excellence at [[Lilleshall]], Shropshire, as a 14-year-old in 1997. While there, he attended Idsall School.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; He was born to a Dominican father&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/325221/Fresh-England-blow-as-Jermain-Defoe-flies-home-after-his-father-dies |title=Fresh England blow as Jermain Defoe flies home after his father dies |first=David |last=Pilditch |date=8 June 2012 |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother is of Saint Lucian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/12/jermain-defoe-tottenham-interview |title=Jermain Defoe: 'bereavement changes you completely.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Defoe was spotted playing football by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] who enrolled him at the FA National School of Excellence at [[Lilleshall Hall]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; Two years later, he took the controversial decision, aged 16, to turn professional with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], following which Charlton were subsequently awarded compensation rising to [[Pound sterling|£]]1.4&amp;nbsp;million contingent on Defoe's [[Premier League]] and international appearances.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; At West Ham, he was a member of the Under-19 team that won the [[Premier Academy League]] title in 1999–2000, scoring twice against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the play-off final.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood"/&gt;

Jermain made his first-team debut in a League Cup match against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in September 2000, scoring in a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walsall 0–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/930913.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, he joined [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[AFC Bournemouth]] on a near season-long [[Loan (sports)|loan]], where he scored in ten consecutive matches, equalling [[John Aldridge]]'s and [[Clarrie Jordan]]'s post-war record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/players_profiles/I-J/JordanC.php |title=Leeds United F.C. History |publisher=Ozwhitelufc.net.au |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe's perfect ten |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/1134420.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 18 goals in 29 league appearances for Bournemouth.&lt;ref name=sb0001/&gt; West Ham manager [[Harry Redknapp]] tipped him for stardom, saying, "He's done great. I sent him out to Bournemouth to get some experience playing league football and he's coped marvellously. To score 10 goals in 10 games is a terrific achievement. He's a bright lad who's full of confidence. Nothing knocks him, he's a typical goal-scorer. If he misses, he'll be there the next time looking for a goal. He's a kid with a big future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Redknapp tips Defoe for stardom |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1134216.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe finished as West Ham's top scorer in the 2001–02 season despite being used primarily as a substitute by manager [[Glenn Roeder]],&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; scoring 14 goals in 39 league and cup appearances, one of which was a 1–0 away win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in December 2001, as West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe stuns Man Utd |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 December 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1696344.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a further 11 goals in 42 league and cup appearances in 2002–03&lt;ref name=sb0203/&gt; but was unable to prevent West Ham from being relegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham relegated |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2978071.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 24 hours after the club had been relegated, Defoe made a written request for a transfer, saying, "As much as I love West Ham United I feel that now is the right time for me to move on in my career. This is very much a career decision. I am very ambitious and hungry to achieve at the highest levels of the game for both club and country." The timing of his request, however, drew criticism from both fans and teammates and was turned down by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe demands transfer |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3020999.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham block Defoe move |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3023583.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologised to supporters, saying, "I mishandled that move and I can only apologise. I'm young and I've learned from it. I still played my hardest for West Ham and gave them 100% and want to thank the fans for their support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe apologises to Hammers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 February 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3453503.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe began 2003–04 with West Ham but a refusal to sign a new contract and disciplinary problems, including three sendings-off, which saw him play only 22 matches out of a possible 34, led to West Ham accepting an offer from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for him in the January transfer window.&lt;ref name=Spurs&gt;{{cite news |title=Spurs sign Defoe |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3452217.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Defoe joined Tottenham in February 2004 for an initial fee of £6&amp;nbsp;million, rising to £7&amp;nbsp;million depending on "specific performance criteria", and with [[Bobby Zamora]] joining West Ham.&lt;ref name=Spurs /&gt; Manager [[David Pleat]] said, "I can't think of a British striker at his age who has achieved as much in such a short space of time. His goal record for a 21-year-old is quite exceptional.

On 26 December 2010, Defoe received a straight red card, his first of the season and first since 17 October 2009, in a match at Aston Villa; his team leading at the time went on to secure the win despite playing over an hour with ten men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/851428-harry-redknapp-backs-ref-over-red-card-as-spurs-beat-aston-villa |title=Harry Redknapp backs ref over red card as Spurs beat Aston Villa |newspaper=Metro |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe began Tottenham's [[2010–11 FA Cup]] campaign with a brace of goals in the third round match at home to Charlton Athletic on 9 January 2011, with Spurs winning 3–0, but in the following round, they were defeated by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9341936.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Tottenham 3–0 Charlton |date=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, with Sunderland lying in the relegation zone, Defoe was linked with a return to former club West Ham United.

Despite appearing regularly for England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not named in the provisional England squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walcott &amp; Lennon in England squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 May 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4983618.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe departs England Cup squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 June 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5063198.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, "I've been involved in every squad for the last two years and feel I've played a part in helping us to qualify.

Defoe was initially omitted from [[Fabio Capello]]'s first squad with the new manager insisting he would only select players who were playing regular club football.

His 2009–10 season got off to the perfect start as he came from the bench to score both goals in the 2–2 draw against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]] on 12 August 2009 and was announced as man of the match.&lt;ref name="Netherlands 2–2 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Netherlands 2–2 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8194165.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe went on to score his first international hat-trick, which was the first ever at the new Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/03/england-bulgaria-euro-2012 |title=Jermain Defoe hat-trick gives England a fresh start |date=3 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 September 2010 |location=London |first=Kevin |last=McCarra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was called up to the England squad to face [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 26 March 2011, though he served as an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9436089.stm |title=Wales 0–2 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was named as a [[UEFA Euro 2012 squads#England|member]] of the England squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Euro 2012 squad: Ruddy, Carroll &amp; Defoe in, Ferdinand out |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18081125 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe did not play for the full 90 minutes in any of his England appearances until 11 September 2012 where he played the entire match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=englandstats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/england-vs-ukraine/teams/253480 |title=England 1–1 Ukraine |publisher=Sky Sports |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe started England's first [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match, a 5–0 away win against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and scored his 17th goal for England, tying him with [[David Beckham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winter |first=Henry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9529017/Moldova-0-England-5-match-report.html |title=Moldova 0 England 5: match report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/9714280/David-Beckham-would-be-welcome-at-Tottenham-says-Jermain-Defoe.html |title=David Beckham would be welcome at Tottenham, says Jermain Defoe |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe was not included in the [[England world cup squad|23-man squad]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zwolinski |first=Mark |title=Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/tfc/2014/05/16/toronto_fcs_jermain_defoe_vows_to_prove_roy_hodgson_wrong.html |accessdate=17 May 2014 |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe believes that he "likely won't ever get over the decision", and stated, "I don't think I'll ever be at peace with it."&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"/&gt; However, he was named as one of seven players on "standby".&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"/&gt;

Defoe's form in the 2015–16 season, where he helped Sunderland avoid relegation with 15 goals, led to calls for him to be included in the England squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. He was not, however, named in manager [[Roy Hodgson]]'s 26-man preliminary squad, and expressed his disappointment at his omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dodds |first=Brian |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11695/10284868/jermain-defoe-disappointed-at-england-euro-squad-snub |title=Jermain Defoe disappointed at England Euro squad snub |date=16 May 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
After over three years away from international football, Defoe was recalled to the England squad in March 2017 by manager [[Gareth Southgate]] for a friendly match against Germany and a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39291266 |title=Jermain Defoe: England recall Sunderland striker aged 34 |date=16 March 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March, Defoe returned to the first team, against Lithuania. Ahead of captain, [[Joe Hart]], Defoe led the team onto the pitch with terminally ill child, Bradley Lowery, a Sunderland supporter who suffered from [[neuroblastoma]]. England won the match 2–0 with Defoe scoring the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bradley-lowery-jermain-defoe-england-wembley_uk_58d80d63e4b02a2eaab50168 |title=Brilliant Pictures of Bradley Lowery Leading Out England With Jermain Defoe |date=26 March 2017 |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and goal celebrations==
In a 2018 interview with Sky Sports, Defoe spoke about the influence of former Arsenal striker [[Ian Wright]] on his career, which included being inspired by his [[goal celebration]]s. His own favourite celebration is outstretching both arms straight, before stating when scoring a goal "you just want to go mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe's celebrations inspirations |url=https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/11488673/defoes-celebration-inspirations |accessdate=19 October 2018 |agency=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Defoe is a practising [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2348709/A-sinner-or-saint-Defoe-keeps-us-all-guessing.html |title=A sinner or saint, Defoe keeps us all guessing |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has adopted a meat free diet in order to prolong his football career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/jermain-defoe-on-how-a-meat-free-diet-has-taken-his-football-career-to-the-next-level-827824.html |title=Jermain Defoe on how a meat-free diet has taken his football career to the next level |newspaper=Irish Examiner |date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2009, his 26-year-old half-brother, Jade Defoe, died of head injuries following an assault in [[Leytonstone]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8018192.stm |title=Brother of Jermain Defoe killed |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2012, his father, Jimmy Defoe, died after a long battle with throat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jermain Defoe absence following father's death depletes England attack |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/jermain-defoe-absence-following-fathers-death-depletes-england-attack-7827869.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2015 |date=8 June 2012 |first=Sam |last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was with the England squad ahead of UEFA Euro 2012 at the time, and returned home from Poland upon receiving the news, but rejoined the squad on 9 June, two days before the opening match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Euro&amp;nbsp;– England striker Jermain Defoe back with team after father's death |url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/story/1093589/2012-euro----england-striker-jermain-defoe-back-with-team-after-fathers-death |date=9 June 2012 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played against France as a 77th-minute substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Euro 2012: France 1–1 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/18076341 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst playing for Sunderland, Defoe befriended Bradley Lowery, a terminally-ill six-year-old fan with [[neuroblastoma]], describing their relationship as the "highlight of his season".&lt;ref name="BBC 6 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40524081 |title=Jermain Defoe: Bradley Lowery will always be in my heart&amp;nbsp;– Bournemouth striker |date=6 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery was named 'Child of Courage' at the Pride of North East Awards in May 2017; Defoe attended the award ceremony, saying, "As a person he has changed me because of what he's going through at such a young age".&lt;ref name="BBC 19 May 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-tyne-39973584/bradley-lowery-named-child-of-courage-at-award-ceremony |title=Bradley Lowery named Child of Courage at award ceremony |date=19 May 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery died on 7 July 2017, at the age of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39883344 |title=Bradley Lowery: Sunderland fan dies after long illness |date=7 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2018 Birthday Honours]] for services to the Jermain Defoe Foundation,&lt;ref name=OBE&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=62310 |supp=y |page=B11 |date=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a charitable foundation he founded in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44417369 |title=Queen's Birthday Honours: Kenny Dalglish knighted, Anthony Joshua becomes OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 June 2018 |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
