'''Connor Neil Ralph Wickham''' (born 31 March 1993) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] as a [[Forward (association football)#Forward|forward]].

He played youth football at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] before moving to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2006 where he continued in the youth structure. He made his full professional debut for the club in April 2009. He has also played at various levels of international football, scoring the winning goal in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]] Final.

==Early life==
Wickham was born in [[Hereford]], [[Herefordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Morgan |first = Ian |title = Bright future ahead for Ipswich Town's Connor Wickham |work = [[Hereford Times]] |date = 14 May 2010 |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/sport/other/8166595.Bright_future_ahead_for_Ipswich_Town_s_Connor_Wickham |accessdate = 16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of an Army [[Warrant Officer]],&lt;ref name="Striker Connor Wickham soon to cast aside his L plates"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Lansley | first = Peter | title = Striker Connor Wickham soon to cast aside his L plates | newspaper = [[The Times]] | date = 17 May 2010 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article7128066.ece | accessdate = 18 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Philip Morant School and College|Philip Morant School]] in [[Colchester]], where he achieved eight A-C grade GCSEs – as well as being a prominent member of the school football team, where he was a prolific goalscorer from a young age.&lt;ref name="Striker Connor Wickham soon to cast aside his L plates"/&gt; He played youth football with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] for four years.&lt;ref name="Striker Connor Wickham soon to cast aside his L plates"/&gt; Wickham's father is Northern Irish.&lt;ref name="Speck"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1303333/The-Irish-coming-poaching-Connor-Wickham-approached-Nigel-Worthington.html |work = Daily Mail |accessdate = 5 February 2011 |date=16 August 2010 |title=All the buzz from the Football League: The Irish are coming poaching!

==Club career==

===Ipswich Town===

====2008–09====
Wickham made his debut for the [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] [[first team]] on 11 April 2009, aged 16 years and 11 days. He came on as a 66th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Veliče Šumulikoski]] in a 3–1 home defeat against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7978909.stm | title = Ipswich 1–3 Doncaster | publisher= [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 11 April 2009| date = 11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so he became Ipswich's youngest ever player, beating the previous record being held by [[Jason Dozzell]] by 46 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=News&amp;itemid=IPED25%20Oct%202007%2007%3A06%3A10%3A037|title=Teenage star set to shine|date=24 October 2007|work=[[Evening Star (Ipswich)|Evening Star]]|accessdate=9 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317011632/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline|archivedate=17 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10====
[[File:Connor Wickham - It 6.jpg|thumb|Wickham with Ipswich Town in 2009]]
Wickham scored his first two senior goals in only his fourth appearance, when he scored in Ipswich's [[2009–10 Football League Cup#First round|2009–10 League Cup]] tie against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. He also scored in the [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], which saw Ipswich prevail 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shrewsbury 3–3 Ipswich |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8188438.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2009
|accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first league goal in a 1–0 home victory over [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in March 2010, his winning effort coming deep into injury time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8558495.stm | title = Ipswich 1–0 Scunthorpe|publisher = BBC Sport|date=13 March 2010|accessdate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Wickham scored his second league goal, which came in the 90th minute in a 3–1 victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This came two days after he signed his first professional contract at Ipswich, a two-year deal following his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name="Connor Signs Two Year Deal"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10272~2014145,00.html | title = Connor Signs Two Year Deal | publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 4 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100602214223/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10272~2014145%2C00.html | archivedate = 2 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Wickham was named the Football League [[Football League Young Player of the Month|young player of the month]]. He won the award after scoring three goals in four matches during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=16469 | title = Wickham Young Player of the Month |publisher = TWTD |date= 17 May 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] made offers to buy Wickham, but these were rejected by Ipswich Town.&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Henderson | first = Mel | title = Ipswich wonderkid Connor Wickham passes Euro test on his way to the top | newspaper = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 1 June 2010 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1282957/Ipswich-wonderkid-Connor-Wickham-passes-Euro-test-way-top.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | accessdate = 1 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11====
Wickham extended his contract with Ipswich to 2013 in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Connor Wickham signs fresh Ipswich Town deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/9370218.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an offer clause in it which states that if any bid equals or beats the one written in the contract, Ipswich would have to allow him to speak to the bidding club. It was reported that the figure was around the £15 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Wickham Contract Has Offer Clause|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=17929&amp;title=new_wickham_contract_has_offer_clause |publisher=TWTD|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2011, Wickham scored Ipswich's his first goal of the season in a 3–2 win over Doncaster Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9365340.stm|title=Ipswich 3-2 Doncaster|date=29 January 2018|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two games later, Wickham scored in a 3–0 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at [[Portman Road]]. A clearance of a set piece saw Wickham pass two opponents before wrong-footing [[Rob Kozluk]] and goalkeeper [[Steve Simonsen]] to tap the ball into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9389147.stm|title=Ipswich 3-0 Sheff Utd|date=14 February 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Ipswich player, [[Kevin Beattie]] witnessed the goal, and described it as one of the greatest goals ever scored at Portman Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=17866&amp;title=town_topic:_the_greatest_town_goals|title=Town Topic: The Greatest Town Goals - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later Wickham recorded his first professional [[hat-trick]] in a 6–0 win at Doncaster Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11707_6771920,00.html | title = Jewell hopes to keep Wickham| publisher = Sky Sports | date = 22 February 2011 | accessdate = 22 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham's superb scoring form continued when he scored late in the match against Reading on 8 March. With Ipswich already 3–0 down, his goal counted for little, although it was once again a superb finish, as he volleyed a ball that was coming over his shoulder into the top corner of the goal from a tight angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9415246.stm|title=Ipswich 1-3 Reading|date=8 March 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2011, Wickham was named Championship player of the month for February after scoring four goals in the month, including his first professional hat-trick at Doncaster.&lt;ref name="twtd.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18009&amp;title=wickham_named_championship_player_of_the_month|title=Wickham Named Championship Player of the Month - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later he was named the Football League Young Player of the Year as well as the Championship Apprentice of the Year at the [[Football League Awards|2011 Football League Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.football-league.co.uk/flawards/news/20110320/connor-wickham-wins-young-player-of-the-year_2293338_2319366 | title = Connor Wickham wins Young Player of the Year| publisher = Football League | date = 20 March 2011 | accessdate = 20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2011, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager, [[Harry Redknapp]] admitted that his side had not made a bid for Wickham. This was despite several reports to the contrary suggesting a bid in the region of £10m had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11890_6847653,00.html|title=Harry denies bids|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Wickham scored the second of Ipswich's two goals against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the Championship, as they won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9439038.stm|title=Burnley 1-2 Ipswich|date=2 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 8 April 2011, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13012409|title=Connor Wickham extends Ipswich Town contract|date=8 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham admitted he was delighted to have signed the contract, and said he just wanted to concentrate on achieving his goals with Ipswich, rather than focusing on speculation about his future. He said:

{{Cquote|I'm obviously delighted to have signed a new contract and feel that I'm at the right club to progress as a player. After having a look over the last two years I approached this season wanting to make a real impact. It didn't start well with me getting injured but I feel I have moved forward as a player since I got back in the side. I'm playing games every week, I'm enjoying my football and the club is moving in the right direction and that's all I want.|||Connor Wickham|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18220&amp;title=wickham_delighted_to_extend_contract|title=Wickham Delighted to Extend Contract - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He scored his next league goal on 7 May away to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], making the score 3–2 in Leicester's favour.

===Sunderland===
On 29 June 2011, Wickham signed a four-year deal with [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a fee of £8 million. The fee has the potential to rise to £12 million over the course of the contract.&lt;ref name="Black Cats snap up Wickham"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.safc.com/news/20110629/black-cats-snap-up-wickham_2256213_2383586 | title = Black Cats snap up Wickham | date=29 June 2011 | publisher = Sunderland A.F.C. | accessdate = 29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite having recently signed a new contract with Ipswich, Wickham had been widely tipped to move to a Premier League club following a highly successful 2010–11 season. Although Ipswich manager [[Paul Jewell]] had said there was no pressure to sell the youngster, Sunderland's eventual offer proved too lucrative.&lt;ref name="Sunderland sign Ipswich striker Connor Wickham"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/13873800.stm| title = Sunderland sign Ipswich striker Connor Wickham| publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate = 29 June 2011| date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee broke Ipswich's record for transfer fees recouped, and broke the transfer record for a Football League player moving to a Premier League club. Ipswich's chief executive Simon Clegg summed it up:
{{Cquote|As much as we would have liked to have kept Connor at Portman Road we have to be realistic and recognise that the offer from Sunderland was simply too good to turn down.|||Simon Clegg|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10272~2383584,00.html|title=Wickham leaves Town in record move|date=29 June 2011|publisher=Ipswich Town F.C.|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903144841/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10272~2383584%2C00.html|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He scored his first goal for Sunderland in a pre-season friendly against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. Wickham made his first competitive appearance for Sunderland when he came on as a substitute in the 1–0 defeat to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Tyne–Wear derby]] on 20 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14514549.stm|title=Sunderland 0–1 Newcastle|author=Alistair Magowan|date=21 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start for Sunderland on 22 October 2011 where he helped Sunderland secure their second win of the season against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15319551.stm|title=Bolton 0–2 Sunderland|first=Becky|last= Ashton|date=22 October 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickham scored his first Premier League goal for the ''Black Cats'' a week later in the 2–2 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. The following week against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], Wickham suffered a knee injury and had to be substituted just five minutes into the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/7294582/Injury-woe-for-Wickham |title=Injury woe for Wickham| work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of new manager [[Martin O'Neill]] saw Wickham fall out of favour as he spent the majority of the remainder of the season on the bench and playing for the reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spellman |first=Damian |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/martin-oneill-challenges-sunderland-striker-connor-wickham-to-take-his-chance-8428851.html |title=Martin O'Neill challenges Sunderland striker Connor Wickham to take his chance |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham came off the bench at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the third round of the [[2012–13 FA Cup|FA Cup]] to score his first goal of the season as Sunderland came from 2–0 down to earn a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cartwright |first=Phil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20863471 |title=Bolton 2–2 Sunderland |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2013, Wickham joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on loan, initially on a one-month deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21383420 | title = Connor Wickham: Sheffield Wednesday secure loan deal | date = 8 February 2013 | accessdate = 8 February 2013 | publisher = BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 9 February, in a 2–2 draw against Derby County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311544 "Sheffield Wed 2–2 Derby"] BBC Sport. 9 February 2013.

On 27 August 2013, Wickham inspired Sunderland to a late comeback against [[MK Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in the [[2013–14 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]], scoring twice and assisting [[Jozy Altidore]]'s goal as the Premier League side scored four times in the last 20 minutes to win 4–2.

On 1 November 2013, Wickham re-joined Sheffield Wednesday in another loan move until 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wickham signs |url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/news/article/wickham-signs-1148390.aspx |work=www.swfc.co.uk |date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham scored on his return in the 5–2 win over Reading at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] on 2 November. Wickham again appeared on the score sheet scoring a brace of goals in the 2–1 win over Leicester City on 3 December. Four goals in four games in December 2013 earned Wickham a nomination for the December Championship Player of the Month award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/20140109/player-of-the-month-nominations_2293322_3610119&lt;/ref&gt; but he ultimately lost out to Leicester City's Danny Drinkwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatsleepsport.com/leicester-city/drinkwater-gets-monthly-award-1692866.html#.Us_FpPZAKHk|title=EatSleepSport|website=www.eatsleepsport.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2013, his loan spell at Wednesday was extended by a further month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25561786|title=Connor Wickham extends Sheffield Wednesday loan|date=31 December 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his parent club prevented him from representing the ''Owls'' in the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-wednesday/sheffield-wednesday-owls-connor-blow-1-6346262&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2014, he scored in Wednesday's 6–0 win over Yorkshire rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-utd/sheffield-wednesday-6-leeds-united-0-wednesday-wipe-out-22-years-of-hurt-with-destruction-of-leeds-1-6368579|title=Sheffield Wednesday 6 Leeds United 0: Wednesday wipe out 22 years of hurt with destruction of Leeds|website=www.yorkshirepost.co.uk|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, he described the win as a "fantastic team performance" while saying that he was "unhappy with my own personal performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=ConnorWickham10|author=Connor Wickham|number=422033957568651264|date=11 January 2014|title=Unhappy with my personal performance today but buzzing for @clavery13 deserved his goals!

He made his debut on 1 March 2014 in a 1–1 draw away to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at [[Loftus Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=QPR 1 1 Leeds|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26300044|work=BBC |date=1 March 2014|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Sunderland====
On 24 March, Wickham was recalled from his loan after playing four games for Leeds to bolster Sunderland's goal scoring options, with Steven Fletcher injured and [[Jozy Altidore]] badly out of form.

On 16 April, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Manchester City at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26716896 "Manchester City 2–2 Sunderland"] BBC Sport. 16 April 2014.

On 4 October 2014, he scored his first goal of the season and assisted a [[Steven Fletcher (footballer)|Steven Fletcher]] goal in a 3–1 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/sunderland-3-1-stoke-wickham-fletcher-4376481|title=Sunderland 3-1 Stoke: Gus Poyet's side grab first win|first=Colin|last=Young|date=4 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Connor Wickham agreed a new four-and-a-half year deal with Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://safc.com/news/team-news/2014/december/wickham-signs-new-deal |title=Wickham pens new deal |publisher=Sunderland Association Football Club |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |first=Stuart |last=Vose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
On 3 August 2015, Wickham joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wickham Moves South |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/august/wickham-moves-south/ |publisher=Crystal Palace FC |date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources reported it as an initial £7 million, rising to a potential £9 million depending upon his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace sign striker Connor Wickham from Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33756128|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham made his debut on 8 August 2015 as a second-half substitute in the 3–1 win at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Norwich City 1–3 Crystal Palace|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/august/report-norwich-city-1-3-crystal-palace/|date=8 August 2015|website=cpfc.co.uk|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Wickham sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of first-team action until October 2018. He did not not make an appearance in the starting line-up until January 2019, scoring the opening goal in a 2–0 fourth-round [[FA Cup]] win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2019/january/team-news-wickham-makes-first-start-in-26-months/|title=Team News: Wickham Makes First Start in 26 Months|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=27 January 2019|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-fa-cup-match-report|last=Fifield|first=Dominic|date=27 January 2019|title=Connor Wickham ends long wait as Crystal Palace knock out Tottenham|work=theguardian.com|accessdate=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Wickham is eligible for Northern Ireland, as his father is Northern Irish meaning that until he receives a full cap from [[England national football team|England]] in a competitive game he is still eligible for the national team. His progress in the English Premier League was also being monitored by former Republic of Ireland management duo of [[Martin O'Neill]] and [[Roy Keane]].&lt;ref&gt;Irish Independent Weekender Magazine 26 April 2024&lt;/ref&gt; His links to Northern Ireland mean that he also qualifies to play for the Republic of Ireland though there are no reports of Wickham having been approached by current manager Mick McCarthy.&lt;ref name="Speck"/&gt;

===England U16===
Wickham has represented the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16]] team and was also on stand-by for the [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] squad during the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref name="Profiles - Connor Wickham"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10272~46161,00.html | title = Profiles – Connor Wickham | publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 11 April 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090427135335/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0%2C%2C10272~46161%2C00.html | archivedate = 27 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the 2008 [[Victory Shield]] with England, scoring in the 2–0 final win over Scotland.

===England U17===
On 11 August 2009, Wickham received a call-up to the [[England national under-17 football team|under-17 squad]], for their three-game FA International Tournament, which would take place later that month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simply-blue.co.uk/viewtopic.php?id=826 Wickham Gets England Call]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Simply-Blue. Retrieved 13 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Wickham was included in the [[England national under-17 football team|England U17]] squad for the [[2010 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|UEFA European U17 Championship]] in [[Liechtenstein]]. He was involved in two of the goals in England's 3–1 win against the [[Czech Republic national under-17 football team|Czech Republic]] in the group stage, with a convincing performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/under17/matches/season=2010/round=15342/match=2002332/report/ | title = England flex muscles against Czechs | publisher = UEFA | accessdate = 22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played the full game in the second group match against [[Greece national under-17 football team|Greece]], once again playing well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u17s/News/match-centre/2010/Greece%20v%20England/210510# | title = Barkley banks semi spot | publisher = The Football Association | accessdate = 22 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham was rested for the final group game of the tournament, but returned to face [[France national youth football team|France]] in the semi-final. He scored both goals for England in a 2–1 victory, both left-footed, and both in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u17s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvFrance/Report | title = Wickham brace sends England into Final | publisher = The Football Association | accessdate = 27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickham scored the winner in a 2–1 victory over [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]] in the final.

Following the success of Wickham in the England youth set-up, speculation began to mount about him winning a senior cap, and possibly even being included in [[Fabio Capello]]'s [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup squad]] – although seemingly a longshot. Former England defender [[Russell Osman]] said:

{{Cquote|Of course people will question why Capello would take Wickham to the World Cup but my reply would be, "Why not?" [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] picked [[Theo Walcott]] four years ago and he was 17 with even less experience than Wickham.|||Russell Osman|"&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;''}}

===England U21===
[[File:Connor Wickham England U21.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|Wickham playing for England Under 21s in 2012]]
On 7 September 2010, England under-21 boss, [[Stuart Pearce]] admitted that he had been monitoring Wickham's progress, and that he would consider calling him up to the under-21 squad once he had recovered from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pearce well aware of Wickham | newspaper = [[Yahoo!

Following that game, and the important experience Wickham gained, he returned to the England under-19 side. However, it would not be long before he was back in the fold for the under-21s.

On 14 March 2011, it was announced that Wickham had been included in the squad for England's games against Denmark and Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=18065|title=Wickham in England U21 Squad - Ipswich Town News|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as a substitute in the game against Denmark, which England went on to win 4–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/sturridge-stands-out-as-england-romp-to-40-victory-2252547.html|title=Sturridge stands out as England romp to 4-0 victory|date=25 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following Monday, Wickham started the game in a friendly against Iceland at [[Deepdale Stadium|Deepdale]] in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. It was his first start for the under-21s, and he played the full 90 minutes as England lost the game 2–1 to a very strong Iceland side that consisted of a number of first team regulars. Wickham played as a lone striker in the game.

Prior to the Iceland game, Wickham admitted that he was hopeful of being included in the squad that would play in the summer's Euro 2011 under-21s [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|tournament]] due to take place in June. Having been an instrumental figure in the success of the under-17's the previous summer, he felt he could repeat the feat at a higher level. He said:

{{Cquote|It would be another summer tournament, and I want to win another tournament. It'll be different, but if we play to the potential that is in our team we are capable of beating anyone on our day. All the boys have taken me as part of the team and have treated me no differently to anyone else. They are a great bunch of lads and I'd be happy to spend the summer with them. Even just to be selected would be brilliant but to win it would be better. I don't see why we can't go on and really push this summer to win the tournament.|||Connor Wickham|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2011/EnglandIceland/Match-Previews/connor-wickham|title=The website for the English football association, the Emirates FA Cup and the England football team|first=The Football|last=Association|website=www.thefa.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''}}

He scored his first goal for the under-21s on 10 September 2012, scoring the only goal of the game in a win against [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norway]] in [[Chesterfield]], ensuring England won their European Under-21 Championship qualifying group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19547219 "England U-21 1–0 Norway U-21"] BBC Sport. 10 September 2012.
