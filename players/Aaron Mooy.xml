Mooy took part in his second successive A-League grand final the following season, as the Wanderers were named runners-up to the Championship for the second time in a row.

===Melbourne City===
Mooy was released by Western Sydney Wanderers on 21 May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/wswanderersfc/news-display/Wanderers-Announce-Player-Departures/90596 |title=Wanderers Announce Player Departures |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=Western Sydney Wanderers FC |accessdate=28 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521152418/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/wswanderersfc/news-display/Wanderers-Announce-Player-Departures/90596 |archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was announced to have joined A-League rivals [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] the same day. He scored his first goal against [[Brisbane Roar]], and also scored in both fixtures against his former club [[Western Sydney Wanderers]]. At the end of the season he claimed [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City's]] Player of the Year award and was the club's top scorer that season, also racking up eight assists. Mooy became the youngest ever marquee player in [[A-League]] history when he re-signed with [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] for the [[2015–16 A-League|2015–16 season]]. On 29 September, he scored a [[hat-trick]] against [[Heidelberg United]] in the [[FFA Cup]] quarter finals with two of the goals coming from outside the box, and in doing this he also became the first ever City player to score a hat-trick in the FFA Cup. During his time with Melbourne City, [[Socceroos]] manager [[Ange Postecoglou]] labelled him the "best and most exciting player in the [[A-League]]", while former Socceroo goalkeeper [[Mark Bosnich]] described him as "the best Australian midfielder playing anywhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/melbourneheart/news-display/Aaron-Mooy-joins-Melbourne-Heart-FC/90581 |title=Aaron Mooy joins Melbourne Heart FC |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=Melbourne Heart FC |accessdate=28 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521065900/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/melbourneheart/news-display/Aaron-Mooy-joins-Melbourne-Heart-FC/90581 |archivedate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne City were reported to have rejected a $2m offer for Mooy from Saudi Arabia club [[Al-Nassr FC|Al-Nassr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/melbourne-city/melbourne-city-reject-record-offer-from-alnassr-for-socceroos-star-aaron-mooy-20151210-glkg2k.html |title=Melbourne City reject record offer from Al-Nassr for Socceroos star Aaron Mooy |first=Dominic |last=Bossi |newspaper=The Age |date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 2016, he assisted [[Bruno Fornaroli]] for two of his three goals to move to 20 assists for the season; an all time [[A League|A-League]] record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/bruno-fornaroli-scores-his-18th-goal-of-the-season-to-give-melbourne-city-lead-over-sydney-fc/news-story/a16d03ebc34d9f20da5b69a10f4ba644 |title=Bruno Fornaroli scores his 18th, 19th and 20th goals of season to give Melbourne City win over Sydney FC |first=Michael |last=Puterflam |publisher=Fox Sports |date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooy was involved in the squad that won the Championship Play-off Final, scoring one of Huddersfields's four penalties in the penalty shootout against Reading.

On 15 June 2017, it was reported that Huddersfield had agreed a fee with Manchester City to sign Mooy on a permanent basis.

Mooy made his [[Premier League]] debut for Huddersfield in their first game of the [[2017–18 Premier League|2017–18 season]], a 3–0 win over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], Mooy himself involved in two of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/08/13/mooy-assist-mode-huddersfield-thump-palace |title=Mooy in assist mode as Huddersfield thump Palace |website=The World Game |publisher=SBS |date=13 August 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first Premier League goal one week later, the only goal of the game as Huddersfield defeated [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40914669 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Huddersfield Town 1–0 Newcastle United |date=20 August 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2017, Mooy scored the opening goal as Huddersfield upset [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–1 in a Premier League clash at [[Kirklees Stadium|John Smith's Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-22/mooy-the-man-as-huddersfield-shock-manchester-united/9074026?section=sport |title=Aaron Mooy scores as Huddersfield shocks Manchester United |publisher=ABC News |date=22 October 2017 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Cameroon-Australia (21) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Mooy playing for [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in 2017]]

Mooy was eligible to represent [[Germany national football team|Germany]] or the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] through his parents.&lt;ref name="adelaidenow.com.au"/&gt;

Mooy made 10 appearances for the [[Young Socceroos]] between 2008 and 2009 and scored four goals. He played at the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and played in two group stage games before Australia were eliminated, scoring in his second game against [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]]. He was called up to the senior [[Socceroos|Australian]] side in August 2009, for a friendly match against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100196:australia-squad-named-for-ireland-friendly&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Australia squad named for Ireland friendly |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Mooy declared his desire to play for [[Australia Olympic football team|Australia]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=St Mirren kid Aaron Mooy: I'd love to be part of Australia's 2012 Olympic squad |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/st-mirren-kid-aaron-mooy-1089810 |newspaper=Daily Record |date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were unsuccessful in their [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's Asian Qualifiers|qualifying campaign]] for [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|London 2012]].

On 7 December 2012, he made his international debut with the [[Australia national soccer team|Socceroos]] against [[Guam national football team|Guam]] scoring a free-kick to open the scoring in a game the Socceroos would win 9–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aaron Mooy scores on Socceroo Debut |url=http://www.westsydneyfootball.com/_/player-articles/aaron-mooy-scores-on-socceroo-debut-r240 |publisher=Western Sydney Football |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following game against [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]], Mooy again scored a free-kick as the Socceroos won 8–0 and qualified for the [[EAFF East Asian Cup]].

On 11 March 2015, Mooy was selected in a squad to play [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. On 3 September 2015, he scored the fifth goal in a 5–0 defeat of [[Bangladesh national football team|Bangladesh]] in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] in Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australia put five past Bangladesh in second straight WC qualifier as well as another against Jordan later in qualifying. win |url=http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-afc/match/433434/australia-bangladesh/report |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=3 September 2015 |date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also holds a Dutch passport due to his mother's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lntup.com/2017/06/30/huddersfield-town-permanently-sign-aaron-mooy/ |title=Huddersfield Town permanently sign Aaron Mooy |date=30 June 2017|access-date=25 November 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201054434/https://www.lntup.com/2017/06/30/huddersfield-town-permanently-sign-aaron-mooy/ |archivedate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
