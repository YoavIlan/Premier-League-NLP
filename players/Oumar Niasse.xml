'''El Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse''' (born 18 April 1990) is a Senegalese professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]]. 

Niasse has played top-flight football in Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Russia and England. He won the 2011 [[Senegal Premier League]] with [[US Ouakam|Ouakam]] and scored in [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]]'s win in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final]]. He signed for Everton for a £13.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee in 2016. Niasse made his full international debut for Senegal in 2013.

==Club career==
===Ouakam===
Born in [[Ouakam]], [[Dakar Department]], Niasse began his football career with hometown club [[US Ouakam]] in the second tier. He signed his first professional contract with Ouakam in 2008 and in the 2008–09 season helped his team win the Second League title by scoring 21 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2014/01/09/gol-silahi-oumar-niasse-350690|title=Gol silahı Oumar Niasse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing as a winger, Niasse also played a key role in Ouakam winning the [[Senegal Premier League]] title in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oumar Niasse: Meet the hard-working Senegalese striker wanted in England|url = http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/oumar-niasse-meet-hard-working-senegalese-striker-wanted-england#:0solhCmynml5YA|website = FourFourTwo|accessdate = 2 February 2016|date = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niasse started a trial with Norwegian club [[SK Brann|Brann]] in February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ba.no/sport/fotball/brann/article5907691.ece Han kan være Branns nye kantspiller] ba.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after impressing signed for the club on a six-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece Doddo-bloggen: Signér Niasse!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212095503/http://fotball.aftenposten.no/blogg/doddo/article223554.ece |date=12 February 2012 }} aftenposten.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ – Er her for å bli bedre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120223060545/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/er-her-for-a-bli-bedre/ |date=23 February 2012 }} brann.no {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Norway was hampered by poor form and injuries, and he returned to Senegal after playing just three [[Tippeligaen]] matches.

===Akhisar Belediyespor===
After a trial period with French club [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]], Niasse was offered a contract to join the club but refused the offer.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} He joined the summer camp of Turkish [[Süper Lig]] club [[Akhisar Belediyespor]] and signed permanently with them in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yazete.com/spor/akhisarda-oumar-niasse-de-tamam-660796.html|title=Akhisar'da Oumar Niasse de tamam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/2013/08/08/akhisara-senegalli-328718|title=Akhisar'a Senegalli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse scored on his debut in Turkey and ultimately finished the season with 15 goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Lokomotiv Moscow===
[[File:Loco-Terec (4).jpg|thumb|Niasse in action for Lokomotiv against [[FC Akhmat Grozny|Terek Grozny]] in October 2014]]
Before the 2014–15 season, Niasse signed with Russian club [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] in July 2014 for a €5.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref name="sway" /&gt;  He scored Lokomotiv's equalising goal in the [[2015 Russian Cup Final|Russian Cup Final]] against [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] on 21 May 2015 as his side went on to win 3–1 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/05/21/russia/cup/fk-lokomotiv-moscow/fc-kuban-krasnodar/2031399/ |accessdate=12 January 2016 |title=Lokomotiv Moskva vs. Kuban' Krasnodar 3 – 1 |website=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
Niasse joined English [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 1 February 2016 for a transfer fee of approximately £13.5&amp;nbsp;million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Everton F.C.]]|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2016/02/01/niasse-completes-13-5-move|title=Niasse Completes £13.5m Move|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/oumar-niasse-everton-lokomotiv-moscow-premier-league|title=Everton poised to sign Lokomotiv Moscow's Oumar Niasse for £13.5m|first=David|last=Hytner|date=30 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] on 20 February 2016, entering as an 80th-minute substitute for striker [[Romelu Lukaku]]. 

After 152 minutes of football in his first season at the club, Niasse was not given a squad number for the following 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/03/premier-league-2016-17-preview-everton|title=Premier League 2016–17 Preview Everton|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was informed by then-Everton manager [[Ronald Koeman]] he would need to search for a new club during the summer 2016 transfer window, saying, "[I]f Niasse likes to play football he needs to leave Everton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bascombe|first1=Chris|title=Everton manager Ronald Koeman tells Oumar Niasse to find another club – just six months after his arrival|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/18/everton-manager-ronald-koeman-tells-oumar-niasse-to-find-another/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, following the close of the transfer deadline for loaning and signing players in England, he was listed as part of the 25-man Everton squad for the 2016–17 season submitted on 1 September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Ian|title=Oumar Niasse included in Everton's Premier League squad|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/oumar-niasse-included-evertons-premier-11831437|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually issued squad number 24. 

In October 2016, Niasse was demoted to the under-23 squad and had his personal locker revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez|title=Everton’s Oumar Niasse: ‘It’s really sad.

====Loan to Hull City====
On 13 January 2017, Niasse signed a loan contract with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] until the end of the 2016–17 season with an option for a £10&amp;nbsp;million permanent transfer from Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =David|last=Anderson |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-flop-oumar-niasse-joins-9615346|title=Everton flop Oumar Niasse joins Hull on loan with view to permanent £10m switch |date=13 January 2017 |newspaper=The Mirror|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hull City sign Oumar Niasse on loan and Evandro for undisclosed fee |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38611524 |newspaper=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut the next day as an 83rd-minute substitute for [[Abel Hernández]] in a 3–1 home win against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38539371  | title = Hull City 3–1 Bournemouth | date = 14 January 2017 | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for Hull and in English football came on 26 January in the [[EFL Cup]] semi-final second leg against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he made his first start for the club. Hull won the second leg 2–1 but ultimately lost the tie 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38672990|title=Hull City 2–1 Manchester United (Agg: 2–3)|date=26 January 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Niasse scored his first Premier League goal in a 2–0 victory against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 4 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Return to Everton====
After returning to Everton, Niasse made his first appearance since his return as a substitute in the [[2017–18 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] third round match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 20 September 2017, scoring Everton's third goal of a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249724|title= Everton 3–0 Sunderland|accessdate = 21 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Ronald Koeman named Niasse in Everton's 25-man Premier League squad upon his return from loan and consequently issued him a squad number. However, Koeman omitted Niasse from Everton's [[UEFA Europa League]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/everton-ronald-koeman-europa-league|title=Everton’s Koeman has no regrets over Oumar Niasse’s Europa League snub|work=The Guardian|date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September, Niasse scored two goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–1 Premier League win, helping Everton to come back from a goal down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41290322|title= Everton 2–1 Bournemouth|accessdate = 23 September 2017|newspaper= BBC Sport|date= 23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November, Niasse scored Everton's first goal in a 3–2 home win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], having been losing 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41792811|title=Everton 3–2 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, he scored in a 2–2 draw away to bottom side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41951923|title=Crystal Palace 2–2 Everton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niasse sparked controversy in the match by appearing to dive to win Everton a penalty, which was converted by [[Leighton Baines]] to make the score 1–1 in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/oumar-niasse-facing-retrospective-diving-ban-after-winning-contentious-penalty-at-crystal-palace-a3695611.html|title=Oumar Niasse facing retrospective diving ban after winning contentious penalty at Crystal Palace|work=London Evening Standard|date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became the first Premier League player to be charged with "successful deception of a match official" under [[The Football Association]]'s new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42066734|title=Oumar Niasse: Everton striker charged for dive against Crystal Palace|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton appealed the verdict, but the FA rejected the appeal and Niasse received a two-match suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11671/11138846/evertons-oumar-niasse-has-appeal-to-simulation-ban-rejected-by-fa|title=Niasse given two-match ban for diving|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 November 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
