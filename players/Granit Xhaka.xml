Before making his international debut for [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or [[Albania national football team|Albania]], and he complained to the Albanian sports media that [[FSHF]] was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.&lt;ref name=Albaniasoccer1&gt;{{cite news |last=Begu |first=Yll |title=Në fokus / Granit Xhaka: Dua të luaj për Shqipërinë, por mungon interesimi i FSHF-së! |url=http://www.albaniasoccer.com/lajme/shqiperi/kombetarja/4627-ne-fokus--granit-xhaka-dua-te-luaj-per-shqiperine-por-mungon-interesimi-i-fshf-se.html |date=13 April 2011 |quote="Mesfushori i Bazelit, Granit Xhaka, së bashku me vëllanë e tij, Taulantin, kanë dëshirë për t'u bërë pjesë e kombëtares shqiptare, mirëpo deri më tash nuk kanë parë kurrfarë interesimi nga Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit që t'i afrojë ata në kombëtaren kuqezi.", further in the article Xhaka says: "“Në javët e fundit është bërë një presion i madh drejt nesh nga mediet lokale për të zgjedhur kombëtaren e Zvicrës dhe e kam të vështirë ta kuptoj përse askush nga FSHF-ja nuk ka reaguar për të shprehur interesim që ne të vishemi kuqezi”, ka theksuar Granit Xhaka.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka debuted for Switzerland at [[Wembley Stadium]] against [[England national football team|England]] in a 2–2 [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualification]] draw on 4 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Fulldebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://football.uk.reuters.com/leagues/uk/news/2011/06/04/LDE7530D0.php | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104620/http://football.uk.reuters.com/leagues/uk/news/2011/06/04/LDE7530D0.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 11 March 2012 |title=Below-par England salvage draw with Switzerland |agency=Reuters |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |last=Collett |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2011, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] at the [[Stade Josy Barthel]].&lt;ref name="sfv 3"&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.football.ch/nm/de/A_Team-telegramm.aspx?tg=1921952 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130115214415/http://www.football.ch/nm/de/A_Team-telegramm.aspx?tg=1921952 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 January 2013 |title=Matchtelegram Luxembourg-Schweiz |publisher=football.ch |accessdate=15 November 2011 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland also tried to select Xhaka to participate in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics - Men's tournament|2012 Olympic Football tournament]], but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/09/oly-socc-swiss-squad-idUSB29215720120709 |title=Olympics-Shaqiri, Xhaka excluded from Swiss soccer squad |agency=Reuters |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in all ten of Switzerland's [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign]] matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]].&lt;ref name=fifa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=311558/played-matches.html |title=Granit XHAKA |accessdate=21 June 2014 |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] squad by national coach [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/switzerland/10810381/Switzerland-World-Cup-2014-squad.html |title=Switzerland World Cup 2014 squad |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285207 |title=Switzerland 2–5 France |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=21 June 2014 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his brother [[Taulant Xhaka|Taulant]] while their mother watched from the crowd in a T-shirt blending the two nations' flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gill |first1=Kieran |title=Granit and Taulant Xhaka go head to head at Euro 2016... as their mother wears a half-and-half Switzerland-Albania shirt and older brother throws a tantrum on the touchline |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3636643/Granit-Taulant-Xhaka-head-head-Euro-2016-mother-wears-half-half-Switzerland-Albania-shirt-older-brother-throws-tantrum-touchline.html |accessdate=11 June 2016 |work=Daily Mail |date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted the [[man of the match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Atkin |first1=John |title=Switzerland hold on against ten-man Albania |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000448/match=2017878/postmatch/report/index.html |accessdate=25 June 2016 |publisher=UEFA |date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the round of 16 with a loss to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at the [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]]; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]], shooting wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brassell |first1=Andy |title=Poland hold nerve after Switzerland's Granit Xhaka blazes penalty wide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/25/switzerland-poland-euro-2016-match-report |accessdate=25 June 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup qualifiers]], there was speculation that Xhaka could switch his allegiance to represent [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], which had been accepted as a full member of [[FIFA]] and were allowed to play competitive matches for the first time. Xhaka, however, published an open letter stating that his participation in Euro 2016 had disqualified him from changing his allegiance, and he was thus tied to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://talentet.eu/2016/08/30/leter-e-hapur-nga-granit-xhaka/ |title=Letër e hapur nga Granit XHAKA – TALENTËT |website=talentet.eu|access-date=6 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905024345/http://talentet.eu/2016/08/30/leter-e-hapur-nga-granit-xhaka/|archive-date=5 September 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhaka was named in manager [[Vladimir Petković]]'s 23-man Swiss squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2018 World Cup: Switzerland name Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri in squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44360966 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, he equalised with a long-range strike as the Swiss came from behind to defeat [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] 2–1 in their second game.
