Phil McNulty of BBC Sport stated that, on the night, Winks was "England's best performer. Neat and tidy and almost scored. Eye-catching among so much mediocrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Lithuania 0–1 England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41457291 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 October 2017 |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winks missed the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] due to injury, but returned to the England squad in the [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League]] away match against Spain. He helped England to a 3–2 win, the first competitive home defeat for Spain since 2003 and England's first win in Spain in 31 years, in what was judged a "self-assured" performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/10/15/harry-winksproves-has-exactly-kind-quality-england-side-needs/ |title=Harry Winks proves he has exactly the kind of quality this England side needs – sharp, self-assured and aggressive |first=Jason |last=Burt |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has said "When we talk about midfielders – because you like to use Spanish midfielders like [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta|(Andres) Iniesta]] – he's like this type of player",&lt;ref name = "Winks Wonder"&gt;{{cite news |title=WINKS WONDER: Harry Winks ‘like Barcelona legends Andres Iniesta and Xavi’ but Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham midfielder must focus on football |work=Talksport |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |url=https://talksport.com/football/422282/tottenham-spurs-winks-iniesta-xavi-injury/}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing Winks as "completely different to our other midfielders like [[Victor Wanyama]], [[Eric Dier]], [[Mousa Dembélé (Belgian footballer)|Mousa Dembélé]] and [[Moussa Sissoko]]. He has qualities to add to the team that are completely different".&lt;ref name="unlock" /&gt; ''[[Talksport]]'' remarked that following his breakthrough for club and country, Winks was "seen as a potential difference-maker for the Three Lions due to his very individual skill set", with Winks earning comparisons with foreign midfielders rather than his English contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Winks Wonder" /&gt; 

Ex-England and Spurs midfielder [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] said in September 2018 that the England team should be built around Winks, citing his performance for Tottenham against Real Madrid in the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage]] as evidence: "The one who I think has got the capability, more than anyone else I have seen, is [Harry] Winks. What he showed in that game in Madrid, in both games when he was fit and at it, was a confidence and an ability to play. To see the passes, to get his foot in and be disciplined and mix that mix of midfield talent that you need [...] for me, Winks is one of the best I've seen when he's at it – in terms of his all-round ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TALENT: Tottenham Hotspur starlet Harry Winks can solve England's midfield problem, says former Liverpool man Danny Murphy |first=Joe |last=Coleman |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=Talksport |url=https://talksport.com/football/420735/tottenham-hotspur-harry-winks-can-solve-englands-midfield-liverpool-danny-murphy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ESPN FC]]''{{'}}s Ben Pearce opined in 2018: "England are still missing a [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]] [...] Those wondering who could possibly fill the void have obviously forgotten Winks, who excels at keeping possession with quick, short passes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Winks ready to revitalise creaking Spurs midfield after long injury layoff |date=13 September 2018 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |first=Ben |last=Pearce |work=ESPN FC |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/tottenham-hotspur/367/blog/post/3631601/harry-winks-ready-to-revitalise-creaking-spurs-midfield-after-long-injury-layoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
