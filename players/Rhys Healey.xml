His prolific form saw him attract the attention of several clubs and Healey spent time on trial with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref name=HealeySpeaks/&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 28 January 2013, he signed for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City sign Connah's Quay Nomads striker Rhys Healey|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/21185153|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 he signed a new contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City starlet Rhys Healey agrees new contract at the club|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11704/9212391/transfer-news-cardiff-city-starlet-rhys-healey-agrees-new-contract-at-the-club|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2014, he made his first-team debut, on the last day of the season, in a 2–1 defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as a substitute in place of [[Craig Bellamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff 1–2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27273463|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healey signed on loan for [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on 19 September 2014. He joined the club as back-up to first choice striker [[Freddie Sears]], initially signing until 20 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.greenun24.co.uk/colchester-united/colchester_united_snap_up_striker_rhys_healy_on_loan_deal_1_3777457 | title=Colchester United snap up striker Rhys Healey on loan deal |publisher=East Anglian Daily Times |location=East Anglia |last=Marston |first=Carl |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Healey made his debut, coming on as a substitute in the second half, and scored in a 3–0 win over [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe]], which was followed with another in the next game, in a 4–2 loss against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crewe Alexandra 0–3 Colchester United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289636|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preston North End 4–2 Colchester United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29388806|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having made ten appearance and scored four times so far, Healey loan spell with Colchester United was extended further until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/cardiff-city-loanee-rhys-healey-will-be-with-colchester-united-until-the-end-of-the-season-2153198.aspx |title=Rhys To Stay With U's |publisher=Colchester United F.C. |accessdate=20 December 2014 |date=19 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220235003/http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/cardiff-city-loanee-rhys-healey-will-be-with-colchester-united-until-the-end-of-the-season-2153198.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2014 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19 March 2015, Healey was recalled by his parent club Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/colchester-united-cardiff-city-rhys-healey-2345931.aspx|title=Cardiff recall Healey |publisher=Colchester United|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2015, in a bizarre turn of events, Healey was re-loaned to Colchester United as a protracted loan move to [[Football League Two|League 2]] team [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] fell through after the move was blocked by [[FIFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/article/healey-to-complete-colchester-loan-spell-2373238.aspx|title=HEALEY TO COMPLETE COLCHESTER LOAN SPELL |publisher=Cardiff City|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision that was branded ''unbelievable'' by Newport manager [[Jimmy Dack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/12869303.Exiles_still_angry_at_failure_to_sign_Cardiff_City_striker_Rhys_Healey/ |title=Exiles still angry at failure to sign Cardiff City striker Rhys Healey |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2015, Healey signed for [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on loan until January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHYS SIGNS ON LOAN|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/rhys-signs-on-loan|publisher=Dundee F.C.|date=1 September 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of 7 appearances for the club, scoring once during a 2–1 defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], before his loan spell was ended early following an injury.

On 31 August 2016, Healey joined Newport County on loan until 3 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/14715569.Cardiff_City_starlet_signs_for_Newport_County/ |title=Cardiff City starlet signs for Newport County |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Newport on 10 September 2016 in [[Football League Two|League Two]] during a 2–2 draw with [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] as a second-half substitute in place of [[Jon Parkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37263649 |title=Newport 2–2 Cheltenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 September 2016 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Newport on 24 September 2016 in a 2–1 defeat to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37394542 |title=Newport County 1–2 Cambridge United |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Cardiff at the end of his loan spell, making his final appearance for Newport in a 2–1 defeat to [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 2 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/football/newportcounty/14998917.Newport_County_boss_targets_defenders_ahead_of_Saturday/ |title=Graham Westley expects more new arrivals before Stevenage trip |publisher=South Wales Argus |first=Andrew |last=Penman |date=3 January 2017 |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon on returning, Healey found himself placed on the bench for Cardiff City for the first time in 3 years against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. On 21 January, he scored the winner against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]], also his first for the Bluebirds, after replacing [[Junior Hoilett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 1–0 Burton Albion |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38619297 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2017 |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his second start for the club against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 18 February, Healey was forced off after suffering a serious knee injury, which ruled him out for up to nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhys Healey: Cardiff City striker set for long lay-off with knee injury |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39016927 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2017 |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his recovery from the injury, Healey signed a new two and a half year deal at Cardiff, before making his first team return on 26 December 2017, coming on for [[Loïc Damour]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City striker Rhys Healey signs new contract with the Bluebirds |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-striker-rhys-healey-13825404 |publisher=Wales Online |date=30 October 2017 |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City 2–4 Fulham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42406713 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 December 2017 |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan in March 2018 for the remainder of the 2017–18 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43435720 |title=Rhys Healey: Cardiff City striker joins National League side Torquay United on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2018 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring six times in eight appearances including a hat-trick during a 4–3 defeat to [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43767134 |title=Torquay United 3–4 Guiseley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2018 |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
