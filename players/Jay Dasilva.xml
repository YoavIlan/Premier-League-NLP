==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Dasilva joined Chelsea from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in 2012, aged just thirteen, along with his brothers Cole and Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088254/Jay-Rio-Cole-Dasilva-Footballing-brothers-aged-just-12-13-signed-Chelsea.html|title=Now that's a hat-trick! The three footballing brothers aged just 12 and 13 signed by Chelsea in deal that could net their club £1m|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2017|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly integrated into the club's youth setup, making his under-18 debut as an under-15 the following year. The following season, he made 23 appearances for the youth team, including scoring in the [[2013–14 FA Youth Cup]] final first leg against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2615464/Fulham-3-Chelsea-2-Charly-Musondas-late-strike-boosts-Blues-Youth-Cup-final.html|title=Fulham 3 Chelsea 2: Charly Musonda's late strike boosts Blues in Youth Cup final|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=14 January 2017|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second full season with the under-18s, Dasilva won the [[2014–15 FA Youth Cup]], as well as the [[2014–15 UEFA Youth League]], playing all but one game in the UEFA Youth League. He signed his first professional contract in July 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squawka.com/news/chelsea-sign-jay-dasilva-to-a-professional-contract/415188|title=Chelsea sign Jay Da Silva to a professional contract|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=Squawka}}&lt;/ref&gt; having forced himself into Chelsea's under-21 side, where he established himself as a key player over the next year. He became one of the only players in history to win three [[FA Youth Cup]]s, alongside teammate [[Jake Clarke-Salter]] and five of the famed [[Busby Babes]], when he was part of the Chelsea side that lifted the [[2015–16 FA Youth Cup]].&lt;ref name="Chelsea Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/on-loan-players/jay-dasilva.html|title=Jay Dasilva|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=Chelsea F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Chelsea side that claimed the [[2015–16 UEFA Youth League]], however he was an unused substitute in the final victory against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000699/match=2019575/index.html|title=Chelsea defeat Paris to retain Youth League title|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
