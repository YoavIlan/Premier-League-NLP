On 16 August, he made his competitive debut in the final qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], as a 55th-minute substitute for the injured left-back [[Johan Djourou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/8704465/Arsenal-1-Udinese-0-match-report.html |title=Arsenal 1 Udinese 0: match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], four days later, starting at right back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1112/post/first-team/arsenal-0-0-liverpool-match-report |title=Arsenal 0–2 Liverpool – Match Report |first=Richard |last=Clarke |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=20 August 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson kept his place in the team, starting in the second leg against Udinese&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt; and then in an eventful Premier League fixture against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].

With Sagna still unavailable through injury, Jenkinson was a regular starter in the first couple of months of the [[2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season|2012–13 season]]. His performances improved, earning appreciation from teammates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arteta-full-backs-have-been-so-consistent |title=Arteta – Full backs have been so consistent |first=Chris |last=Harris |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=20 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922223230/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arteta-full-backs-have-been-so-consistent |archivedate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/9555832/Manchester-City-1-Arsenal-1-match-report.html |title=Manchester City 1 Arsenal 1: match report |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2018 |quote=The visiting supporters were treated to strong performances from Per Mertesacker at centre-half, the German's quick reading of the game making up for any slowness of movement, and the rapidly maturing right back Carl Jenkinson.}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/carl-jenkinson-impressing-england-to-backdrop-of-duel-over-nationality-nkzkfvmb0w8 |title=Carl Jenkinson impressing England to backdrop of duel over nationality |first=Matt |last=Hughes |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2018 |quote=Jenkinson's vastly improved performances while deputising for Bacary Sagna this season have all but ensured he will play international football at some point, but the question is for whom? |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[England national football team|England]] manager.&lt;ref name="England Elect"/&gt;

Jenkinson and teammates [[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]], [[Kieran Gibbs]], [[Aaron Ramsey]] and [[Jack Wilshere]] all signed new long-term contracts with Arsenal in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/five-young-internationals-sign-new-contracts |title=Five young internationals sign new contracts |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204726/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/five-young-internationals-sign-new-contracts |archivedate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made only six more appearances in the rest of the season;&lt;ref name=sb1213/&gt; in one of the six, a 1–0 win away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 9 February which he started only because [[Laurent Koscielny]] was injured in the warm-up, he was sent off after being booked twice for a "lunge" on [[Jack Colback]] and a "clumsy challenge" on [[Stéphane Sessègnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21311614 |title=Sunderland 0–1 Arsenal |first=Neil |last=Johnston |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2013 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
Jenkinson featured in all three of Arsenal's opening matches of the 2013–14 campaign as injuries to defenders [[Thomas Vermaelen]] and Koscielny forced Sagna to fill in at centre-back and Jenkinson to deputise at right back.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Despite Koscielny later returning, Jenkinson kept his place in the first-team after impressing against [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magowan |first=Alistair |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23831033 |title=Arsenal 1–0 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2014 Jenkinson scored his first senior team goal for Arsenal in their 2–0 victory over Norwich City on the last day of the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/109639/norwich-city-vs-arsenal-fc/report |title=Norwich City 0–2 Arsenal Match report |publisher=Goal.com |date=11 May 2014 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Ham United loans====

====2016–17 season====
Before the opening match of the [[2016–17 Arsenal F.C. season|2016–17 season]], [[Arsène Wenger]] stated that Jenkinson was expected to be fit for first-team action in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20160810/team-news-gabriel-jack-per-welbeck |title=Team news: Gabriel, Jack, Per, Welbeck |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=10 August 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for Arsenal since 2014 slightly ahead of schedule, on 25 October, starting at right back in the team's 2–0 League Cup win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref name=ReturnReading/&gt; He received plaudits for his performance{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and had a chance early on to open the scoring.&lt;ref name=ReturnReading&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/Arsenal-vs-Reading/367469 |title=Arsenal 2–0 Reading: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fires Gunners into last eight |first=Jack |last=Wilkinson |publisher=Sky Sports |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson played in four matches in November,&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; but after the last{{snd}}the League Cup quarter-final loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in which he made an error that cost Arsenal a goal and his substitution was cheered by Arsenal fans{{snd}}Wenger suggested that he lacked confidence and needed to regain his competitiveness away from the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38073806 |title=Arsenal 0–2 Southampton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/02/arsene-wenger-carl-jenkinson-arsenal-west-ham |title=Arsène Wenger to spare Carl Jenkinson the spotlight at West Ham |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=2 December 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkinson himself disagreed, and concluded that if he was out of the team, he needed to move to a club where he would play regularly.&lt;ref name=RecordStraight&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/09/carl-jenkinson-sets-record-straight-arsenal-future-crystal-palace/ |title=Carl Jenkinson sets record straight on Arsenal future and why Crystal Palace move broke down |first=Sam |last=Wallace |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the January 2017 transfer window, a fee was agreed for a permanent move to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], managed by [[Sam Allardyce]] with whom Jenkinson had worked at West Ham, but the player could not agree personal terms.&lt;ref name=RecordStraight/&gt; He remained at Arsenal for the rest of the season, but did not play for the first team.&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt;
