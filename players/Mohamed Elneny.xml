===Basel===
[[File:Mohamed Elneny.jpg|thumb|left|Elneny in 2013]]

[[FC Basel]] had been watching Elneny for some time and invited him to their training camp in [[Estepona]] from 14 to 24 January 2013. Elneny played his unofficial debut on 18 January 2013 during the friendly match against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]], a 1–1 draw. Elneny was able to impress Basel's trainer [[Murat Yakin]] during the training camp and on 29 January 2013, it was announced that he had signed a loan contract with Basel up until the end of June 2013.&lt;ref name="fcb 1"&gt;{{cite web |last=FC Basel 1893 |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2013 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/29486/26/7/7 |title=Der Ägypter Mohamed Elneny wechselt leihweise zum FCB |format= |work= |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |language=de | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140107195057/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/29486/26/7/7 | archive-date = 7 January 2014 | dead-url = yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahram1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mosselhi |first=Mohamad |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2013 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/53/63624/Sports/Talents-Abroad/Egypt-midfielder-ElNenny-joins-Swiss-side-Basel-on.aspx |title=Arab Contractors midfielder Mohamed El-Nenny signs a six-month loan deal with Swiss side Basel |format= |work= |publisher=ahram.org.eg |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" kingfut.com 1"&gt;{{cite web |last=King Fut |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2013 |url=http://www.kingfut.com/2013/01/29/official-el-nenny-seals-loan-to-fc-basel/ |title=OFFICIAL: FC Basel sign Mohamed El-Nenny on loan |format= |work= |publisher=kingfut.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elneny played his official debut for Basel in the [[2012–13 Swiss Super League|2012–13 Swiss Super League season]] on 10 February 2013 in the 3–0 home win against [[FC Sion|Sion]] as he was substituted in at half time.

During May 2013 Basel announced that they had taken up the option of signing the Egyptian midfielder on a permanent basis. He signed a four-year contract up-until 30 June 2017.&lt;ref name="fcb 2013-05-03"&gt;{{cite web |last=Elassal |first=Mahmoud |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2013 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/53/70641/Sports/Talents-Abroad/Basel-take-up-option-to-buy-Egypts-ElNeny.aspx |title=Basel take up option to buy Egypt's Elneny |format= |work= |publisher=ahramonline |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Basel, the last goal of the match, in the 4–2 home win at the [[St. Jakob-Park]] against [[FC Zurich|Zurich]] on 16 April 2014.&lt;ref name="fcb-2014-04-16"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marti |first=Caspar |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2014 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/32106/26/7/7 |title=Der FCB festigt seine Leaderposition mit einem 4:2 gegen den FCZ |format= |work= |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |accessdate=16 April 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232551/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/de-de/10044/32106/26/7/7 | archive-date = 26 April 2014 | dead-url = yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[2013–14 Swiss Super League|2013–14 Super League season]] Elneny won the league championship with Basel.&lt;ref name="fcb 2014-05-18"&gt;{{cite web |last=Grossenbacher |first=Sacha |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2014 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/Saison/Saisonspiel?m=2816 |title=Fotos vom Spiel gegen Lausanne sowie den anschliessenden Feierlichkeiten |format= |work= |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |accessdate=18 May 2014 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also reached the final of the [[2013–14 Swiss Cup]], but were beaten 2–0 by [[FC Zürich|Zürich]] after extra time. During the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|2013–14 Champions League season]] Basel reached the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] and finished the group in third position. Thus they qualified for [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League knockout phase|Europa League knockout phase]] and here they advanced as far as the quarter-finals. In their [[2013–14 FC Basel season|season 2013–14]] Basel played a total of 68 matches (36 Swiss League fixtures, 6 Swiss Cup, 6 Champions League and 10 Europa League and 10 test matches).

The season 2014–15 was a very successful one for Elneny and FC Basel. The championship was won for the sixth time in a row [[2014–15 Swiss Super League|that season]]&lt;ref name="fcb 2015-05-29"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marti |first=Caspar |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2015 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2015/05/29/Der-Meisterfreitag-im-bunten-Zeitraffer |title=Der Meisterfreitag im bunten Zeitraffer |format= |work= |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |accessdate=29 May 2015}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[2014–15 Swiss Cup]] they reached the final. But for the third season in a row, they finished as runners-up, losing 0–3 to [[FC Sion]] in the final. Basel entered the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] and reached the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|knockout phase]] as on 9 December 2014 they managed a 1–1 draw at [[Anfield]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29363537 |title=Liverpool 1 Basel 1 |date=10 December 2014 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But then Basel then lost to Porto in the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League#Round of 16|Round of 16]]. Basel played a total of 65 matches (36 Swiss League fixtures, 6 Swiss Cup, 8 Champions League and 15 test matches). Under manager [[Paulo Sousa]] Elneny totaled 51 appearances, 29 in the Super League, 6 in the Cup and 7 in the Champions League, as well 9 in test games.

Despite the fact that Elneny left the club during the winter break, under their new trainer [[Urs Fischer (footballer)|Urs Fischer]] Basel won the [[Swiss Super League]] championship at the end of the [[2015–16 Swiss Super League|2015–16 Super League season]].

[[File:Arsenal Vs Burnley (24108353364).jpg|thumb|Elneny on his Arsenal debut against Burnley in January 2016]]
On 13 January 2016, after a 3–3 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] confirmed the signing of Elneny from FC Basel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mohamed Elneny: Arsenal confirm signing from Basel |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35308910 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |work=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the transfer was officially confirmed by the club for an undisclosed fee reported to be somewhere between £5 million and £7.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mohamed Elneny joins Arsenal |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20160114/mohamed-elneny-joins-arsenal |publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Confirmed: Arsenal finally announce signing of midfielder Mohamed Elneny |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/634600/Confirmed-Arsenal-finally-announce-signing-of-midfielder-Mohamed-Elneny |publisher=[[Daily Express]] |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned the number 35 shirt for Arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mohamed Elneny: Player Profile Arsenal |url=http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players/mohamed-elneny |publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 win against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the fourth round of the [[FA Cup]], on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flanagan |first1=Chris |title=Why Elneny impressed on debut: 5 things from Arsenal 2–1 Burnley |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-elneny-impressed-debut-5-things-arsenal-2-1-burnley#:YDpBT902moZmcA |website=FourFourTwo |accessdate=30 January 2016 |date=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elneny scored his first Arsenal goal in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] Round of 16 second leg defeat against [[FC Barcelona]], and was later awarded Arsenal's Player of the Month award for March. He also starred in April combining well with [[Aaron Ramsey]], winning the Arsenal's Player of the Month award for a second month.

In the 2017/18 season, on 7 December 2017, Elneny scored his first goal at the Emirates Stadium (his second for Arsenal overall) in the [[2017-18 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] Group Stage against [[FC BATE Borisov]] in a match which ended 6–0 to the home side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/first-emirates-stadium-goal-means-a-lot-to-arsenals-mohamed/1njr8qq1vu3pk1od4w8ast5hjg |title=Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny pleased with first goal in the Emirates Stadium - Goal.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February, Elneny again produced a commendable display in the first leg of Arsenal's round of 32 [[UEFA Europa League|Europa league]] tie against [[Östersunds FK]].

On 8 April 2018, Elneny was sent off against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In a tight game defender [[Jack Stephens (footballer)|Jack Stephens]] tussled with [[Jack Wilshere]] and retaliation from Stephens resulted in referee [[Andre Marriner]] giving him a straight red. Wilshere escaped with just a yellow card but in the aftermath, Elneny received a red card after a shove on [[Cédric Soares]].
