'''Danny Ward''' (born {{birth date|df=yes|1980|6|15}}), also known by the [[nickname]] of '''"Wardy"''',&lt;ref name="Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrl.com/andrew-henderson-explains-left-london-successor-danny-ward|title=Andrew Henderson explains why he left London and his successor, Danny Ward|publisher=Total RL|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] in the [[Super League]], and an English former professional [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. At international level, he played for [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]], and at club level for the [[Leeds Rhinos]], the [[Castleford Tigers]], the [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[London Broncos#2006–2011: Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] in the [[Super League]].

Ward was previously [[Andrew Henderson (rugby league)|Andrew Henderson]]'s assistant coach at the [[London Broncos]], and had held this position since 2015. Prior to this, he was head coach of the Under-19s.

==Background==
Ward was born in [[Dewsbury]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

==Leeds Rhinos==
Ward is the son of former Leeds captain and coach [[David Ward (rugby league)|David Ward]]. He was signed for Leeds from Dewsbury Moor, and he made his début as a substitute against [[Sheffield Eagles]] in 1999. He was named the Leeds Alliance Player of the Year in 2000, before becoming a regular first team member the following season.

Ward first played at international level for the Great Britain Academy before being selected for [[John Kear]]'s England Under-21 squad for the tour of South Africa at the end of the 2001 season. England won the First Test 112–6 in the first test and the second 74–14. In 2002 he was selected in the England 'A' squad to play New Zealand at [[Griffin Park]], losing 12–34. He then was part of the squad to tour Fiji and Tonga. One of his highlights in 2002 was a [[Drop goal#Rugby league|drop goal]] in a victory at the Boulevard on his 21st birthday.

Ward emulated his father by playing in the [[Challenge Cup]] Final in 2003. In 2004 he made 14 first team starts and 12 substitute appearances, and scored a [[try]] in the 46–28 win over Wakefield. Ward played for the [[Leeds Rhinos]] at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2004 Super League Grand Final]] victory against the [[Bradford Bulls]]. In 2004 Ward made the transition into the senior Great Britain team making his début as a substitute against New Zealand in the Tri Nations competition.
[[Image:Danny Ward.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ward in action for Harlequins RL]]
As [[Super League IX]] champions, the Rhinos faced [[2004 NRL season]] premiers, the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]]. Ward played as a {{rlp|pr}} in Leeds' 39–32 victory. In his final season with Leeds, Ward scored a try in the [[2005 Challenge Cup]] Final against Hull and in the Grand Final qualifying win at St. Helens that took the Rhinos back to [[Old Trafford]] for the Grand Final. He played for the Rhinos at {{rlp|pr}} in their [[2005 Super League Grand Final]] loss against [[Bradford Bulls]]. He left Leeds before the 2006 Super League season to join Castleford.

==Castleford Tigers==

At the beginning of the 2006's [[Super League XI]], Ward was released after an unsavoury incident. He joined the [[Castleford Tigers]], who had just been promoted from National League One. Ward adapted well to his new surroundings and one of his highlights that year was a try in the 31–30 victory over his former employers at the Jungle. However, his efforts were not enough to save Castleford from relegation.

==Hull Kingston Rovers==

For the 2007 season, he like [[Luke Dyer]], a teammate of his at Castleford, moved east to pastures new at Craven Park with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. So far, Ward has yet to make the impact that he did at both Leeds and Castleford, but his presence presents a danger to any defence in the whole of [[Super League]].

==Harlequins Rugby League==
He was released from Hull KR on 17 September 2007. He signed a two-year deal with [[London Broncos#Harlequins RL .282006.E2.80.932011.29|Harlequins]] starting from the 2008 season.&lt;ref name="Prop Ward secures Harlequins move"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/london/7012934.stm|title=Prop Ward secures Harlequins move|publisher=BBC|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Ward was the head coach of the [[London Broncos]] Under-19s for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. He was currently the assistant coach in 2015 and 2017.

He was promoted to head coach from the beginning of the 2018 season. Ward took charge of his first professional game with a 56-12 victory over the [[Barrow Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://londonbroncosrl.com/news/broncos-beat-barrow-with-storming-win-in-season-opener/ |title=Broncos beat Barrow with storming win in season opener|work=London Broncos|date=7 February 2018|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
