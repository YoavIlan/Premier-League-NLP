Stanislas returned to West Ham on 19 January 2009, after a 3–1 defeat to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] at [[Edgeley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=STANISLAS RETURNS TO WEST HAM |url=http://www.southendunited.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10444~1525055,00.html |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=19 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005194653/http://www.southendunited.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10444~1525055%2C00.html |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of nine appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals.

He also scored a brace in West Ham's 3–1 [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] [[2009–10 Football League Cup|second round]] victory over arch-rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in August 2009. The first goal came three minutes from time before scoring a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] winner in [[extra time]]. However, the game was marred by the [[2009 Upton Park riot]] which included pitch invasions after both of Stanislas' goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8205836.stm|title=West Ham 3–1 Millwall|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal of the season came on 4 October 2009, when he came off the bench to score a last minute equaliser in a 2–2 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; His final goal of the season was on 28 November 2009, scoring the second goal in a 5–3 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; He remained a first-team player until the end of the season featuring heavily in the run-in as West Ham secured their Premier League safety. Stanislas made a total of 28 appearances in all competitions, scoring 4 goals in the [[2009–10 West Ham United F.C. season|2009–10]] season.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt;

In the summer of 2010, [[Gianfranco Zola]] was replaced by [[Avram Grant]] as manager and Stanislas found himself down the pecking order at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. His first appearance of the season was on 24 August 2010, in a 1–0 win over [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the League Cup.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; He had a prolonged spell in the first team during November and December, making 5 appearances.

In January 2011, he was ruled out until the end of the season after undergoing hernia surgery.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; After four months out, he made his comeback for the reserves on 11 May, playing 30 minutes in a 3–2 defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110511/stanislas-returns-for-reserves_2236884_2358060|title=Stanislas returns for reserves|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=2012-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827130855/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110511/stanislas-returns-for-reserves_2236884_2358060|archivedate=27 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of 8 appearances in all competitions, scoring 1 goal in the [[2010–11 West Ham United F.C. season|2010–11]] season as West Ham were relegated to the Championship.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt;

The summer again brought a change of manager with [[Sam Allardyce]] replacing the departed Avram Grant. His first game of the season was in the league game against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] on 13 August 2011, coming on as a late substitute for [[Herita Ilunga]] in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14429582 |title=Doncaster 0–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC sport |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2011, he scored his first goal of the season in what proved to be his final appearance for the Hammers, in their 2–1 League Cup defeat to [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14569566.stm|title=West Ham 1–2 Aldershot|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
