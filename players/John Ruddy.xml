'''John Thomas Gordon Ruddy''' (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|WolverhW}} club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

Ruddy began his career at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], before signing for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a 19-year-old. He spent five years with Everton, but made just one appearance, while playing on loan at nine different clubs. Ruddy was signed by [[Paul Lambert]] to play for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], gaining promotion to the Premier League.

The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager [[Roy Hodgson]] for the squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. However, on 25 May 2012, he was ruled out after breaking his finger during training. He made his debut in a 2–1 win against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in August 2012. He suffered a long term thigh injury in November 2012, but returned to help Norwich to an 11th-place finish at the end of the [[2012–13 Premier League]] season. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.

==Club career==
===Cambridge United===
Born in [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire]],&lt;ref name=Hugman0910/&gt; Ruddy began his career at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and made his professional debut in the final match of the 2003–04 season at [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]'s [[Brisbane Road]] stadium on 8 May 2004, keeping a [[clean sheet]] and saving a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Ruddy earned his place as Cambridge's first choice keeper in the 2004–05 season, making 38 appearances in a season that saw the U's relegated from league two after finishing bottom with 30 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-two/2004-2005 |title=English League Two 2004–2005 Table |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=19 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428130211/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-two/2004-2005 |archivedate=28 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite Ruddy's tremendous efforts, which included keeping 9 clean sheets and conceding just 45 goals.&lt;ref name=sb0405/&gt;

===Everton===
Ruddy had a trial at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in November 2004, before moving to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the summer of 2005 for a fee of around £250,000 that would rise depending on appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/4565337.stm |title=Ruddy completes Goodison switch |date=20 May 2005 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy was called into the England Under-19 squad in 2005 after being scouted by England goalkeeping coach [[Ray Clemence]] and was touted by his manager [[David Moyes]] as a future England goalkeeper.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In September 2005, Ruddy signed for [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-s-walsall-loan-move.html |title=Ruddy's Walsall loan move |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=23 September 2005 |first=Scott |last=McLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; making four appearances in [[EFL League One|League One]] before returning to Everton.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Loan spells with [[Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C.|Rushden &amp; Diamonds]] and [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] followed.&lt;ref name=rush&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-switches-to-stockport.html |title=Ruddy switches to Stockport |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=12 September 2006 |publisher=Everton F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy made his first and only appearance for Everton in February 2006 in unusual circumstances. Nine minutes into the match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Iain Turner]] was sent off for handling outside the area. Since Turner was substituting for injured first- and second-choice keepers [[Nigel Martyn]] and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]], it meant that Ruddy was the only keeper left who could play. Ruddy went on to keep a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4680522.stm|title=Everton 1–0 Blackburn|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2006|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Ruddy went on loan again. A one-month deal was agreed with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]],&lt;ref name=rush/&gt; which was extended to three months after some impressive performances.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He then agreed a one-month loan with [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11671_2405198,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |title=Wrexham hire Ruddy |first=Lewis |last=Rutledge |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1014027,00.html |publisher=Bristol City F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |title=Ruddy solves keeping crisis |date=22 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231955/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10327~1014027%2C00.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over [[Carlisle United F.C|Carlisle United]], and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In January 2009, he went out on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/ruddy-joins-crewe.html |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |title=Ruddy joins Crewe |date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherwell===
On 24 July 2009, Ruddy joined [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on a six-month loan deal, to vie with [[Michael Fraser (footballer)|Michael Fraser]] and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8168189.stm|title=Well sign Everton keeper on loan|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy kept clean sheets during a 0–0 home draw against Rangers on 12 September 2009 and a 0–0 away draw against Celtic on 17 October 2009.&lt;ref name=Soccerway/&gt; He also saved a Barry Robson penalty in a 3–2 loss to Celtic on 12 December 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When the original loan deal expired in January 2010, the Fir Park club decided that they wanted to keep Ruddy for longer and an extension of a month was agreed with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 27 January 2010, it was announced that both Ruddy and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] teammate [[Lukas Jutkiewicz]] were to extend their stay at the Scottish Premier League club until May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/duo-extend-loans-until-may.html|title=Duo Extend Loans Until May|publisher=Everton F.C.|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy finished the Scottish Premier League season with 15 clean sheets from 34 appearances.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Norwich City===
[[File:Ruddy.JPG|thumb|upright|Ruddy celebrating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s promotion into the [[Premier League]] in 2011]]

On 5 July 2010, Ruddy signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for an undisclosed fee, which Ruddy revealed in 2017 to have been £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39843745|title=John Ruddy: Norwich City goalkeeper not surprised by release from Carrow Road|date=8 May 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Paul Lambert]] revealed that on two earlier occasions he had considered signing Ruddy for clubs he'd previously managed: "It is funny but&amp;nbsp;... [I]&amp;nbsp;... went to watch him for Crewe at MK Dons&amp;nbsp;... but he had an absolute stinker. We also saw him when he was at Stockport and&amp;nbsp;... I decided against him at that time, but when [[Fraser Forster|Fraser]] went and it was clear we wouldn't be able to get him back again I knew John had had a really good season at Motherwell. There was that clamour to sign Fraser, but with the finances we just couldn't do that. I wanted somebody with the same stature, a big goalkeeper, and John had that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraser Forster is top class – Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city-fc/fraser_forster_is_top_class_norwich_city_goalkeeper_john_ruddy_1_1408885|newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy made his debut for City against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the opening fixture of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] which Norwich lost 3–2 at [[Carrow Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8880936.stm|title=Norwich 2–3 Watford|date=6 August 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 1–0 away win against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] on 14 August 2010, following this up with another clean sheet against Swansea on 21 August 2010 which included a penalty save that atoned for his error that led to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8918635.stm |title=Norwich 2–0 Swansea |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ruddy's first season for Norwich, he played 45 out of the 46 league matches, helping City to the [[Premier League]], keeping a clean sheet during the 1–0 away win against Portsmouth on 2 May 2011 which sealed promotion for the Canaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fletcher |first=Paul |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13185001 |title=Norwich seal Premier League place |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy started the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]] as the first choice keeper again for Norwich, starting the 1–1 draw at the [[DW Stadium]] against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14429588.stm|title=Wigan 1–1 Norwich|date=13 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up by making numerous good saves during Norwich's first home premier league match in seven years in a 1–1 draw against Stoke, including a penalty stop against Jon Walters and a save denying Matthew Etherington from a direct free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14520268 |title=Norwich 1–1 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next match, he received his only red card of the season in the match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] after a foul on [[Ramires]] that led to a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14600575.stm|title=Chelsea 3–1 Norwich|date=27 August 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ruddy's fortunes were reversed during the return fixture against Chelsea on 21 January 2012 when he kept his first clean sheet of the season during a 0–0 draw at Carrow Road, making several impressive stops from Fernando Torres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Owen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16559646 |title=Norwich 0–0 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy was voted Player's Player of the Season following Norwich's 12th-place finish,&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/News/2012/john-ruddy-norwich-euro-2012-call-up-wedding |title=Ruddy's big summer |publisher=The Football Association |date=16 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202150206/http://www.thefa.com/England/News/2012/john-ruddy-norwich-euro-2012-call-up-wedding |archivedate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a testament to Ruddy's performances for a highly attacking Norwich team, leading to suggestions that he should be called up for Roy Hodgson's England Euro 2012 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/9622844.stm |title=Norwich boss Lambert leads the 'Ruddy for England' calls |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=24 October 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy's claim for a squad place was only strengthened by his excellent performance during the 2–0 home win against Aston Villa on the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darling |first=Kevin |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973120 |title=Norwich 2–0 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012–13 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of [[Declan Rudd]], [[Jed Steer]] and new goalie [[Mark Bunn (English footballer)|Mark Bunn]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1–1 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although [[Bobby Zamora]] scored the rebound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Osborne |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19304497 |title=Norwich 1–1 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1–0 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1–1 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hughton dealt injury blow as first choice goalkeeper Ruddy is ruled out for three months|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2239947/John-Ruddy-ruled-months.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|location=London|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norwich City: John Ruddy muscle 'ripped off bone'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21078118|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4–0 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Graham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22417730 |title= Norwich 4–0 West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3–2 away win against Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shemilt |first=Stephan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499159 |title=Man City 2–3 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the previous long term injury, Ruddy started the 2013–14 season as Norwich's first choice keeper in the 2–2 draw with Everton at Carrow Road on 17 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Owen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644749 |title=Norwich 2–2 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy had a tough start to the season which included mistake riddled performances against Spurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reddy |first=Luke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23999467 |title=Tottenham 2–0 Norwich |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Gary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24350208 |title=Norwich City 1–3 Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Gary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24681355 |title=Manchester City 7–0 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 5–1 away thrashing at Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henson |first=Mike |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25115744 |title=Liverpool 5–1 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy has been in fine form keeping four clean sheets in nine matches, conceding just seven goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/norwich-city/results |title=Norwich City Results |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this spell Ruddy produced some outstanding performances, including the 2–0 away win against West Bromwich Albion on 7 December 2013 where he saved eight shots, including a brilliant tip around the post from a close range Shane Long header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25164355 |title=West Bromwich Albion 0–2 Norwich City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, it was announced that Ruddy would be released when his contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39780816 |title=Norwich City: John Ruddy &amp; Sebastien Bassong among seven released by Canaries |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the players who were being released were given the option of whether or not they chose to be available for selection in the one remaining match of the season. In the end, Ruddy was the only one of the seven who played in the match, being made team captain for the day (he had previously captained the side for one match in the 2013–14 season when [[Sébastien Bassong]] and [[Russell Martin (footballer)|Russell Martin]] were both absent) and saw out his time with the club by keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/john-ruddy-thankful-for-his-opportunity-to-enjoy-a-fantastic-farewell-appearance-for-norwich-city-1-5006782|title=Norwich City: John Ruddy thankful for his opportunity to enjoy a 'fantastic' farewell appearance for Norwich City |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich |date=7 May 2017 |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 10 July 2017, Ruddy signed a two-year contract with Championship club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20170710-wolves-snap-up-experienced-keeper/ |title=Wolves snap up experienced 'keeper |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His signing came days after the club's previous number one [[Carl Ikeme]] was diagnosed with acute leukaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/wolves-goalkeeper-carl-ikeme-diagnosed-10750504|title=Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme diagnosed with acute leukaemia|last=Domin|first=Martin|date=6 July 2017|newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2018, Ruddy saved an injury time penalty from [[Gary Madine]] away at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in a 1–0 win, in a victory that took Wolves nine points clear of Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/06/wolves-survive-two-injury-time-cardiff-penalties-edge-closer/|title=Wolves survive two injury-time Cardiff penalties to edge closer to Championship title|publisher=Telegraph|date=6 April 2018|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddy became the team's main goalkeeper and was part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League as champions. He was named in the division's PFA Team of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43810017 |title=Manchester City players dominate PFA team of the year |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the EFL's Golden Glove Award for the most clean sheets with 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11699/11351528/wolves-john-ruddy-wins-championship-golden-glove-award|title=Wolves' John Ruddy wins Championship Golden Glove award |publisher=Sky Sports |date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 he extended his contract with Wolves, signing a deal due to last until summer 2020, despite having fallen behind new addition [[Rui Patrício]] as the club's first-choice goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==International career==
On 16 May 2012, Ruddy received his first senior international call-up when [[Roy Hodgson]] selected him as a member of the [[England national football team|England]] squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norwich City's John Ruddy named in England's Euro 2012 squad, but Grant Holt misses out|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city-fc/norwich_city_s_john_ruddy_named_in_england_s_euro_2012_squad_but_grant_holt_misses_out_1_1379272 |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |location=Norwich |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a broken finger ruled him out of the tournament, and [[Jack Butland]] was called up to replace him.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Ruddy was called up for the friendly against Italy in [[Bern]], Switzerland, on 10 August 2012, along with Butland and [[Joe Hart]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He came on for Butland at half-time to make his senior England debut, and made some key saves as England won the match 2–1, keeping a clean sheet in his first England appearance after Butland conceded in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Magowan |title=England 2–1 Italy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19238374 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddy was not included in Hodgson's World Cup squad, with Joe Hart, [[Fraser Forster]] and [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] selected instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2014: England name Ross Barkley in squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27362447 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ruddy married his wife Laura on 2 June 2012. Prior to the Euro 2012 tournament, he jokingly cited breaking his finger as the reason he was able to have his wedding on that date.&lt;ref name=fa/&gt; He is nicknamed "The Iceman".&lt;ref name=ice&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18092160 |title=John Ruddy's rise to the England Euro 2012 squad |first=Chris |last=Osborne |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
