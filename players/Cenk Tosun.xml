Tosun then returned as an added-time substitute in the 2–0 win over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] that was not enough to take Turkey to the round of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey overpower Czechs to go third|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000448/match=2017900/index.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|publisher=UEFA|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group I|failed qualification campaign]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], Tosun scored five goals.

==Style of play==
Tosun has said his ability is equal with his left and right foot, as his father Senol forbade him from using his right foot in an attempt to strengthen his left.&lt;ref name=echo&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Neil|title=Everton target Cenk Tosun – the two-footed Turk who idolises Gabriel Omar Batistuta and just loves scoring goals|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-target-cenk-tosun-two-14087702|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Liverpool Echo|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he idolised Argentine forward [[Gabriel Batistuta]].&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; While Tosun likens himself to [[Mario Gómez]] and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], ''[[The Times]]'' writer Gary Jacob instead found him more similar to the English strikers [[Kevin Davies]] and [[Andy Carroll]] for his physicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tosun cuts frustrated figure on Everton debut|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tosun-cuts-frustrated-figure-on-everton-debut-59cl23rq7|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Times|date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
'''Gaziantepspor'''
*[[Spor Toto Cup]]: 2011–12&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=toto/&gt; &lt;!--Do not remove this. While the English Wikipedia's article on the Spor Toto Cup says it was last staged in 1971, this is incorrect. There is an article on the Turkish Wikipedia about the season https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Spor_Toto_Kupas%C4%B1 and the second reference listed here (from beIN Sports) confirms that Tosun played and scored twice in the final--&gt;

'''Beşiktaş'''
*[[Süper Lig]]: [[2015–16 Süper Lig|2015–16]], [[2016–17 Süper Lig|2016–17]]&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;
