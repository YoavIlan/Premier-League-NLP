'''Stefano Chuka Okaka''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsteːfano oˈkaːka}}; born 9 August 1989) is an Italian [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on loan from English club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

==Club career==
===Roma===
Born in [[Castiglione del Lago]], Umbria, Italy to [[Nigeria]]n parents who later obtained Italian citizenship, Okaka joined the [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] youth system in 2004. He was part of the team that won the [[Trofeo Giacinto Facchetti|U-20 national title]] in 2005 and scored goals against Juventus in the semi-final and Atalanta in the final.

On 29 September 2005, he made his debut with the first team in the [[UEFA Cup]], playing against [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]]. He thus became the youngest footballer to debut in an international competition for an Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://it.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=2005/round=2208/match=81841/index.html|publisher=UEFA.com|language=Italian|title=Roma in scioltezza|accessdate=15 January 2008|date=29 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okaka scored his first official goal for Roma in a [[Coppa Italia]] match against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] on 8 December 2005, with a powerful run from midfield and a precise shot to the left of the goalkeeper, making him the youngest goalscorer in the competition.&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"/&gt; He made his [[Serie A]] debut with the club later that month, on 18 December 2005, at the age of 16 years and 125 days, in a 1–1 away draw against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/sport/cards/i-piu-giovani-esordire-serie-a/stefano-okaka.shtml|title=I più giovani a esordire in Serie A Pellegri come Amadei quando la carriera inizia a 15 anni|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|author1=Fiorenzo Radogna|date=21 November 2016|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/speciali/statistiche/2006/giocatori/presenze_okaka_chuka_ste.shtml|title=Stefano OKAKA CHUKA|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several more appearances for the senior squad, scoring his first [[Serie A]] goal nine months later, on 17 September 2006, the last of three Roma goals in a 3–1 win over [[A.C. Siena|Siena]], just 38 days after his 17th birthday, after coming on as a substitute for [[Francesco Totti]]. He also made his debut in the [[UEFA Champions League]] later that month, in a 2–1 away loss to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], on 27 September.&lt;ref name="Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/sampdoria/story/2036404/stefano-okaka-could-be-top-italy-striker-says-sampdoria-coach-sinisa-mihajlovic|title=Stefano Okaka could be top Italy striker, says Sampdoria coach|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Ben Gladwell|date=15 September 2014|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently loaned to [[Serie B]] side [[Modena F.C.|Modena]] for the [[2007–08 Serie B|2007–08 season]] in order to gain some first team experience. Okaka had a fairly good season at Modena, scoring seven times in 33 appearances.

After returning to Roma, he signed a new contract which lasted until 30 June 2012. As a part of it, he earned a gross annual salary of €0.6M in the first two seasons, which then increased to €0.7M and €0.9M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asroma.it/NewsDoc.aspx?Categoria=ITComunicatiFinanziari&amp;Documento=9547|title=Prolungato il contratto economico per le prestazioni sportive di Stefano Okapa|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=18 June 2010|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent a six-month loan period at [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] in Serie B from January to June 2009, where he scored two goals in 16 appearances.

On August 2009, he scored his first goal with Roma in a continental competition, the final goal in a 7–1 result defeat of [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] in the second leg of the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]] third qualifying round. He scored again in the Europa League in Roma's 2–0 win over [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] and in Roma's 2–1 win over Fulham. His last goal with Roma was an 88th-minute winner against Siena.

On 1 February 2010, he joined Fulham on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut for Fulham in the 1–0 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 3 February 2010. He scored his first goal for the club on 14 February 2010 in a 5th round [[FA Cup]] tie at home to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2011 he moved to [[F.C. Bari 1908|Bari]] on loan. There, he scored his first goal against [[US Lecce|Lecce]] for 1–0 win. In this game he and [[Kamil Glik]] marking their debuts for Bari. He scored one further goal for Bari that season. Okaka sustained an injury in round 30 and missed the rest of the season.

In August 2011, Okaka was attacked by Roma fans after a training session for allegedly not wishing to sign autographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landolina|first1=Salvatore|title=Roma Condemn Fan Attacks On Ahmed Barusso &amp; Stefano Okaka|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2176/serie-a/2011/08/10/2614011/roma-condemn-fan-attacks-on-ahmed-barusso-stefano-okaka|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Goal|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to make a single appearance for Roma in the first half of the season, on 22 January 2012, he joined [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coerts|first1=Stefan|title=Official: Parma sign Roma's Stefano Okaka on loan|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2012/01/22/2860468/official-parma-sign-romas-stefano-okaka-on-loan|publisher=Goal|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first Parma goal on 7 March 2012, the opener in a 2–2 against Fiorentina. He netted his second goal on 21 April from the spot against Cesena. He scored his third against Palermo four days later.

===Parma===
Having returned to Roma at the end of the season Okaka signed a permanent deal with Parma on 20 August. The following day he was loaned to the newly promoted [[Serie B]] club [[Spezia Calcio|Spezia]] where he made 38 appearances, scoring seven goals and assisting six more. After his loan spell, he returned to Parma for the 2013–14 season, making only two Serie A matches as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcparma.com/flashnews/shirt-numbers-2013-14?lang=en|title=Shirt numbers 2013–14|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Parma F.C.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174727/http://fcparma.com/flashnews/shirt-numbers-2013-14?lang=en|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampdoria===
On 31 January 2014, Okaka was transferred to the fellow Serie A outfit [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] on a permanent deal, with [[Nicola Pozzi]] moving the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/okaka-e-un-calciatore-blucerchiato-pozzi-va-al-parma.html|title=Okaka è un calciatore blucerchiato, Pozzi va al Parma|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=9 February 2014|work=U.C.

He scored his first goal of the [[2014–15 Serie A|2014–15]] season on 14 September 2014, a solo effort, in the 2–0 victory against [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] on 14 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimaldi|first1=Filippo|title=Sampdoria-Torino 2–0: Gabbiadini e Okaka, show a Marassi|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/14-09-2014/sampdoria-torino-2-0-gabbiadini-okaka-show-marassi-90446992070.shtml#|accessdate=28 June 2016|work=La Gazetta dello Sport|date=14 September 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2015, the owner and president of Sampdoria Massimo Ferrero told the Italian media that Okaka would be leaving the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampdoria, Ferrero: "No a Pazzini.

===Anderlecht===
On 28 July 2015, Okaka joined Belgian side [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] from Sampdoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official: Anderlecht sign Okaka|url=http://www.football-italia.net/70216/official-anderlecht-sign-okaka|website=Football Italia|accessdate=10 April 2016|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
On 29 August 2016, Okaka joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] from Anderlecht on a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official: Okaka signs|url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/okaka-signs|website=Watford FC|accessdate=30 April 2016|date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He scored his first two goals for Watford on 10 December 2016, against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in a Premier League match which Watford went on to win 3–2. Okaka first equalised for the ''Hornets'' to make it one apiece, producing an elegant [[Glossary of association football terms|back-heeled]] strike from inside the six-yard box and then put his side 3–1 up after heading in from a corner. He was awarded the 'man of the match' in that game.

===Udinese===
On 8 January 2019, Okaka was signed by [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on a season long loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.football-italia.net/132984/official-okaka-joins-udinese&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
After gaining Italian citizenship in 2007, Okaka was selected for the [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italian Under-19]] side. He made his debut for the Italy U-20 team in 2008, scoring two goals.&lt;ref name="figc_presenze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=3155&amp;squadra=3|publisher=FIGC.it|language=Italian|title= OKAPA CHUKA STEFANO – Convocazioni e presenze in campo|accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 2009, he made his debut with the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy U-21]] squad in a match against [[Luxembourg national under-21 football team|Luxembourg]].

In April 2014, Okaka revealed he was in talks with the [[Nigeria Football Federation]] about the possibility of him switching allegiance to his parents' country and play with the [[Nigeria national football team]] already at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/24-04-2014/okaka-gioca-la-nigeria-ci-penso-ma-sono-italiano-80512356275.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian |accessdate=25 April 2014 |date=24 April 2014 |title=Okaka gioca per la Nigeria? "Ci penso, ma sono italiano" |trans-title=Okaka playing for Nigeria? "I am thinking, but I am Italian" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Okaka was included in the Italy squad for their friendly against [[Albania national football team|Albania]] on 18 November 2014 by manager [[Antonio Conte]]. He made his debut as a substitute, replacing [[Sebastian Giovinco]] in the second half, and scored the winning goal at Sampdoria's ground the [[Stadio Luigi Ferraris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International friendly: Italy edge to narrow 1–0 victory over Albania in Genoa|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/327826/report|accessdate=19 November 2014|work=[[Sky Sports]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
