'''Maarten Stekelenburg''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmaːrtə(n) ˈsteːkələ(n)ˌbɵrx}}; born 22 September 1982) is a Dutch [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Stekelenburg began his career at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], playing 282 matches over nine seasons and winning nine honours, including two [[Eredivisie]] titles. He went on to play for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and Everton.

Stekelenburg made his debut for the Netherlands in 2004, and has earned 58 caps in total as of July 2018. He was understudy to [[Edwin van der Sar]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]], then was first choice as he helped his nation to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] and played at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Stekelenburg began his career at Zandvoort '75 before joining VV Schoten, which he left for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] when he was 15 years old. He made his official debut for Ajax on 24 February 2002, in a match against [[NAC Breda]]. At the start of the 2002–03 season, he won his first prize when Ajax won the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]]. In 2004, he and Ajax won the [[Eredivisie]] championship, having played ten matches that season.

Stekelenburg became the first choice goalkeeper at Ajax in the 2005–06 season. In 2006, he won his first [[KNVB Cup]]. At the start of the 2006–07 season, he won his second Johan Cruyff Shield, which he helped his team defend the next season, and later on in 2006–07, he won his second KNVB Cup.

[[File:Ebecilio Stekelenburg Van der Wiel.jpg|thumb|Stekelenburg with his Ajax teammates]]

Stekelenburg was named Ajax "Player of the Year" for the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]], succeeding [[Wesley Sneijder]].
During the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]], he lost his place in the goal to [[Kenneth Vermeer]] due to injuries. He re-established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper under new manager [[Martin Jol]] and subsequently had a very strong season for both Ajax and the Dutch national side. During the 2009–10 season, Stekelenburg went on to have a consistent season, playing in all of Ajax's Eredivisie and Europa League matches, the latter after they were eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the group stage. However, Stekelenburg sustained a finger injury which kept him out for the remainder of the season. He made a total of 51 appearances in the 2010–11 season in all competitions.

After winning the [[2010–11 Eredivisie]] on 15 May 2011, Stekelenburg dropped the trophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqrrzWN8WKQ|title=Ajax kampioen: Maarten Stekelenburg laat de schaal vallen!!|publisher=YouTube|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; while standing on top of the Ajax team coach with [[Jan Vertonghen]]. He won Ajax Player of the Year for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11854_7055164,00.html |title= Roma told to up Stekelenburg bid |publisher= Sky Sports |date= 22 July 2011 |accessdate= 21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roma===
On 1 August 2011, it was announced Stekelenburg had officially transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for €6.325&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee plus bonuses, making him the first Dutch footballer to ever play for the Italian club.&lt;ref name="Stekelenburg naar AS Roma"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitief: Stekelenburg naar AS Roma &amp;#124; Ajax1.nl &amp;#124; De site met het laatste Ajax nieuws, foto's, Video's, Columns, Twitter, Hyve|url=http://ajax1.nl/archief/definitief-stekelenburg-naar-roma/|publisher=Ajax1.nl|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://res.cloudinary.com/as-roma-turbine-sandbox/image/upload/v1447693974/asroma-uat/hvnwyxqo1gdbhnj1mw2w.pdf|title=Acquisizione A Titolo Definitivo Dei Diritti Alle Prestazioni Sportive Del Calciatore Maarten Stekelenburg|date=1 August 2011|access-date=2 July 2017|publisher=A.S.

===Fulham===
On 3 June 2013, Roma [[director of football|sporting director]] [[Franco Baldini]] confirmed he had finalised a deal with [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for the sale of Stekelenburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11681/8755642/Transfer-news-Roma-confirm-Fulham-deal-for-Maarten-Stekelenburg |title=Transfer news: Roma confirm Fulham deal for Maarten Stekelenburg | publisher=Sky Sports|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on 5 June, Fulham announced Stekelenburg had signed on a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/june/05/stekelenburg|title=Stekelenburg Signs|publisher=Fulham FC|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma later disclosed the fee was €5.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://res.cloudinary.com/as-roma-turbine-sandbox/image/upload/v1445281943/asroma-uat/lugmjrzb0usuepz0d0ew.pdf|title=Relazione Finanziaria Annuale Al 30 Giugno 2014|date=6 October 2014|access-date=28 July 2017|publisher=A.S. Roma|language=Italian|page=122|quote=Valore di Cessione}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 17 August in a 1–0 win away to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]; however, he came off injured in the second half and was replaced by [[David Stockdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23644878|title=Sunderland 0–1 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on 21 October at a win against Crystal Palace, but went on to lose the next four starts in a row.

Following the sacking of [[René Meulensteen]] as Fulham manager, Stekelenburg was dropped to the bench in favour of Stockdale by [[Felix Magath]], and following Fulham's relegation and Stockdale's departure, lost his place in the squad altogether, as Magath favoured [[Jesse Joronen]] and [[Marcus Bettinelli]].

===Monaco===
On 9 August 2014, Stekelenburg joined French club [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=@simonremoussin |url=http://www.asm-fc.com/en/article/maarten-stekelenburg-joins-as-monaco-on-loan-65465.html |title=Maarten Stekelenburg joins AS Monaco on loan &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; AS Monaco FC |website=Asm-fc.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030161059/http://www.asm-fc.com/en/article/maarten-stekelenburg-joins-as-monaco-on-loan-65465.html |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Danijel Subašić]] as Monaco's starting goalkeeper, Stekelenburg was preferred for cup matches, making his debut in the round of 16 of the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] away to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on 17 December. After a 1–1 draw at the [[Stade de Gerland]], he helped Monaco win 5–4 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] by saving from [[Jordan Ferri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitzus|first1=Alessandro|title=OL – ASM (1–1, 5 t.a.b. 4) : Au bout du suspense, Monaco a sorti Lyon|trans-title= OL – ASM (1–1, 5–4 on penalties): After suspense, Monaco put Lyon out on penalties|url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/coupe-de-la-ligue/2014-2015/ol-asm-1-1-5-t.a.b.-4-au-bout-du-suspense-monaco-a-sorti-lyon_sto4516963/story.shtml|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Eurosport|date=17 December 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-finals on 4 February 2015 against [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] at the [[Stade Louis II]], it again went to penalties after a goalless draw.

On 1 July 2016, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], managed by compatriot [[Ronald Koeman]], announced they had signed Stekelenburg from Fulham for an undisclosed transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36690263|title=Maarten Stekelenburg: Everton sign goalkeeper from Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 July 2016|date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 13 August as ''the Toffees'' began their campaign with a 1–1 home draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hart|first1=Simon|title=Everton vs Tottenham: Erik Lamela cancels out Ross Barkley opener as Maarten Stekelenburg denies Spurs|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-vs-tottenham-erik-lamela-cancels-out-ross-barkley-opener-as-maartin-stekelenburg-denies-a7189206.html|accessdate=16 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October, he saved penalties from [[Kevin De Bruyne]] and [[Sergio Agüero]] to ensure the same result away to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Ian|title=Maarten Stekelenburg saves two penalties as Nolito rescues City a point|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-vs-everton-match-report-maarten-stekelenburg-nolito-romelu-lukaku-a7363461.html|accessdate=16 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stekelenburg was limped off the field after suffering from a leg injury in the 63rd minute of the [[Merseyside derby]] at Goodison Park against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 19 December 2016.

==International career==
===Netherlands national football team===
Stekelenburg was a member of the Dutch squad at the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. He made his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 3 September 2004 against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]], whom they beat 3–0.

====2006 World Cup and Euro 2008====
Stekelenburg was called up by manager [[Marco van Basten]] for the squad of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, but he did not play any match during this tournament as [[Edwin van der Sar]] was first choice.

Despite his international debut in 2004, Stekelenburg was called-up to Van Basten's [[UEFA Euro 2008]] squad to play as understudy to Van der Sar. He participated in the Group C match against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 17 June—with the Netherlands already having qualified for the quarter-finals, the coach fielded a second-string side to give players like Stekelenburg an appearance. He kept a clean sheet in the 2–0 win at the [[Stade de Suisse]] in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=France 0–2 Italy &amp; Netherlands 2–0 Romania|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7363393.stm|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2008 friendly match against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], Stekelenburg was sent-off after 44 minutes of the first half for fouling [[Joshua Kennedy]], becoming the first goalkeeper of the Dutch national side to receive a red card.

====2010 World Cup and after====
[[File:Michael Krohn-Dehli - Maarten Stekelenburg 20120609.jpg|thumb|Stekelenburg beaten by [[Michael Krohn-Dehli]] at Euro 2012]]

After Van der Sar's retirement from the national team, Stekelenburg became the Netherlands' first-choice goalkeeper under manager [[Bert van Marwijk]]. Stekelenburg was included in the preliminary squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iO9bETRJh0iovmmUN7ZeFDugTEIg |title=Van Marwijk trims Dutch squad to 27 | publisher=AFP|date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2010, Van Marwijk announced he would be part of the final 23-man squad participating in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/27/holland-world-cup-23-man-squad |title=Holland coach Bert van Marwijk finalises World Cup squad |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 May 2010 |agency=Press Association |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stekelenburg helped the Netherlands reach [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|the final of the competition]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by making key saves throughout the tournament, from [[Kaká]] in the Netherlands' 2–1 victory against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; He conceded six goals in the whole tournament, two of them being [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s. Despite making a number of saves in the final, he ended up on the losing side, conceding the match's only goal to [[Andrés Iniesta]] in the 116th minute.

Stekelenburg played all three matches during the group stages of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] as the Netherlands finished bottom of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group B|their group]].

On 7 October 2016, four years after his last international appearance, Stekelenburg started in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group A|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]], a 4–1 Dutch victory.
