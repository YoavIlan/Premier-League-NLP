Snodgrass started his senior career with [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]]. He also had a loan spell at [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] before moving to England in 2008, joining [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. He helped Leeds win promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in 2010. In February 2012, Snodgrass was appointed [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of Leeds, but he rejected a new contract offer and moved to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in July. He left Norwich after they were relegated in 2014 and moved to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. On his league debut for Hull, Snodgrass suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for over a year.

==Early life==
Born in [[Glasgow]], Snodgrass grew up in the city's [[Gallowgate, Glasgow|Gallowgate]] area;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31495582 |title=Scotland's Robert Snodgrass on the 'hardest task' of his life |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |first=Richard |last=Wilson |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played boys club football for a team affiliated with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] alongside future international teammate [[James McArthur]] who is a month younger and lived a few blocks away.&lt;ref name=roots&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/robert-snodgrass-grassroots-football-glasgow-7592004 |title=Robert Snodgrass: Grassroots football in Glasgow was tough... but it is brilliant |work=Daily Record|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] offered him an apprenticeship, along with [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] and [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]]. He felt that he had little chance of breaking through at [[Celtic Park|Parkhead]], so chose Livingston, joining their setup at the same time as another East End boy who would go on to play for Scotland, [[Graham Dorrans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingston-mad.co.uk/feat/edz6/robert_snodgrass_interview_210608/index.shtml |title=Robert Snodgrass Interview|publisher=Digital Sports Group|work=Livi Mad |date=10 March 2005|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Livingston===
Snodgrass started his career at Livingston, where he scored 15 goals in 79 league games. He caught attention by turning down a trial with Spanish giants [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=BarcelonaTag&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Baillie|date=25 June 2007|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/under20worldcup/Snodgrass-aims-to-put-Barcelona.3298548.jp|title=Snodgrass aims to put Barcelona tag behind him|work=Scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Publishing|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he turned professional, he was offered a move to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], though he chose to stay with Livingston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Livie|date=|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11676_2311276,00.html|title=Livi starlet snubbed Rovers|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering from a broken metatarsal, he moved to [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] on [[loan (association football)|loan]] for the remainder of the [[2006–07 in Scottish football|2006–07 season]] on 30 January 2007 to step up his recovery from injury.&lt;ref name=BarcelonaTag/&gt;

Snodgrass established himself as a regular first-team member during the [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06 season]]. This was a campaign of mixed fortunes, as he gained regular first-team football, yet his side were relegated to [[Scottish First Division|Division 1]]. During Livingston's first season in the second tier, he scored ten goals for Livingston in the Scottish First Division during the 2007–08 season; he was offered a new contract at Livingston, but turned it down. After failing to impress during a trial spell with [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leedsunited/LEEDS-UNITED-Robert39s-at-home.4698809.jp |title=LEEDS UNITED: Robert's at home in Leeds|work=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=15 November 2008|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined [[Football League One|League One]] team [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/7524992.stm|title=Snodgrass completes Leeds switch|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=29 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Lions scoring 15 goals in 79 games.

===Leeds United===
====2008–09 season====
After joining Leeds, Snodgrass came into the side for the first game of the season to make his debut against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], gaining an assist after setting up [[Enoch Showunmi]]'s headed goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scunthorpe 1&amp;nbsp;– 2 Leeds: United Victorious|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/matchreport/20080809/scunthorpe-1-leeds-2_2247678_43673| publisher=Leeds United|date=9 August 2008|accessdate=28 January 2017 |archivedate=27 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227095126/http://www.leedsunited.com/matchreport/20080809/scunthorpe-1-leeds-2_2247678_43673}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Leeds in the 5–2 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} After initially struggling to hold a regular place in the starting line-up, Snodgrass established himself after a string of impressive performances throughout November and December, which saw the young winger score four goals in seven games during a poor run of form for the Yorkshire club, culminating in the sacking of manager [[Gary McAllister]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Leeds reached the playoffs but ultimately were knocked out of the competition after losing 2–1 on aggregate to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-one/5325188/Leeds-United-1-Millwall-1-Agg-1-2-Match-report.html|work=The Telegraph|title=Leeds United 1 Millwall 1: Match report|date=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the top assist maker in the division with 16, despite only playing regular first team football from December onwards.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In his first season at Leeds, he scored 11 goals and got 19 assists.&lt;ref name="leedsunited.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20101102/snoddy-on-form-elland-road-and-last-term_2247585_2205213 |title=Snoddy on Form, Elland Road, And Last Term |publisher=Leeds United FC |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate= 29 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105111109/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20101102/snoddy-on-form-elland-road-and-last-term_2247585_2205213 |archivedate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, he was selected in the [[Football League One|League One]] [[PFA Team of the Year]] for the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/league-one/pfa-divisional-team-of-the-year-league-one |title=PFA Divisional Team of the Year: League One |publisher=Sports New Media |work=Give Me Football |date=26 April 2010 |accessdate=12 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913082546/http://www.givemefootball.com/league-one/pfa-divisional-team-of-the-year-league-one |archivedate=13 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snodgrass played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to [[Football League Championship|The Championship]] after finishing in second place in League One and thus earning automatic promotion.

==International career==
[[File:Snodgrass vs Brazil (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Snodgrass playing for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 2011]]

Snodgrass is a former [[Scotland national under-19 football team|Scotland under-19]], [[Scotland national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] international. With the under-19 team, he was part of the squad that reached the final of the [[2006 European Under-19 Football Championship|2006 European Championships]] in Poland, although Snodgrass was suspended for the final itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/5221720.stm |title=Scotland U19 1–2 Spain U19 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=29 July 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snodgrass also played for [[Scotland national under-20 football team|Scotland under-20]] in the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6270034.stm |title=Scotland U20 0–2 Nigeria U20 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |date=5 July 2007|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his form in this tournament that led to Barcelona showing interest in Snodgrass.&lt;ref name="McColl"/&gt;

Leeds' involvement in the play-offs against Millwall in 2009 meant that Snodgrass was unavailable to play in a [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland B]] international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leeds star Robert Snodgrass determined to force way back into Scotland reckoning|work=Daily Record|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=10 February 2011|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2010/10/28/leeds-star-robert-snodgrass-determined-to-force-way-back-into-scotland-reckoning-86908-22663926/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snodgrass was called up to the senior [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] squad by [[George Burley]] for the first time for their [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in October 2009.&lt;ref name = "2009 callup"/&gt; He was forced to withdraw from the squad due to a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leedsunited/Leeds-United-Does-Scotland-call.6618351.jp|title=Leeds United: Does Scotland call up beckon for Snodgrass?|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=9 November 2010|quote=A knee injury came between Snodgrass and his international debut 13 months ago and the landscape north of the border has shifted since then.

On 2 August 2011, Snodgrass was called up to the squad for a friendly against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref name="leedsunited3"/&gt; He made his first start for Scotland against Denmark and also scored his first international goal in this game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/9561341.stm | work=BBC Sport | first=Martin | last=Conaghan | title=Scotland v Denmark as it happened | date=10 August 2011| accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/14481694.stm | work=BBC Sport | title=Snodgrass pleased with debut goal | date=10 August 2011 | accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2013, during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying]], he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], inflicting their first competitive defeat at home since they lost 4–1 to [[England national football team|England]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22787925 |title=Croatia 0–1 Scotland|work= BBC Sport|date= 7 June 2013|accessdate= 8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kneecap injury that Snodgrass suffered in August 2014 caused him to miss the whole of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] campaign. He was recalled to the national squad for a friendly match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35866870 |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Scotland v Czech Republic: I'm back at my previous level – Snodgrass |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first match of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Snodgrass scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win against [[Malta national football team|Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37207612 |title=Malta 1–5 Scotland |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |first=Alasdair |last=Lamont |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Snodgrass has a daughter, Sienna, with his girlfriend Denise.&lt;ref name="McColl"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article1779973.ece |work=Times Online| title=Stirling provide the spark as Snodgrass gets back on track | first=Graham | last=McColl | date=12 May 2007|accessdate=28 May 2010}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for Snodgrass after he failed to turn up to court regarding an alleged driving offence.&lt;ref name = "arrest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/BREAKING-Arrest-warrant-out-for.6700820.jp|title=Arrest warrant out for Leeds United winger|last=Robinson|first=Paul|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Leeds United said that the non-appearance was due to a misunderstanding and that Snodgrass was working with the judicial authorities to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name = "arrest"/&gt;

On 3 March 2017, another arrest warrant was issued for him after he failed to attend his trial for allegedly driving in Glasgow with a baby being held in the arms of a passenger. His defence lawyer said that Snodgrass' absence was due to a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warrant issued for Scotland footballer Snodgrass over baby in car|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-39156677|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
