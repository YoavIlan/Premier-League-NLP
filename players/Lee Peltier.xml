===Liverpool===
Peltier joined the [[Liverpool F.C.

===Yeovil Town===
In order to gain further first team opportunities, manager [[Rafael Benítez]] loaned Peltier to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 31 July 2007 until 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter|last=O'Rourke|title=Yeovil land Reds starlet|url=http://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11669/2632412/yeovil-land-reds-starlet|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/1929987.time-is-ticking-for-yeovil-town/ |title=Time is ticking for Yeovil Town |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=28 December 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier agreed to join the club following encouragement from his mother.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Eleven days later, he made his debut in a 1–0 defeat against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt; Although a right-back, Peltier played as a [[midfielder]] during an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in November, but switched back to his original position against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] after one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lee Peltier, Yeovil Town Steve Claridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/20/yeovil|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Claridge|first=Steve|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 21 appearances in all competitions during his loan spell without scoring.&lt;ref name="sb0708"/&gt;

On 21 January 2008, he joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on trial, featuring in a reserve team fixture against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], but was not offered a contract by manager [[Glenn Roeder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/peltier.htm |title=Lee Peltier |publisher=Flown From The Nest |last=Whitlam |first=Steve |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2008, he returned to Yeovil on a permanent basis for a small fee, signing a  three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/2010550.liverpool-youngster-returns-to-yeovil-town/ |title=Liverpool youngster returns to Yeovil Town |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season having made 38 appearances in all competitions, including his original loan spell, and won the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt;&lt;ref name="yeovilaward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/2237031.peltier-is-yeovil-towns-young-gun/ |title=Peltier is Yeovil Town's young gun! |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season with Yeovil, Peltier made 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring his only goal for the club in a 3–2 victory over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on 20 December 2008.&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt; His performances attracted attention from several clubs and Yeovil assistant manager [[Nathan Jones (Welsh footballer)|Nathan Jones]] confirmed that the club would not "stand in his way [...] if the price was right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/4448847.peltier-could-leave-yeovil-town-if-the-price-is-right/ |title=Peltier could leave Yeovil Town if the "price is right" |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his positive performancea, Peltier later admitted to suffering from homesickness during his spell with Yeovil having moved away from Liverpool for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/huddersfield-towns-peltier-life-yeovil-5006541.amp |title=Huddersfield Town's Peltier on life at Yeovil Town |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting "I was quite happy with my football but [...] I struggled a bit and got quite homesick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/huddersfield-town-lee-peltier-interview-1-2237295 |title=Huddersfield Town: Lee Peltier interview |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huddersfield Town===

====2009–10 season====
On 30 June 2009, he joined fellow League One side Huddersfield Town on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yeovilexpress.co.uk/sport/4466934.peltier-leaves-yeovil-town/ |title=Peltier leaves Yeovil Town |newspaper=Yeovil Express |last=Sowden |first=Steve |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier had previously impressed manager [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]] during his brief trial spell with Norwich, where Clark was serving as assistant manager.&lt;ref name=lfchistory.net/&gt; He made his debut in a 2–2 draw against Southend United at [[Roots Hall]] on 8 August 2009.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt; He was switched from right-back to left-back for Huddersfield's game against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] due to the usual left-back [[Dean Heffernan]] being out with a dead leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htafc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10312~49009,00.html|title=Huddersfield vs Millwall|publisher=Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=19 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419043538/http://www.htafc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10312~49009,00.html|archivedate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Town's first choice left-back keeping the position for the remainder of the regular season. Peltier helped Town to reach the play-offs in League One playing at left-back for the first leg at home to Millwall, but was forced to return to his usual position of right-back for the second leg at the [[New Den]] due to an injury to [[Tom Clarke (footballer, born 1987)|Tom Clarke]] in the first leg of the play-off semi final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htafc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10312~51464,00.html|title=Huddersfield vs Millwall|publisher=Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520044317/http://www.htafc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10312~51464,00.html|archivedate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours of Huddersfield's League One playoff defeat, the club received enquiries for several players including Peltier. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/alex-smithies-lee-peltier-could-4973104 |title=Alex Smithies and Lee Peltier could be set to leave Huddersfield Town |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 June 2011, he signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Leicester City F.C|Leicester City]], becoming [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s first signing of the summer after agreeing a three-year deal at the [[King Power Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Foxes pounce for Peltier"&gt;{{cite web| title= Foxes pounce for Peltier| url= http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2379842,00.html| publisher= Leicester City F.C| date=22 June 2011| accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been recommended to Eriksson by his assistant [[Derek Fazackerley]] who had previously worked with Peltier at Huddersfield where Fazackerley had worked as Lee Clark's assistant.&lt;ref name="patience"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-patience-set-to-pay-off-for-warnock-1-4803189 |title=Patience set to pay off for Warnock |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial fee was reported to be around £750,000 as part of a package worth over £1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/huddersfield-town/ward_is_tipped_for_return_to_top_after_1m_move_1_3571564 |title=Ward is tipped for return to top after £1m move |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/huddersfield-town-fc/huddersfield-town-news/2011/06/22/huddersfield-town-sell-lee-peltier-to-leicester-city-86081-28918862/ |title=Huddersfield Town sell Lee Peltier to Leicester City: Former Town coach Derek Fazackerley on the deal |first=Dougie |last=Thomson |newspaper=[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]] |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August 2011, Peltier scored the winning goal during his league debut, in a 1–0 victory over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], in the opening game of Leicester's 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14352025 |title=Coventry City 0–1 Leicester City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club struggled for form at the start of the season which lead to Eriksson's dismissal at the end of October having spent over £10 million on new signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/huddersfield-town-old-boy-lee-4958890 |title=Huddersfield Town old boy Lee Peltier eyes FA Cup tonic with Leicester City |publisher=Examiner Live |last=Thomson |first=Doug |date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the season Peltier made 40 league appearances, scoring twice,&lt;ref name="sb1112"/&gt; and was the club's first choice right-back, ahead of [[John Pantsil]].&lt;ref name="patience"/&gt; The club finished the season in ninth place under Eriksson's successor [[Nigel Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19161868 |title=Championship 2012-13 season: Club-by-club guide |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Madden |first=Phil |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, after the club signed Belgian right-back [[Ritchie De Laet]], Leicester announced that Peltier was not part of Pearson's long-term planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-tug-of-war-for-leicester-city-star-1-4749186/amp |title=Leeds United: Tug of war for Leicester City star |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Leicester player [[Steve Walsh (footballer)|Steve Walsh]] commented his belief that "his better performances came under Sven and I don’t think Nigel saw the best of him", leading to him being made available for a transfer.&lt;ref name="patience"/&gt; Despite this, Walsh claimed that Peltier would be a "good signing for any club in this league."&lt;ref name="patience"/&gt; Having been made available, Peltier chose to return home from a pre-season training camp in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Lee-Peltier-tells-Leicester-City-want/story-16553582-detail/story.html |title=Lee Peltier tells Leicester City: 'I want out' |newspaper=Leicester Mercury |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720200240/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk:80/Lee-Peltier-tells-Leicester-City-want/story-16553582-detail/story.html| archivedate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this triggered transfer interest from his former club Huddersfield Town and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

===Leeds United===
Peltier joined Leeds United on 4 August 2012, and signed a three-year contract with the club. He became the club's tenth signing of the summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120804/defender-completes-united-move_2247585_2871481|title=Peltier becomes latest signing|publisher=Leeds United F.C.|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with manager Neil Warnock making his signing a priority after missing out on his original target [[Joel Ward (footballer)|Joel Ward]].&lt;ref name="patience"/&gt; Peltier made his competitive debut for Leeds playing at centre-back in the first game of the season against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the League Cup on 11 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After much speculation regarding Peltier's position lf captain, despite captaining Leeds during 2013–14 pre-season and for the opening two games of the season, Peltier was replaced in the role by teammate [[Rodolph Austin]] who returned to the side against Leicester City on 11 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/w3yls943av5x1s4p0c6p3eyxk/title/leicester-live!|title=Leicester Vs Leeds|publisher=Leeds United F.C.|date=11 August 2013|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier publicly supported Austin following the announcement, commenting "It was the gaffer’s choice to go with Rudy and I respect that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-axed-captain-peltier-says-he-s-buzzing-for-pal-austin-1-6049850 |title=Axed captain Peltiers says he’s ‘buzzing’ for pal Austin |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier scored his first Leeds goal in a 1–1 draw against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 26 December 2013 with a looping header.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After falling out of favour under McDermott, on 24 March 2014, Leeds announced that Peltier had signed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan, however Forest owner [[Fawaz Al-Hasawi]] announced the same day that the deal hadn't been completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

However, Warnock's appointment collapsed when he was unable to agree personal terms with the club's hierarchy. Peltier attempted to back out of the move after being informed that Warnock was not going to be appointed and had hoped to join Bolton Wanderers instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/neil-warnock-i-could-have-got-nottingham-forest-promoted-into-the-premier-league-9222568.html |title=Neil Warnock: I could have got Nottingham Forest promoted into the Premier League |newspaper=The Independent |last=Warnock |first=Neil |date=29 March 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; who submitted a late bid to sign him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/11101742.amp/ |title=Bolton Wanderers move in for Leeds United defender Lee Peltier after Nottingham Forest let-down |newspaper=The Bolton News |last=Iles |first=Marc |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transfer had already been processed and Peltier eventually completed his move to Forest without Warnock.&lt;ref name="Forestloan"/&gt; He was favoured in a central midfield position for Forest under caretaker manager [[Gary Brazil]], making his debut in a 1–1 draw with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on 29 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26695402 |title=Ipswich Town 1–1 Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 March 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Forest appointing [[Stuart Pearce]] as the new manager, Peltier revealed upon his return to Leeds that he wasn't sure what his future would hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Return to Huddersfield Town===
On 23 June 2014, Peltier left Leeds United, after reaching a mutual agreement with the club to cancel the last year of his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11295089.peltier-quits-leeds-united/ |title=Peltier quits Leeds United |newspaper=Telegraph &amp; Argus |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite interest from Forest, Bolton Wanderers and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]],&lt;ref name="relieved"/&gt; on the same day, Peltier rejoined former club Huddersfield Town on a three-year deal. He took the number 37 shirt which he wore during his loan spell at Nottingham Forest at the end of the previous season.

The appointment of [[Paul Trollope]] in 2016 as Slade's successor threatened to displace Peltier from the side with the new manager favouring more attack minded full-back [[Jazz Richards]].

==International career==
Peltier is a former youth international player having represented his native England at international level. He was capped at under-18 level three times during his time as a player at hometown club Liverpool but has not been capped at a higher level than under-18s to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Huddersfield-pound-1m-price-tag-Leicester-City/story-12789820-detail/story.html|title=Huddersfield put £1m price-tag on Leicester City target Lee Peltier|date=17 June 2011|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=Leicester Mercury |archiveurl=https://archive.is/2nYuc |archivedate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Peltier was approached by the [[Antigua and Barbuda Football Association]] to represent the [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|Benna Boys]] at international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baptitste|first=Neto|title=Help for Benna Boys|url=http://www.antiguaobserver.com/?p=79817|publisher=Antigua Observer|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Though mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]], Peltier also plays in the centre-back position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doug|last=Thomson|title=Huddersfield Town ready to step up bid to bring Lee Peltier back after defender leaves Leeds United|url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/huddersfield-town-ready-step-up-7310804.amp|newspaper=Huddersfield Daily Examiner|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that right-back is his favourite position and has described himself as "a hard working defensive type of player who likes to tackle and pass the ball. I get about the pitch quite well and keep it simple."&lt;ref name="pink"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Doug|last=Thomson|title=Nothing new about midfield role for Huddersfield Town’s Lee Peltier|url=https://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/news/nothing-new-midfield-role-huddersfield-4981184.amp|newspaper=Huddersfield Daily Examiner|accessdate=24 March 2018|date=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not move up the flanks and shoot crosses; instead he only plays as a defender. Scott Johnson from ''[[Media Wales#Wales Online|WalesOnline]]'' wrote that he "does not fit the modern stereotype of what we now expect from a full-back, as he is not particularly swashbuckling or flashy."&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 2009, Peltier was shopping with fellow footballer [[Victor Anichebe]] in [[Knutsford]] when the pair were stopped by police officers after being accused of theft. During the incident, Peltier was handcuffed by officers and Anichebe's crutch was confiscated.
