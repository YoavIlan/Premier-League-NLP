[[File:Chelsea 1 Everton 0 (15890813963).jpg|thumb|Stones defending against Chelsea's [[Loïc Rémy]] in February 2015]]

On 7 August 2014, Stones signed a new five-year contract to keep him with Everton until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-international-john-stones-puts-4020369 |title=England international John Stones puts pen to paper on new five-year deal at Everton |newspaper=Daily Mirror |first=Alex |last=Richards |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered an ankle injury against Manchester United on 5 October, ruling him out for between 10 and 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29552025 |title=Everton: John Stones could miss rest of 2014 with ankle injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the injury, Stones was listed among the nominees for the [[Golden Boy (award)|Golden Boy 2014 Award]] alongside fellow Everton winger [[Gerard Deulofeu]] and fellow [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Calum Chambers]], [[Luke Shaw]] and eventual winner [[Raheem Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/20/liverpool-raheem-sterling-wins-golden-boy-award |title=Liverpool's Raheem Sterling wins Europe's Golden Boy award for 2014 |date=20 December 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stones was sent off in Everton's 4–1 away win at [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] in the last 32 of the [[UEFA Europa League]] on 19 February 2015, for conceding a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] with a foul on [[Guillaume Hoarau]], who went on to miss the spot-kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31523676 |title=BSC Young Boys 1–4 Everton |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Mike |last=Whalley |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Everton in a 3–0 home win against Manchester United on 26 April 2015, heading in the team's second goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32371018 |title=Everton 3–0 Manchester United |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Richard |last=Winton |date=26 April 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and August 2015, Stones was reportedly the subject of three bids from Chelsea – of £20&amp;nbsp;million, £26&amp;nbsp;million and £30&amp;nbsp;million – all of which were rejected by Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33584857 |title=Chelsea's John Stones bid angers Everton boss Roberto Martinez |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 July 2015 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2540960/chelsea-john-stones-bid-of-26m-rejected-by-everton--sources |title=Chelsea John Stones bid of £26&amp;nbsp;million rejected by Everton, say sources |publisher=ESPN FC |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33977836 |title=John Stones: Everton defender not for sale despite '£30m Chelsea bid' |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stones was reported to have handed in a [[Transfer market#Transfer request|request to leave]] Everton, but this was also refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34055843 |title=John Stones: Chelsea target makes Everton transfer request |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Simon |last=Stone |date=25 August 2015 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, Stones fouled Stoke City's [[Marko Arnautović]] in added time at the end of a home match, conceding a penalty from which the same player scored the winning goal in a 4–3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35148469 |title=Everton 3–4 Stoke |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Luke |last=Reddy |date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2016, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] completed the signing of Stones for £47.5&amp;nbsp;million on a six-year deal with a potential extra £2.5&amp;nbsp;million in add-ons, making him the world's second most expensive defender in history, behind [[David Luiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/10528801/john-stones-joins-manchester-city-in-475m-deal |title=John Stones joins Manchester City in £47.5m deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-city-complete-signing-of-john-stones-from-everton |title=Manchester City complete £47.5m signing of John Stones from Everton |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37020275 |title=John Stones: Manchester City sign Everton defender for £47.5m |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccertransfers.net/manchester-city-sign-john-stones-for-47-5m-on-a-six-year-deal-50456/ |title=Manchester City sign John Stones for £47.5m on a six-year deal |publisher=SoccerTransfers.net |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927200403/http://www.newsigning.co.uk/manchester-city-sign-john-stones-for-47-5m-on-a-six-year-deal-50456/ |archivedate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement followed shortly after the leaking of his arrival, having been included in City's [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Play-off round|Champions League play-off round]] squad registration list which [[UEFA]] had published on their website prior to confirmation of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/09/john-stones-named-in-manchester-citys-champions-league-squad-on/ |title=John Stones completes move to Manchester City from Everton, after Uefa website unexpectedly breaks news |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Matt |last=Law |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a 15% sell-on clause, Barnsley received £6.78&amp;nbsp;million from Stones' transfer to Manchester City, an amount larger than any transfer fee they had received in their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bilton |first1=Toby |title=Barnsley net £7m from John Stones' move to Manchester City |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/barnsley-fc/barnsley-net-7m-from-john-stones-move-to-manchester-city-1-8058522 |accessdate=13 September 2017 |work=Yorkshire Post |date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named as a standby player for England's [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] squad, but was not included in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup squads#England|final squad]].

==Style of play==
Known for his technical ability and physical presence, Stones is celebrated for being a ball-playing central defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcfcwatch.com/2017/10/26/city-stat-john-stones-is-european-footballs-pass-master-in-201718 |title=City Stat: John Stones is European football’s pass master in 2017/18 – City Watch |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teammates and coaches have praised his composure with the ball,&lt;ref name="goal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/stones-has-as-much-composure-as-any-defender-in-europe-says/3ggjk0euxk8o1cjjszcmd11vm |title=England: Southgate gushes over Stones, compares him to Pique and Boateng - Goal.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defensive skills,&lt;ref name="mcfcwatch.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcfcwatch.com/2017/10/26/city-stat-john-stones-is-european-footballs-pass-master-in-201718/ |title=City Stat: John Stones is European football’s pass master in 2017/18 – City Watch |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; range of passing,&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/09/john-stones-pep-guardiola-flaws-manchester-city-everton |title=John Stones: a rare talent but value only if Pep Guardiola removes the flaws – Andy Hunter |first=Andy |last=Hunter |date=9 August 2016 |website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, vision&lt;ref name="mcfcwatch.com"/&gt; and versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2016/august/john-stones-in-quotes |title=John Stones: In Quotes |website=MCFC}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Joleon Lescott]] said of his ability: "John can do things most defenders can’t – a little feign here and there, maybe a turn to get out of trouble when he needs to – and that’s what is going to set him apart from others – the ability to do things others can’t. He’ll do his job and defend well, but there will be moments when he does something special and you’ll just go ‘ah, that’s why he’s regarded as the best.’ He doesn’t seem to get fazed by anything and always seems calm and he never hides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2017/november/joleon-lescott-impressed-with-john-stones |title=Lescott: Stones has the X-Factor |website=MCFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester City and England teammate [[Kyle Walker]] added "You don't quite appreciate him until you are playing alongside him. He rarely gets beat, he is great on the ball and he is very calm and level-headed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11130440/man-citys-kyle-walker-hails-unbelievable-john-stones-and-special-pep-guardiola |title=Man City's Kyle Walker hails 'unbelievable' John Stones and 'special' Pep Guardiola |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed his ball-playing style early in his career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11125793/how-paul-heckingbottom-moulded-careers-of-john-stones-alfie-mawson-and-mason-holgate |title=How Paul Heckingbottom moulded careers of John Stones, Alfie Mawson and Mason Holgate |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many crediting Manchester City coach [[Pep Guardiola]] for his later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-pep-guardiolas-love-is-helping-john-stones-fulfil-potential-t39pnmhlw |title=How Pep Guardiola's love is helping John Stones fulfil potential |first=Paul |last=Hirst |date=4 October 2017 |work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His range of passing has led to comparisons with [[Rio Ferdinand]],&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; [[Gerard Piqué]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-city/story/2998808/pep-guardiola-compares-john-stones-to-gerard-pique-of-barcelona |title=Stones compares to a young Pique – Pep |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jérôme Boateng]],&lt;ref name="goal.com"/&gt; [[Pep Guardiola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/11/16/john-stones-no-longer-soft-touch-instead-rock-heart-manchester/ |title=John Stones is no longer a soft touch, but instead a rock at heart of Manchester City's defence – thanks largely to Pep Guardiola's patience |first=James |last=Ducker |date=16 November 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Beckenbauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport360.com/article/football/english-premier-league/253060/john-stones-on-striving-for-man-city-dominance-comparison-with-franz-beckenbauer-and-coming-up-against-neymar-at-wembley |title=John Stones striving for sustained Manchester City domination in England and Europe |publisher=Sport 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
