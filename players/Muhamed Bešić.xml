'''Muhamed Bešić''' ({{IPA-sh|muxǎmed běʃitɕ|bs}}; born 10 September 1992) is a Bosnian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C|Middlesbrough]], on loan from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]].

Bešić started his professional career at [[Hamburger SV]], playing mainly in its [[Hamburger SV II|reserve team]], before moving to [[Ferencvárosi TC (football)|Ferencváros]] in 2012. Two years later he joined Everton. He was loaned to Middlesbrough in 2018.

A former youth international for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bešić made his senior international debut in 2010, and is the youngest player ever to represent the country. He made over 30 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] since and represented the nation at their first major tournament, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Berlin]] to Bosnian parents, Bešić joined local club [[Tennis Borussia Berlin|TB Berlin]] at the age of 14, where he remained until he was 16, when he signed for [[Hamburger SV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/middlesbrough-je-raskrsnica-za-karijeru-muhameda-besica/267125|title=Middlesbrough je raskrsnica za karijeru Muhameda Bešića|website=sportsport.ba|date=4 February 2018|accessdate=5 February 2018|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2010, Bešić signed his first professional contract with Hamburger SV until June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/besic-do-ljeta-2013-godine-u-hamburgu/46128|title=Bešić do ljeta 2013. godine u Hamburgu|website=sportsport.ba|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=3 July 2011|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut in [[Bundesliga]] game against [[Borussia Dortmund]] on 12 November 2010 at the age of 18. Bešić came on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the 80th minute when Dortmund was already leading 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/besic-debitovao-za-hamburg/46548|title=Bešić debitovao za Hamburg|website=sportsport.ba|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, he started his first Bundesliga game away at [[Hannover 96]], and played full 90 minutes in a 3–2 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/ibisevic-postigao-dva-gola-u-dvije-minute-mujdza-zabio-autogol/101120062|title=Ibišević postigao dva gola u dvije minute, Mujdža zabio autogol|website=klix.ba|date=20 November 2010|accessdate=23 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Bešić was suspended from the first team, due to lack of discipline. Bosnian media also claimed that manager [[Thorsten Fink]] "strangled" Bešić and threw him out of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/fink-daveci-izbacio-besica-iz-svlacionice/77473|title=Fink daveći izbacio Bešića iz svlačionice|website=sportsport.ba|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferencváros===
In 2012 Bešić was signed by Hungarian club [[Ferencvárosi TC (football)|Ferencváros]] on [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scsport.ba/vijesti/jos-jedan-bh-internacionalac-u-madjarskoj-kiso-potpisao-za-debrecen/42936|title=Još jedan bh internacionalac u Mađarskoj, Kiso potpisao za Debrecen|website=scsport.ba|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=12 September 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first and only goal for the club in an away victory over [[Paksi FC|Paksi]], which was also his first professional goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://24.hu/sport/foci/2013/05/05/nem-adja-magat-konnyen-a-fradi/|title=Nem adja magát könnyen a Fradi|website=24.hu|date=5 May 2013|accessdate=21 July 2018|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season, he helped the team win [[Ligakupa]] by beating [[MOL Vidi FC|MOL Vidi]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/predstavljamo-zmajeve-muhamed-besic-je-zvijezda-u-usponu/140531097|title=Predstavljamo Zmajeve: Muhamed Bešić je zvijezda u usponu|website=klix.ba|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=6 March 2016|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Bešić prolonged his contract with Ferencváros until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/muhamed-besic-u-ferencvarosu-do-2016-godine/109020|title=Muhamed Bešić u Ferencvarošu do 2016. godine|website=sportsport.ba|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=3 November 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
On 28 July 2014 Bešić signed a five-year contract with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for an undisclosed fee, speculated to be in the region of £4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/everton-complete-4m-signing-muhamed-7522246|title=Everton complete £4m signing of Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been an unused substitute in the first two games of the season, he made his first [[Premier League]] appearance on 30 August against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], replacing [[Romelu Lukaku]] in the 89th minute; however he made a defensive error which allowed opponent [[Diego Costa]] to score the final goal in a 3–6 home defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2738380/Everton-3-6-Chelsea-Quickfire-Diego-Costa-sparks-goal-rush-Blues-maintain-perfect-start.html|title=Everton 3-6 Chelsea: Quickfire Diego Costa sparks goal rush as Blues maintain perfect start|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić made his first start for Everton in the [[Merseyside derby]] on 27 September, being substituted after 80 minutes for [[Samuel Eto'o]] as the game ended in a 1–1 away draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-1-1-everton-phil-jagielka-4332406|title=Liverpool 1-1 Everton: Phil Jagielka wonder strike secures late point for the Toffees|website=mirror.co.uk|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second season at Everton was plagued by [[hamstring]] injuries, which limited his appearances and playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.in/football/everton/story/2542958/muhamed-besic-to-miss-start-of-everton-season-for-hamstring|title=Everton's Muhamed to miss start of season with injured hamstring|website=espn.in|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsmole.co.uk/football/everton/injury-news/news/besic-injury-absence-frustrating_258292.html|title=Muhamed Besic: Injury absence is frustrating|website=sportsmole.co.uk|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-blow-mo-besic-suffers-10781429|title=Everton blow as Mo Besic suffers recurrence of hamstring injury|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=24 January 2016|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016 he was voted Everton's Player of the Month for January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mo-besic-everton-player-month-10906801|title=Mo Besic is Everton Player of the Month for January|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=17 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also extended his contract until June 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skysports.com/football/news/11671/10186863/muhamed-besic-has-signed-a-deal-which-will-keep-him-at-everton-until-2021|title=Muhamed Besic signs new Everton deal until the summer of 2021|website=skysports.com|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Bešić was ruled out for about six month as he [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore anterior cruciate ligament]] in his right knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bbc.com/sport/football/36983793|title=Muhamed Besic: Everton midfielder out for six months with knee injury|website=bbc.com|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić was slowly making his way back to full fitness as he was involved with Everton Under-23s' in mid-April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://royalbluemersey.sbnation.com/2017/4/15/15310250/everton-burnley-injury-report-match-preview-besic-two-weeks-schneiderlin|title=Besic still a couple of weeks away for Everton|website=royalbluemersey.com|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed the whole [[2016–17 Everton F.C. season|2016–17]] campaign, not playing a single minute for Everton, before eventually returning to action coming on as a 77th-minute substitute for his national team on 9 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-midfielder-muhamed-besic-gets-13168238|title=Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic gets much-needed action in Bosnia draw|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=10 June 2017|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić returned to Premier League action on 21 August 2017, almost 16 months since his last game, in a 1–1 away draw at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/21/manchester-city-vs-everton-premier-league-live/|title=Wayne Rooney scores but Raheem Sterling levels it as both sides finish with ten|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After falling out of favor at Everton, in January 2018, Bešić joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42898285|title=Middlesbrough sign Everton's Muhamed Besic and Huddersfield's Martin Cranie|website=bbc.co.uk|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted on 17 February against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-citys-energy-levels-scale-14304067|title=Cardiff City's energy levels are off the scale once again as Middlesbrough become the latest victims of a Neil Warnock masterclass|website=walesonline.co.uk|date=18 February 2018|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bešić scored his first goal for Middlesbrough, which was also his first goal in over four years, against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 21 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5641875/Derby-1-2-Middlesbrough-Muhamed-Besic-Britt-Assombalonga-dent-Rams-play-hopes-away-win.html|title=Derby 1-2 Middlesbrough: Muhamed Besic and Britt Assombalonga dent Rams play-off hopes in away win|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić returned to Middlesbrough on a season-long loan in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6090633/Middlesbrough-confirm-signing-Everton-midfielder-Mo-Besic-one-year-loan.html|title=Middlesbrough confirm the signing of Everton midfielder Mo Besic on one-year loan|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=23 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20150331 2213 AUT BIH 2666.jpg|thumb|Bešić playing for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 2015]]

Bešić claimed in an interview that he had declined an offer to play for [[Germany national football team|Germany]], because he only wished to play for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://faktor.ba/vijest/besic-imao-samo-poziv-njemacke-srce-je-odabralo-bih/7305|title=Bešić: Imao sam poziv Njemačke, srce je odabralo BiH|website=klix.ba|date=14 October 2018|accessdate=16 October 2018|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21]] side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/muhamed-besic-spahicev-nasljednik-i-vodja-u-21-reprezentacije/130609013|title=Muhamed Bešić, Spahićev nasljednik i vođa U21 reprezentacije|website=klix.ba|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=12 June 2013|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2010, Bešić was called-up to the senior team by [[Safet Sušić]] for [[Exhibition game|friendly]] game against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://radiosarajevo.ba/sport/nogomet/debi-besica-povratak-salihovica-i-zeca/36734|title=Debi Bešića, povratak Salihovića i Zeca|website=radiosarajevo.ba|date=5 November 2010|accessdate=7 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in that match, thereby becoming the youngest player to ever play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at senior level. The record was previously held by [[Miralem Pjanić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/zmajevi-preokrenuli-protiv-slovaka-za-vaznu-pobjedu/101117098|title=Zmajevi preokrenuli protiv Slovaka za važnu pobjedu|website=klix.ba|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bešić was selected to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], country's first ever major competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/bosnia-and-herzegovina/10810419/Bosnia-Herzegovina-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 2014 World Cup squad|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his tournament debut in the opening group game, which ended in a narrow loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255931/match=300186477/match-report.html|title=Bosnia beaten by Messi marvel|website=fifa.com|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given a straight red card on 6 September 2015, in a 3–0 home win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifying game for throwing his chewing gum at [[Víctor Rodríguez (Andorran footballer)|Víctor Rodríguez]], who was also sent off for retaliating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/bih-u-nervoznoj-utakmici-lako-slavila-protiv-andore/170984|title=BiH u nervoznoj utakmici lako slavila protiv Andore|website=sportsport.ba|date=6 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2015|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
During his career, Bešić has been deployed as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] and as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre back]], although his natural position by his own words is [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://klix.ba/sport/nogomet/muhamed-besic-za-klix-ba-sada-igram-na-poziciji-desnog-beka-i-dobro-mi-ide/140405078|title=Muhamed Bešić: Sada igram na poziciji desnog beka i dobro mi ide|website=klix.ba|date=5 April 2014|accessdate=6 April 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was described in 2014 by Everton manager [[Roberto Martínez]] as a "very complete footballer", who "has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he's a technical player on the ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/martinez-besic-ima-predispozicije-za-nevjerovatnu-karijeru/137921|title=Martínez: Bešić ima predispozicije za nevjerovatnu karijeru|website=sportsport.ba|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
