Born in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], [[Pennsylvania]], Pulisic began his professional career at Borussia Dortmund, where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, in which he featured in only 15 youth games, he was promoted to the senior team in 2016, at age 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Uersfeld |first=Stephan |date=January 5, 2016 |title=U.S. youngster Christian Pulisic trains with Borussia Dortmund first team |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/borussia-dortmund/story/2780485/us-christian-pulisic-trains-with-dortmund-first-team?src=com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured sparingly in his first season at the club, but his involvement increased dramatically in the following campaign, where he was a mainstay in the Dortmund team that won the [[2016–17 DFB-Pokal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USA's Pulisic a fast-rising talent at Dortmund|url = https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/01/21/christian-pulisic-usa-borussia-dortmund|website = www.si.com|access-date = January 26, 2016|first = Liviu|last = Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two seasons of first-team football at Borussia Dortmund, Pulisic moved to Chelsea in January 2019 in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth [[Euro|€]]64&amp;nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|$]]73&amp;nbsp;million/[[Pound sterling|£]]58&amp;nbsp;million), making him the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive American player of all time]].

Pulisic holds several [[Bundesliga]] and Dortmund records; he is the youngest non-German to score in the league, the youngest player to score two Bundesliga goals, and is the youngest player to appear and score for Dortmund in the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Pulisic scores again to become youngest player ever with two Bundesliga goals|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/christian-pulisic-scores-again-to-become-youngest-player-ever-with-two-bundesliga-goals-042316|accessdate=April 23, 2016|publisher=Fox Sports|date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. international, Pulisic has scored 9 goals in 23 games for his country. He has appeared and scored at every [[United States Soccer Federation|youth level]], and made his senior debut in March 2016, at age 17. Later that year, Pulisic featured at the [[Copa América Centenario]], before he became the youngest person to appear and score in a [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup Qualifier]] for the United States. Pulisic has also featured as team captain; their youngest ever.

==Early life==
Pulisic was born in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], where he spent the majority of his childhood. His parents, [[Mark Pulisic|Mark]] and Kelley Pulisic, both played collegiate soccer at [[George Mason University]] and his father also played professional [[indoor soccer]] for the [[Harrisburg Heat (NPSL/MISL)|Harrisburg Heat]] in the 1990s and later became a coach at both youth and professional levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiY0Sk1G0g|title=Das American: Christian Pulisic's Spectacular Rise|first=|last=VICE Sports|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pulisic lived in England for a year at the age of seven, playing for the youth team of [[Brackley Town F.C.|Brackley Town]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; When his father was general manager of indoor club [[Detroit Ignition]] in the mid-2000s, Pulisic lived in Michigan and played for Michigan Rush. After the family returned to the Hershey area, Pulisic grew up playing for local [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] club PA Classics and occasionally training with local professional club Harrisburg City Islanders, now known as [[Penn FC]], during his teen years.

Pulisic's grandfather, Mate Pulišić, was born in Croatia on the island of [[Olib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/10920/1/Christian-Pulisic-rising-USA-soccer-star-in-Germany-has-Croatian-roots.html|title=Christian Pulisic rising USA soccer star in Germany has Croatian roots|website=www.croatia.org|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulisic applied for Croatian citizenship after moving to Germany (and the [[European Union]]) in order to avoid having to apply for a German work visa. He got an offer to play for the [[Croatia national football team|Croatia national team]], but declined to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pulisic nikada neće postati Pulišić|url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/sport/domaci-nogomet/clanak/id/307420/pulisic-nikada-nece-postati-pulisic|accessdate=November 11, 2016|publisher=Slobodna Dalmacija|language=Croatian|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulisic has a cousin, [[Will Pulisic]], who has also represented the United States at the under-17 level, as a goalkeeper, who also plays for Borussia Dortmund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. under-17 keeper Will Pulisic set to join cousin Christian at Dortmund|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/borussia-dortmund/story/2835198/us-u17-keeper-will-pulisic-set-to-join-cousin-at-dortmund|accessdate=April 18, 2016|publisher=ESPN FC|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Borussia Dortmund===

In February 2015, [[Borussia Dortmund]] signed 16-year-old Pulisic and assigned him first to their U17 squad and in Summer 2015 to the U19. After scoring 10 and assisting 8 in just 15 games with the Dortmund youth teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/01/31/who-us-international-christian-pulisic-and-how-did-he-make-borussia-dortmund-first|title=Who is US international Christian Pulisic, and how did he make the Borussia Dortmund first team at 17 years old?|work=MLSsoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulisic was called to join the first team over winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der nächste Schritt für Passlack und Pulisic|url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/642270/artikel_der-naechste-schritt-fuer-passlack-und-pulisic.html|website = kicker online|access-date = January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16: Breakthrough season====
In January 2016, while with the first team in the winter break, Pulisic played the second half of two friendly matches, scoring one goal and assisting another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christian Pulisic scores in Dortmund win|url = http://sbisoccer.com/2016/01/christian-pulisic-scores-in-dortmund-win|website = Soccer By Ives|access-date = January 26, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, a day after making his debut on the first team bench, Pulisic played 90 minutes in a friendly against [[1. FC Union Berlin|Union Berlin]], scoring a goal and assisting another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christian Pulisic scores second friendly goal of month for Dortmund|url = http://sbisoccer.com/2016/01/christian-pulisic-scores-second-goal-of-month-for-dortmund|website = Soccer By Ives|access-date = January 26, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Bundesliga debut in a 2–0 win against [[FC Ingolstadt 04|FC Ingolstadt]] on January 30, 2016, coming on as a second-half substitute for [[Adrián Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American 17-year-old Christian Pulisic makes Bundesliga debut for Dortmund|url=http://www.espnfc.us/borussia-dortmund/story/2797405/american-christian-pulisic-makes-bundesliga-debut-at-age-17|accessdate=January 30, 2016|publisher=ESPN FC|date=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, Pulisic made his [[UEFA Europa League]] debut as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 victory against [[FC Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000659/match=2017168/index.html|title=Dortmund deal Porto heavy blow|work=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulisic made his first Bundesliga start on February 21, against Bayer Leverkusen before eventually being substituted for [[Marco Reus]]. He made his second Bundesliga start on April 10, against [[FC Schalke 04]] in the ''[[Revierderby]]'', playing 73 minutes before being replaced by [[İlkay Gündoğan]]. In response to Pulisic's performance against Schalke, team manager [[Thomas Tuchel]] said, "He's a teenager in his first year of professional football. His first two games in the starting eleven were in Leverkusen and here today in Schalke – not the easiest of tasks. It shows our huge appreciation that we see him as a full time player on our team. He was a valuable substitute against Werder Bremen and Liverpool. He has looked really good recently which has been proved today. It is completely normal that he could not have played with this pace and this intensity for over 90 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screamer.deadspin.com/christian-pulisic-is-more-than-just-the-next-hyped-savi-1770345385|title=Christian Pulisic, The Latest "Savior Of American Soccer," Is More Than Just Hype|last=Redford|first=Patrick|website=Screamer|language=en-US|access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulisic scored his first Bundesliga goal for Borussia Dortmund on April 17, opening the scoring in a 3–0 home win against [[Hamburger SV]]. It made him the youngest non-German and fourth-youngest player to score a goal in the Bundesliga, at just 17 years and 212 days old.&lt;ref name="youngest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/borussia-dortmund/story/2852892/christian-pulisic-youngest-non-german-to-score-in-bundesliga|title=Christian Pulisic becomes youngest non-German to score in Bundesliga|work=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his goal against [[VfB Stuttgart]] on April 23, Pulisic broke another Bundesliga scoring record by becoming the youngest player to score two goals in the top-flight league. The game also marked his first yellow card in the Bundesliga, as a result of a challenge on [[Emiliano Insúa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/christian-pulisic-scores-again-to-become-youngest-player-ever-with-two-bundesliga-goals-042316|title=Christian Pulisic scores again to become youngest player ever with 2 Bundesliga goals|work=FoxSports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September Champions League group stage game against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], with Dortmund trailing 2–1, Pulisic came on as a second-half substitute and helped set up [[André Schürrle]]'s late goal, allowing Dortmund to earn a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/borussia-dortmund/story/2960753/borussia-dortmund-christian-pulisic-describes-assist-on-andre-schurrle-goal-an-amazing-moment|title=Christian Pulisic describes Andre Schurrle leveller as 'amazing moment'|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a substitute appearance on October 22, Pulisic assisted one goal and scored the equalizer against [[FC Ingolstadt 04|FC Ingolstadt]], who were last place at the beginning of the day, to salvage a draw, coming back from 3–1 down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/borussia-dortmund/story/2978874/christian-pulisic-dortmund-showed-good-heart-to-fight-back-for-draw |title=Christian Pulisic: Dortmund showed 'good heart' to fight back for draw |work=ESPN FC |date=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Pulisic has represented the United States at the U-15 and U-17 levels. He captained the U.S. U-17 national team at the [[2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup|2015 U17 World Cup in Chile]], where he had a goal and an assist in three games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/matches/round=271783/match=300298362/match-report.html|title=FIFA U-17 World Cup Chile 2015 – Matches – USA 2:2 (2:0) Croatia – FIFA.com|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulisic scored 20 goals in 34 games with the U17's during his two-year cycle with the team.

On March 27, 2016, Pulisic was called up to the Senior team by coach [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] ahead of a [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualifying game]] against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2016/03/27/15/57/160327-mnt-klinsmann-adds-zusi-and-pulisic-to-world-cup-qualifying-roster|title=Zusi, Pulisic Added to MNT Roster Ahead of Qualifying Match vs. Guatemala, Presented by Liberty Mutual Insurance, in Columbus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he made his debut in that match, a 4–0 win at the [[Mapfre Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], as an 81st-minute substitute for [[Graham Zusi]]. He became the youngest American to play a World Cup qualifier.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite news|title=PULISIC MAKES HISTORY AS USA BEAT GUATEMALA|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Tournaments/noblmd28-pulisic-youngest-ever-usmnt-player-to-play-world-cup-qualifier-aged-17.jsp|accessdate=April 18, 2016|publisher=Bundesliga|date=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before appearing in that match, Pulisic had been eligible to play internationally for [[Croatian national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Straus|first1=Brian|title=Pulisic cap-tied to U.S. after playing in WCQ|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/03/29/christian-pulisic-usa-cap-tied-croatia-world-cup-qualifier|accessdate=October 6, 2017|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 29, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2016, Pulisic recorded two goals and an assist in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match in a 6–0 victory over [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/02/us-player-ratings-christian-pulisic-steals-show-qualifying-rout|title=US Player Ratings: Christian Pulisic steals the show in qualifying rout|work=MLSSoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the youngest person to score in a World Cup Qualifier for the U.S. and the youngest player ever to score a brace in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2016/09/02/22/51/160902-mnt-players-enter-record-book-as-team-steps-closer-to-hex-in-6-0-wcq-win-at-st-vincent|title=USA Players Enter Record Book as Team Steps Closer to Hex in 6–0 Qualifying Win at St. Vincent|website=www.ussoccer.com|access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], he became the youngest American to start a World Cup Qualifier match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/united-states/story/2945175/christian-pulisic-sets-record-as-youngest-american-to-start-world-cup-qualifier|title=Christian Pulisic becomes youngest U.S. player to start World Cup qualifier|work=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 2017, Pulisic scored both goals in a 2–0 World Cup qualification victory over Trinidad and Tobago. In the last two matches of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF Fifth Round|2018 World Cup Qualification]], Pulisic scored a goal in each match in a 4–0 victory over [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and a 1–2 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago to finish the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF Fifth Round|fifth round]] as the top scorer with five goals.

On November 20, 2018, Pulisic became the youngest player to captain the United States national team in a friendly defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Pulisic was 20 years and 63 days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/why-christian-pulisic-is-the-right-man-to-captain-the-usa-usmnt-dortmund-517955.jsp | title = 10 reasons why Christian Pulisic is the right man to captain the USA | publisher = bundesliga.com | accessdate = December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Pulisic is a modern-day number 10. His low center of gravity allows him to dribble at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faceoffootball.com/scout-report-on-christian-pulisic/|title=Scout Report on Christian Pulisic|first=|last=Shashi|date=March 28, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, he has played more of a winger role for Dortmund. His adept weak-foot skills allow him to play on either side of the field.

Because of his style of play Pulisic is known to be a subject of fouls by opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.'s Christian Pulisic 'not going to change' style in face of multiple fouls|url=http://www.espnfc.com/united-states/story/3221168/uss-christian-pulisic-not-going-to-change-style-in-face-of-multiple-fouls|first=Jeff|last=Carlisle|date=October 5, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans cry foul after Christian Pulisic takes a beating in World Cup qualifier against Panama|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/dynamo/article/Americans-cry-foul-after-Christian-Pulisic-takes-12261181.php|first=Ronald|last=Blum|date=October 7, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|work=Association Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Christian Pulisic Is So Good It Hurts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/sports/soccer/christian-pulisic-usmnt.html|first=Andrew|last=Das|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
