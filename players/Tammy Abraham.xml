'''Kevin Oghenetega Tamaraebi Bakumo-Abraham''' (born 2 October 1997), known as '''Tammy Abraham''', is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] of the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], on [[loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

An academy graduate of Chelsea, Abraham made his senior debut for the club in 2016 before enjoying [[Loan (sports)|loan]] spells with Championship club [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and fellow [[Premier League]] team [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. During his time with the former, he won the club's Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards and was their top goalscorer, becoming the first player ever to do so in a single season.

Formerly an [[England national youth football team|England youth international]], Abraham represented the nation from [[England national under-18 football team|under-18 level]], and featured at the [[2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] in Poland. He made his senior debut in November 2017.

Abraham joined Chelsea at under-8 level and progressed through the club's academy system.&lt;ref name=TAM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/teams/development-squad/under-21s/u21-player-profiles/tammy-abraham.html |title=Tammy Abraham |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=11 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511120030/https://www.chelseafc.com/teams/development-squad/under-21s/u21-player-profiles/tammy-abraham.html |archivedate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the Chelsea youth team which recorded consecutive triumphs in both the [[UEFA Youth League]] and the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref name=TAM /&gt; In the [[2015–16 UEFA Youth League|2015–16 edition]] of the UEFA Youth League, Abraham pitched in with a return of eight goals in nine matches, making him the tournament's second highest goal scorer behind [[Roberto Núñez Mañas|Roberto Núñez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/news/newsid=2354579.html |title=Atlético Madrid's Nuñez takes top scorer honours |publisher=UEFA |date=18 April 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried his form into the FA Youth Cup and netted the winning goal in Chelsea's victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the final in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Belshaw |first=George (27 April 2016) |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/27/chelseas-tammy-abraham-scores-brilliant-header-as-blues-bag-third-consecutive-fa-youth-cup-title-v-manchester-city-5846162/ |title=Chelsea's Tammy Abraham scores brilliant header as Blues bag third consecutive FA Youth Cup title v Manchester City |newspaper=Metro |location=London |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, Abraham scored 74 goals in 98 matches across all competitions for Chelsea's various youth teams.&lt;ref name=Goal&gt;{{cite news |last=Kinsella |first=Nizaar (15 May 2016) |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2016/05/15/23570252/chelsea-finally-gives-youth-a-chance-but-will-conte-follow |title=Chelsea finally gives youth a chance, but will Conte follow suit? |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His form at youth level caught the attention of interim [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Guus Hiddink]] who invited him to train with the senior team at the back end of the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deniran-Alleyne |first=Tashan (9 May 2016) |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/tammy-abraham-training-with-chelseas-first-team-report/665894 |title=Tammy Abraham training with Chelsea's first-team – report |website=Squawka |accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2016, Hiddink handed Abraham his Chelsea debut in a 1–1 [[Premier League]] draw with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], bringing him on to replace [[Bertrand Traoré]] in the 74th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/how-tammy-abraham-capitalised-on-antonio-conte-s-tactical-advice-to-fire-his-way-into-chelsea-s-a3424506.html |title=How Tammy Abraham capitalised on Antonio Conte's tactical advice to fire his way into Chelsea's first team plans |newspaper=London Evening Standard |last=Bhardwaj |first=Vaishali |date=20 December 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham then made his home debut at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] the following week, once again coming on as a second-half [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for Traoré in a 1–1 draw with newly-crowned Premier League Champions [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref name=Goal /&gt;

On 5 August 2016, Abraham signed for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on a season-long [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36985799 |title=Tammy Abraham: Bristol City sign Chelsea forward on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 August 2016 |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club the following day, coming off the bench for fellow debutant [[Josh Brownhill]] to score City's first goal in a 2–1 come-from-behind win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], although the goal was later credited to [[Hörður Björgvin Magnússon|Hörður Magnússon]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2016/09/29/tammy-abraham-three-performances-that-show-why-striker-is-pfa-pl/ |title=Tammy Abraham: Three performances that show why striker is PFA Player of the Month |website=HITC |last=Feehan |first=Katie |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started in his second game and scored the only goal of the match in a 1–0 win over [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], helping Bristol City advance to the Second Round of the [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36949819 |title=Tammy Abraham scored his second goal in two Bristol City games |date=9 August 2016 |accessdate=2 January 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, on 13 August, he scored his first professional brace in a 2–1 victory over newly promoted [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]], including the last-minute winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Burton Albion 1–2 Bristol City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36993972 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2016 |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Abraham scored his second brace against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], although Bristol City ultimately lost 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37282509 |title=Sheffield Wednesday 3–2 Bristol City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a further two goals during the month which saw him named Championship Player of the Month for September.&lt;ref name=potm&gt;{{cite news |last=Rathborn |first=Jack (29 September 2016) |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/tammy-abraham-wins-championship-player-8938878 |title=Tammy Abraham wins Championship Player of the Month as Bristol City boss jokes over permanent move |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[EFL Young Player of the Month]] award for September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37755928 |last=Garry |first=Tom |title=Tammy Abraham: EFL Young Player award for Bristol City's on-loan Chelsea striker |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2016 |accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2017, Abraham scored his 16th Championship goal in a 2–2 draw against Sheffield Wednesday, which saw him break the record of former [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] striker [[Moussa Dembélé (French footballer)|Moussa Dembélé]] for the most goals scored by a teenager since the beginning of the Football League Championship era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-za/news/tammy-abraham-is-the-record-breaking-teenager-the-future-of/wqygm5ptmqhi1dwhcjlqbono2 |title=Tammy Abraham: Is the record-breaking teenager the future of Chelsea? |publisher=Goal.com |date=20 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham ended the season with 23 goals to his name, second only to [[Chris Wood (footballer, born 1991)|Chris Wood]] of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], as City completed the campaign in 17th position, thereby avoiding relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/07/bristol-city-fans-gutted-to-see-chelsea-loan-star-tammy-abraham-play-final-game-for-club-6621079/ |title=Bristol City fans gutted to see Chelsea loan star Tammy Abraham play final game for club |newspaper=Metro |location=London |last=Barry |first=Coral |date=7 May 2017 |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances throughout the season also earned him Bristol City's Player of the Year, Young Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards.

On 28 November, he scored four goals in a 5–5 draw with [[Nottingham Forest F.C|Nottingham Forest]] in the league; the first time a draw of that score had ever been played out to at [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/28/tammy-abraham-scores-four-as-aston-villa-draw-5-5-with-nottingham-forest |title=Tammy Abraham scores four as Aston Villa draw 5–5 with Nottingham Forest |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 November 2018 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he became the first Aston Villa player to score four goals in a single match in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/outstanding-tammy-abraham-named-championship-player-of-the/27qgcnwdwjmx1ku2mwjnxpv0s |title=Outstanding Tammy Abraham named Championship Player of the Month |publisher=Goal |last=Taiwo|first=Taiye |date=7 December 2018 |accessdate=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later named Championship Player of the Month for November after scoring six goals in four appearances for the month.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

By the turn of the year, Abraham had scored 16 goals in 20 appearances and was the joint-top goalscorer in the league. His strong form sparked speculation that he would be recalled by Chelsea, who retained the option until 14 January 2018, given the club's own goal scoring troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/recalling-tammy-abraham-would-confirm-chelsea/1jwwy9i1o3nir1y1tcvge9e95i|title=Recalling Tammy Abraham would confirm Chelsea thoughtlessness|publisher=Goal|last=Omidiora|first=Seye|date=29 December 2018|accessdate=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/01/03/chelsea-decide-tammy-abrahams-future-january-14/|title=Chelsea to decide on Tammy Abraham's future by January 14|publisher=The Telegraph|last=Percy|first=John|date=3 January 2019|accessdate=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later became apparent that Premier League side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had also made an approach for his signature, although [[FIFA]]'s rules prohibiting a player from representing three clubs in a season cast doubt over any potential move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/wolves-transfer-news-tammy-abraham-latest-chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league-fifa-a8711736.html|title=Wolves remain confident of signing Tammy Abraham from Chelsea despite possible complications|publisher=The Independent|last=Mashiter|first=Nick|date=4 January 2019|accessdate=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a week of media speculation surrounding his future, Abraham rejected a loan move to Wolves in favour of staying with Villa for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/08/tammy-abraham-snubs-wolves-loan-move-stay-aston-villa-transfer-window-football|title=Tammy Abraham snubs Wolves loan to stay and help Villa promotion push|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 January 2019|accessdate=9 January 2019|last=James|first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/i-felt-here-was-home-tammy-abraham-opens-up-on-aston-villa/1c1f1dnkdwea212yu27si79zxs|title='I felt here was home' - Tammy Abraham opens up on Aston Villa decision|publisher=Goal|last=Taiwo|first=Taiye|date=4 February 2019|accessdate=14 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January, he scored a brace in a 2–1 win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] and in doing so became the first player since [[Pongo Waring]] in 1933 to score in seven consecutive home games for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46928848|title=Aston Villa 2–1 Ipswich|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 January 2019|accessdate=27 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he became the first player since [[Peter Withe]] in 1981 to score 20 goals for the club in a single season when he scored in a 3–3 come–from–behind draw with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/20-goal-tammy-abraham-backed-to-lead-aston-villas-promotion/1jdom91itsepy1r9iwdjr5bbx4|title=20-goal Tammy Abraham backed to lead Aston Villa’s promotion push|publisher=Goal|last=Taiwo|first=Taiye|date=13 February 2019|accessdate=14 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Despite being an [[England national youth football team|England youth international]], and having featured in non-competitive fixtures for the senior team, Abraham remains eligible to represent [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] through his paternal lineage and was in the past sounded out by the Nigerian Football Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Emmanuel |first=Ifeanyi (7 July 2016) |url=http://www.allnigeriasoccer.com/read_news.php?nid=19669 |title=Officials Hold Talks With Chelsea Striker Tammy Abraham, Dad Over Playing For Nigeria |website=All Nigeria Soccer |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham's father is close friends with [[Nigeria Football Federation]] President, [[Amaju Pinnick]] and on 21 September 2017, Pinnick claimed that Abraham had switched his allegiance to Nigeria. Abraham issued a statement the same day denying the claim and reaffirming his availability for England selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/21/tammy-abraham-chelsea-nigeria-england-switch |title=Chelsea's Tammy Abraham denies he is set to switch allegiance to Nigeria |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |last=Aarons |first=Ed |date=21 September 2017 |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving his first England call-up in November 2017, Abraham stated that there was never any prospect of him choosing to play for Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwese.espn.com/football/swansea-city/story/3262129/swansea-forward-tammy-abraham-firmly-committed-to-england |title=Swansea forward Tammy Abraham firmly committed to England |publisher=ESPN |last=Miller |first=Nick |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Youth===
Abraham has represented England at both [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] and [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] level. He scored his first goals at age group level for England in March 2015, netting a brace as England U18 defeated [[Switzerland national under-18 football team|Switzerland]] 6–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stonehouse |first=Gary |date=28 March 2015 |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/development/2015/mar/tammy-abraham-keep-on-scoring-england-u18s-v-switzerland-280315 |title=Tammy Abraham: 'I've just got to keep on scoring' |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, while representing the U19 team in a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] against [[Japan national under-19 football team|Japan]], Abraham and teammate [[Patrick Roberts]] played a game of [[rock–paper–scissors]] on the pitch to decide who would take a penalty. Abraham was triumphant but missed the resultant spot-kick. Just a minute later, however, Roberts assisted Abraham for the second goal of the match, which ultimately ended 5–1 in England's favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olver |first=Tom (15 November 2015) |url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/11/15/tammy-abraham-and-patrick-roberts-play-rock-paper-scissors-to-decide-penalty-taker-for-england-under-19s-5503761/ |title=Tammy Abraham and Patrick Roberts play rock, paper, scissors to decide penalty taker for England Under-19s |newspaper=Metro |location=London |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 2016, Abraham was one of four Chelsea players named in [[Aidy Boothroyd]]'s [[2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship squads#England|squad]] for the [[UEFA European Under-19 Championship|U19 European Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/jul/06/under-19s-euro-squad-named-060716 |title=England U19s squad named for Euros Challenge |publisher=The Football Association |last=Veevers |first=Nicholas |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in three out of four matches as England were eliminated by [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italy]] in the [[semi-final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/jul/21/italy-report-210716 |title=England U-19s' Euro dreams ended by Italy in semi-final |publisher=The Football Association |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham also received his first [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] call-up on 29 September 2016. He made his first appearance for the team on 6 October, coming on as a substitute with eight minutes remaining against [[Kazakhstan national under-21 football team|Kazakhstan]] in a qualifier for the U21 European Championships to help England to a 1–0 victory which secured the nation's progression to the tournament proper. He made his full debut for the U21s in their final group stage match against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and netted twice in a 5–0 victory for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/england-u21-vs-bosnia-and-herzegovina-u21/338970 |title=England U21s 5–0 Bosnia-Herzegovina U21s: Tammy Abraham nets brace in convincing win |publisher=Sky Sports |last=Yew |first=Oliver |date=11 October 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, he was named in the [[2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship squads#England|England squad]] for the [[2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/jun/05/england-u21s-euro-squad-selected-050617 |title=U21's Euros Squad Selected |publisher=The Football Association |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=20 June 2017 |last=Veevers |first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first, and only goal for the tournament in the semi-final against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]]. England ultimately lost the match after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], with Abraham one of the players who missed his spot-kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10934481/tammy-abraham-to-swansea-why-the-chelsea-striker-will-be-a-success |title=Tammy Abraham to Swansea: Why the Chelsea striker will be a success |publisher=Sky Sports |last=Bate |first=Adam |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2018, having been omitted from [[2018 FIFA World Cup squads#England|England's squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Abraham was recalled to the [[2018 Toulon Tournament squads#England|under-20 side]] for the [[Toulon Tournament]] in France where they had been drawn in a group alongside [[Qatar national under-20 football team|Qatar]], China and [[Mexico national under-20 football team|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44154538 |title=How I found out about my England call-up |publisher=BBC |date=17 May 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Football Association |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018 |title=England U21s head to Maurice Revello Tournament in Toulon with a 20-man squad |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/may/18/england-u21s-squad-named-for-toulon-180518}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, England opened their title defence with a 2–1 win over China in which Abraham scored the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tammy Abraham rescues England in Toulon opener |first=Matt |last=Reed |date=27 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |publisher=NBC Sports |url=https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2018/05/27/tammy-abraham-rescues-england-in-toulon-opener/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not feature in the subsequent match against Mexico but returned to score in a 4–0 win over Qatar which saw England qualify for the semi-finals where they were drawn against [[Scotland national under-20 football team|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toulon Tournament: England and Mexico play out draw in France |date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44297181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779012-england-fail-to-secure-automatic-toulon-qualification-despite-big-win-over-qatar |title=England Fail to Secure Automatic Toulon Qualification Despite Big Win over Qatar |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Jones |first=Matt |date=1 June 2018 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/06/05/england-u21-manager-says-semi-final-spot-toulon-tournament-minimum/ |title=England U21 manager says semi-final spot at Toulon Tournament is minimum target, but warns against complacency |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |last=Edwards |first=Luke |date=5 June 2018 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham was only used as a late substitute as England defeated Scotland but was selected to start in the final where they met Mexico. There he was unlucky not to score, hitting the post in the second half, but helped England claim their third successive title with a 2–1 win.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44426516 |title=Toulon Tournament: England U21s secure third successive title with 2–1 win over Mexico |publisher=BBC |last=O'Keefe |first=Greg |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
On 2 November 2017, Abraham was one of three uncapped players called up to the senior [[England national football team|England]] team for [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendlies]] against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwese.espn.com/football/england/story/3255581/joe-gomez-ruben-loftus-cheek-and-tammy-abraham-get-england-call-ups |title=Joe Gomez, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham get England call-ups |publisher=ESPN |date=2 November 2017 |accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England: Tammy Abraham, Joe Gomez &amp; Ruben Loftus-Cheek called up |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41848591 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 November 2017 |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against the former on 10 November, starting in a 0–0 draw at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 0–0 Germany |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41854505 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Abraham was born in [[Camberwell]], London.&lt;ref name=11v11/&gt; He has a younger brother, Timmy, who is also a footballer and plays in the academy system at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/05/25/fulham-sign-chelsea-striker-tammy-abrahams-brother-timmy |title=Timmy Abraham, brother of Chelsea foward &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Tammy |newspaper=HITC |location=London |last=Brown |first=Christian |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-stars-younger-brother-joins-13089934 |title=Chelsea star's younger brother joins Fulham after impressing on trial |website=Get West London |last=O'Donovan |first=Ryan |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Abraham was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on loan at Bristol City. At the time of the accident he was alleged to have been driving without a licence or insurance, and was summoned to court as a result. He later obtained his licence, passing the test in March of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/tammy-abraham-passes-driving-test-10765 |title=Tammy Abraham passes driving test two months after allegedly being caught without a licence |newspaper=Bristol Post |last=Ashcroft |first=Esme |date=20 March 2017 |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
