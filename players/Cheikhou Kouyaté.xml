===Early career===
Kouyaté began his footballing career in 1996 in his hometown with ASC Yego Dakar and was scouted by [[RWDM Brussels FC|RWDM Brussels]] in September 2006. RWDM Brussels then signed the player in January the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html FC BRUSSELS Players] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430152814/http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html |date=30 April 2009 }} on www.rwdm-brussels.be&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to play ten league appearances for the first team between 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="whufc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |title=CHEIKHOU KOUYATE |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=1 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115021426/http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |archivedate=15 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anderlecht===
As Kouyaté turned 19, he left Brussels because his former employers did not pay him three months' worth of wages. He subsequently moved to Belgian rivals [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] on a four-year deal for a free transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=T31U96TG Cheikhou Kouyaté moet van de rechter naar Anderlecht] on www.nieuwsblad.be&lt;/ref&gt; Kouyaté went on to make 153 league appearances for Anderlecht, scoring four goals in five seasons at the club. He won the [[2009–10 Belgian Pro League|2009–10]], [[2011-12 Belgian Pro League|2011–12]], [[2012-13 Belgian Pro League|2012–13]] and [[2013–14 Belgian Pro League|2013–14]] [[Belgian Pro League|league titles]] as well as the 2010–11, 2012–13 and 2013–14 [[Belgian Super Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=whufc1/&gt;&lt;ref name = Soccerway&gt;{{Soccerway|-cheikhou-kouyate/53112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
