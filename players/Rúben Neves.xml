==Club career==
===Porto===
Born in [[Mozelos (Santa Maria da Feira)]], [[Aveiro District]], Neves grew up supporting [[FC Porto]] and joined the club's youth system at the age of 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/21/ruben-neves-diogo-jota-wolves-porto-cricket-interview|title=Wolves’ Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota: ‘Porto has wine, food but here it’s fine’|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Stuart|last=James|date=21 September 2018|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PortuGoal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portugoal.net/on-the-rise/356-profile-of-porto-prodigy-ruben-neves|title=Profile of Porto prodigy Rúben Neves|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the academy, he also spent a season on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at [[Padroense F.C.|Padroense]] which acted as the under-16 side;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2132818.html|title=The rapid rise of Rúben Neves|publisher=UEFA|last=Pimentel|first=José Nuno|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his time in the youth structures, [[FC Porto B|reserve team]] manager [[Luís Castro (Portuguese footballer)|Luís Castro]] described him as a player with "extraordinary mental qualities, to go along with technical and tactical skills".&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;

Ahead of the [[2014–15 Primeira Liga|2014–15 campaign]], Neves was earmarked to bypass Porto's under-19s and play with the reserves instead. Following an injury to teammate [[Mikel Agu]], however, he was called by [[Julen Lopetegui]] to be part of the main squad's pre-season preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-tem-um-talento-mental-extraordinario-4070889.html|title=Rúben Neves tem um talento mental extraordinário|trans-title=Rúben Neves has an extraordinary mental talent|newspaper=[[O Jogo]]|language=pt|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2014, aged 17 years and five months, he made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut where he started and scored in a 2–0 home win against [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]] – in doing so, he became the youngest player in the club's history to score a goal in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/liga-fc-porto-maritimo-cronica/53ee72880cf2c1dfdf15bb68.html|title=FC Porto-Marítimo, 2–0 (crónica)|trans-title=FC Porto-Marítimo, 2–0 (report)|publisher=Mais Futebol|last=Almeida|first=Germano|language=pt|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first match in the [[UEFA Champions League]] five days later in a 1–0 win over [[Lille OSC|Lille]], and broke another record (previously held by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) by being the youngest Portuguese to appear in the tournament.&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/liga-campeoes-fc-porto-ruben-neves-cristiano-ronaldo-lille-play-off/53f4eee90cf2103fd4482b11.html|title=Rúben Neves o português mais novo de sempre a jogar na ''Champions''|trans-title=Rúben Neves the youngest Portuguese ever to play in the Champions|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=20 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2014, during a [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group stage]] fixture against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], Neves suffered an injury to his right knee following a collision in midfield with [[Alex Teixeira]]. At the end of the game, the club explained that he suffered a sprain, with apparent damage to the internal lateral ligament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-com-lesao-no-joelho-direito-4288722.html|title=Rúben Neves com lesão no joelho direito|trans-title=Rúben Neves with right knee injury|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending nearly a month on the sidelines, he returned to the pitch in a [[2014–15 Taça da Liga|3–1 home win]] over [[C.F. União|União da Madeira]] in the [[Taça da Liga]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/fc-porto/detalhe/ruben-neves-regressa-aos-convocados-924835.html|title=Rúben Neves regressa aos convocados|trans-title=Rúben Neves returns to squad|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his injury, his role in midfield was filled by [[Casemiro]] and he spent the majority of the remainder of the season behind the Brazilian in the pecking order.&lt;ref name=PortuGoal/&gt;

On 20 October 2015, aged 18 years and 221 days, Neves became the youngest player to start as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in the Champions League, helping Porto to a 2–0 win against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] in [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|the group phase]] and surpassing previous record holder [[Rafael van der Vaart]], who held it since 16 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2296033.html|title=Porto's Rúben Neves, Iker Casillas make history|publisher=UEFA|date=20 October 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, in a 2–1 success over [[F.C. Paços de Ferreira|Paços de Ferreira]] also at the [[Estádio do Dragão]], he broke another record by becoming the youngest player to achieve 50 games for the club, surpassing players like [[Fernando Gomes (footballer)|Fernando Gomes]] and [[Jaime Magalhães]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/ruben-neves-e-o-mais-jovem-a-completar-50-jogos-4917762.html|title=Rúben Neves é o mais jovem a completar 50 jogos|trans-title=Rúben Neves is the youngest to complete 50 games|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=6 December 2015|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves scored his second competitive goal on 3 February 2016, opening the scoreline in a 3–0 triumph at [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]] for [[2015–16 Taça de Portugal|the semi-finals]] of the [[Taça de Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/porto/noticias/interior/nunca-e-facil-mudar-de-estrategia-5014013.html|title=Nunca é fácil mudar de estratégia|trans-title="It is never easy to change strategy"|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
On 8 July 2017, [[EFL Championship]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] announced that they had signed Neves for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £15.8 million – a club and league record fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20170708-neves-arrives/|title=Neves arrives!|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=8 July 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining, he was reunited with former Porto manager [[Nuno Espírito Santo]].&lt;ref name=Fifty&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/first-team/20181010-50-games-of-neves-a-look-back/|title=50 games of Neves: A look back|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=10 October 2018|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on 15 August, in a 3–2 away win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40858331|title=Hull City 2–3 Wolverhampton Wanderers|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 August 2017|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Neves was nominated for the EFL Championship Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards, and was also included in the Team of the Season along with teammates [[Conor Coady]] and [[John Ruddy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43641225|title=EFL awards: Tom Cairney, Ruben Neves &amp; Ryan Sessgenon on Championship shortlist|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 April 2018|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team was ultimately [[2017–18 EFL Championship|promoted as champions]] with the player scoring six goals in 42 appearances, all of which were scored from outside of the box;&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-wolves-richarlison-ruben-neves-goals-report-a8488566.html|title=Richarlison and Ruben Neves ready to lead by example for Everton and Wolves|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|last=Nash|first=Tim|date=13 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/693584|title=FPL promotion prospects: The Wolves worth hunting|publisher=[[Premier League]]|date=27 May 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the conclusion of the campaign, he claimed a hat-trick of club awards as he walked away with the Player of the Season, Player's Player of the Season and Goal of the Season accolades.&lt;ref name=Fifty/&gt;

==International career==

For his performances, he was named among the top ten talents of the tournament by a selection of [[UEFA]] reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=2106764.html|title=Ten under-17 players to keep an eye on|publisher=UEFA|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2014, still aged 17, Neves was called by coach [[Rui Jorge]] to be part of the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21 side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/seleccao/euro_sub_21/artigo/2014/08/29/portugal-sub-21-sporting-domina-convocat-ria-ruben-neves-chamado|title=Sporting domina convocatória, Ruben Neves chamado|trans-title=Sporting dominate list, Ruben Neves called|publisher=[[SAPO (company)|SAPO]]|language=pt|date=29 August 2014|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal on 14 October, helping to a 5–4 home win against the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]] for [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification|the playoff round]] of the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000413/match=2015238/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Portugal through after nine-goal thriller|publisher=UEFA|date=14 October 2014|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the finals began in the Czech Republic, Neves broke a new record by becoming the youngest player to debut for the Portuguese under-21s in the tournament, aged 18 years and three months, playing five minutes to help beat [[England national under-21 football team|England]] 1–0 in the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship#Group B|group stage]] opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/seleccao/portugal/artigo/2015/06/19/ruben-neves-quebra-recorde-mas-quer-mais-nao-posso-abrandar|title=Rúben Neves quebra recorde mas quer mais: "Não posso abrandar"|trans-title=Ruben Neves breaks record but wants more: "I can't slow down"|publisher=SAPO|language=pt|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his only appearance, as the country reached [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship Final|the final]] and lost it to [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name=UEFA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/matches/round=2000411/match=2015383/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Spot-on Sweden beat Portugal to win U21 EURO|publisher=UEFA|last=Kell|first=Tom|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves was first called up to [[Portugal national football team|the senior squad]] on 10 November 2015, ahead of [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] as an injury replacement for [[João Moutinho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/618334/Liverpool-Chelsea-Ruben-Neves-Porto-international-debut-Portugal|title=Liverpool and Chelsea target in high demand as youngster set to make international debut|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|last=Gray|first=James|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in the former match, featuring 17 minutes in the 0–1 loss in [[Krasnodar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/news/newsid=2304930.html|title=Rússia vence Portugal em Krasnodar|trans-title=Russia beat Portugal in Krasnodar|publisher=UEFA|language=pt|date=14 November 2015|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then played the entire 2–0 win against the latter at the [[Stade Josy Barthel]], sharing the midfield area with Porto teammates [[Danilo Pereira (Portuguese footballer)|Danilo Pereira]] and [[André André]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/selecao/andre-andre/luxemburgo-portugal-2-0-cronica|title=Luxemburgo-Portugal, 0–2 (crónica)|trans-title=Luxembourg-Portugal, 0–2 (report)|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/internacional/selecao/noticias/interior/aproveitamos-o-meiocampo-do-fc-porto-4889964.html|title=Aproveitamos o meio-campo do FC Porto|trans-title=We took advantage of the FC Porto midfield|newspaper=O Jogo|language=pt|date=17 November 2015|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neves was selected by full side manager [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] to a preliminary 35-man squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad – 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced?|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not make the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/portugal-world-cup-squad|title=Nearly half Portugal's Euro squad to miss World Cup|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
