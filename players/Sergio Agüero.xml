'''Sergio Leonel Agüero''' ({{IPA-es|ˈseɾxjo le.oˈnel aˈɣweɾo}}; born 2 June 1988) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]].

Agüero began his career at [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]]. On 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to play in the [[Argentine Primera División]] on his debut at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by [[Diego Maradona]] in [[Seasons in Argentine football|1976]]. In 2006, he moved to Europe to play for [[La Liga]] side [[Atlético Madrid]], for a transfer fee of €23 million and made a name for himself, attracting attention from Europe's top clubs by scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances while winning the [[UEFA Europa League]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in 2010.

Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for [[List of most expensive association football transfers|an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million]]. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Best goal ratios of Premier League players |url=https://www.premierleague.com/gallery/111326 |work=Premier League |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The best Opta Stats from Saturday's Premier League games |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10016044/the-best-opta-stats-from-saturdays-premier-league-games |work=Sky Sports |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Agüero became [[List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics#All-time top goalscorers|Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer]], scoring his 178th City goal against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41710035 |title=Aguero: More than just a record goalscorer |date=2 November 2017 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero is currently the 8th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with over [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|100 goals in the division]].

At international level, Agüero represented the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20 team]] at the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|2005]] and in [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2007]], winning both tournaments.&lt;ref name=rise/&gt; He played at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Beijing Olympics]], scoring two goals in the 3–0 semi-final win against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] as Argentina went on to win the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/argentina-3-brazil-0-argentina-in-final-after-routing-arch-rivals-902777.html |title=Argentina 3 Brazil 0: Argentina in final after routing arch rivals – Olympics, Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |location=London |first1=Nick |last1=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero was selected to represent Argentina in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2011 Copa América]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa América]], and the [[Copa América Centenario]], reaching the finals of the latter three tournaments. He also participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], where he scored his first and second World Cup goals for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].

He wears "Kun" on his shirt, a childhood nickname based on the title character from the cartoon [[Kum-Kum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-aguero-on-how-kun-4501690|author=Sergio Aguero|title=Sergio Aguero on.. how he got his "Kun" nickname and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- note: source does not explicitly name the cartoon, but it names the character and describes the caveman setting --&gt;

==Club career==
===Independiente===
Sergio Agüero joined the youth system of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] at the age of nine. He started playing for the side, becoming the youngest player to debut in the division at 15 years and 35 days (on 5 July 2003 against [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro]]), when Independiente's coach, [[Oscar Ruggeri]] sent Agüero onto the field as a substitute for [[Emanuel Benito Rivas|Emanuel Rivas]] in the 69th minute of the match.&lt;ref name=rise&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384547.stm |title=The Rise of Sergio Aguero |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/23/millones/menor/edad/elpepidep/20060601elpepidep_1/Tes |title=23 millones por un menor de edad |work=El País |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2012 |language=Spanish |last1=Borasteros |first1=Daniel |last2=Casar |first2=Alejandro}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was well received by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/07/06/d-06215.htm |title=San Lorenzo, de la galera |work=Clarín |date=6 July 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |language=Spanish |last=Castillo |first=Hernán}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/2003/07/06/c-585306.htm |title=Diario Deportivo Olé – Pájaro de buen Agüero |publisher=Old.ole.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/509319-muy-frio-san-lorenzo-gano-un-clasico-pobre |title=Muy frío: San Lorenzo ganó un clásico pobre – 06.07.2003 |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his early debut, he was not selected again by Ruggeri, and his replacement [[Osvaldo Sosa]], for the remainder of [[2002–03 Argentine Primera División|2002–03 season]], having made only one appearance in the [[2002–03 in Argentine football|Torneo Clausura]]. Following the arrival of coach [[Jose Omar Pastoriza]], seven months after Agüero's first match he returned to the club's first-team in 4–2 win against [[Peru|Peru's]] [[Cienciano]] during the group stages of the [[2004 Copa Libertadores]]. This meant that he also became the youngest player to participate in the [[Copa Libertadores]], a record that he held for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=341620 |title=La Crónica de Hoy &amp;#124; Prematuro debut, ¿el prólogo de una gran carrera? |publisher=Cronica.com.mx |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, Agüero again featured in a Copa Libertadores fixture against [[Ecuador|Ecuador's]] [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|El Nacional]]. On 19 June, for the first time, Agüero played a full 90-minute match for Independiente against [[Atlético de Rafaela]] during the [[2003–04 Argentine Primera División|Torneo Clausura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/ctematicos/clausura2004/partido/2388.shtml |title=Deportes " Torneo Clausura 2004 |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Independiente in a 2–2 draw against [[Estudiantes de la Plata|Estudiantes]] on 26 November, with a 22nd minute shot from outside the penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/ctematicos/apertura2004/partido/2661.shtml |title=Deportes " Torneo Clausura 2004 |publisher=Terra |date=26 November 2004 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abcpedia.com/deporte/sergio-kun-aguero.html |title=Biografia (Spanish) |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero became a regular in the club's first-team, being selected for the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina U-20 squad]] for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], which Argentina won.

During the [[2005–06 in Argentine football|2005–06 season]], Agüero scored 18 goals in 36 league appearances, having missed two games due to suspension. In a 4–0 win against [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] on 11 September, he dribbled from inside of his own half and scored Independiente's fourth goal with a left footed shot.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independiente1905.com.ar/noticias/noti_29.htm |title=Sergio Agüero, El Demonio Rojo |publisher=Independiente1905.com.ar |date=13 September 2005 |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425083032/http://www.independiente1905.com.ar/noticias/noti_29.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first red card came in the Torneo Apertura, after slapping an opponent in a match against [[Tiro Federal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/apertura05/partido/2987.shtml |title=Deportes &gt; Torneo apertura 2005 |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His outstanding performances during the [[2005–06 Argentine Primera División|Torneo Apertura]] attracted interest from a number of large European clubs, and, after months of speculation, Agüero announced on TV in April that he intended to leave the club at the end of the season. Before the end of the season, there had already been speculation of a possible transfer to [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; With his performances being lauded by the press, there was talk of a possible call up for Agüero for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=427233 |title=Suma goles, suma apoyo popular – Mundial2006 – ESPN Deportes |publisher=Espndeportes.espn.go.com |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=443923 |title=Tres nombres que no hubieran faltado – Mundial2006 – ESPN Deportes |publisher=Espndeportes.espn.go.com |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/788856-aguero-todos-piden-por-el |title=Agüero: todos piden por él – 15.03.2006 |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date=15 March 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2–0 away victory against [[Olimpo de Bahia Blanca]] in round 17 of the Torneo Clausura, Agüero received his fifth yellow card of the season. This prevented him from playing his last game for Independiente in a fixture against [[Boca Juniors]] in [[Avellaneda]] one week later. The yellow card brought tears to his eyes, as television cameras recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/clausura06/partido/3356.shtml |title=Deportes &gt; Torneo Clausura 2006 |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero, who scored Independiente's second goal of the match later said "I think that it was my last goal for Independiente". He played his last game for Independiente, two weeks later, in a 2–0 away defeat to [[Rosario Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/clausura06/partido/3376.shtml |title=Deportes &gt; Torneo Clausura 2006 |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May, Agüero officially transferred to Atlético Madrid for €20 million, marking a record for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/352663.html |title=Agüero, el juvenil récord del futbol argentino – El Universal – Deportes |publisher=El Universal |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlético Madrid===
====2006–07 season====
[[File:SergioAgüero.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Agüero playing for Atlético Madrid in October 2007.]]
In May 2006, Agüero joined Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]] for a fee reported to be around €20 million, breaking the club's previous transfer record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369484&amp;cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |title=Atlético agree fee for Independiente starlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369713&amp;cc=4716 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |title=Atlético sign Argentine prodigy Agüero}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caused controversy early in his Atlético career by using his hands to score the winning goal against [[Recreativo de Huelva]] on 14 October 2006, only his second goal for the club, with the first coming in a 4–1 away win against [[Athletic Bilbao]] on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=204980&amp;cc=null&amp;league=ESP.1 |publisher=ESPN |title=Atlético Madrid 2–1 Recreativo Huelva}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his first season in Madrid with seven goals in all competitions, eased into European football by manager [[Javier Aguirre]], who opted to bring him in and out of the line-up as Atlético finished seventh, enough to qualify for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

====2007–08 season====
Following the departure of strike partner [[Fernando Torres]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the summer of 2007, Agüero secured his starting spot for the ''Rojiblancos'' and soon became arguably the team's most important player at the age of just 19. In the [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08 season]], he finished third highest scorer in [[La Liga]], behind [[Daniel Güiza]] and [[Luís Fabiano]], with 19 goals, and was runner up in the ''[[Trofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202736803447/noticia/Noticia/Raul_wins_the_Di_Stefano_Trophy.htm |publisher=Real Madrid |title=Marca names the Madridista captain the best player of the league |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630053840/http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202736803447/noticia/Noticia/Raul_wins_the_Di_Stefano_Trophy.htm |archivedate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero won many plaudits for his [[man of the match]] display against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in March 2008, scoring twice, assisting a goal and winning a penalty for Atlético in a 4–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/03/europeanfootball.barcelona |publisher=The Guardian |title=A masterclass from Atlético Madrid's Sergio Agüero dented Barcelona's title hopes and made several Catalan headline-writers look very foolish indeed |location=London |first=Sid |last=Lowe |date=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sergio Aguero – Readers Q&amp;A |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384770.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored important goals against the likes of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] to help Atlético finish fourth and qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2008/May/12/atletico-de-madrid-confirm-return-to-europes-elite |title=Atletico de Madrid confirm return to Europe's elite |date=12 May 2008 |work=soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]] was arguably Agüero's most successful for Atlético, as he scored 20 league goals for the first time in his career.

Five straight wins helped City wipe out the eight-point deficit against United, and they went into the final day's fixtures leading on goal difference. Facing relegation-threatened [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], City needed to match or better United's result at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. By the 66th minute, QPR's [[Joey Barton]] was sent off after elbowing Agüero's teammate, [[Carlos Tevez]] in the face. Eventually after being shown the red card, Barton proceeded to kick Agüero's knee, then attempted to attack [[Vincent Kompany]], only for him to be held back by Micah Richards.

On 18 October 2014, he scored all four of City's goals in a 4–1 home win over Tottenham, two of which were penalties; he took another penalty in the match, but it was saved by [[Hugo Lloris]].

During City's 2–0 victory away at Everton on 23 August, Agüero halted the game after noticing that an Everton supporter was in need of emergency treatment.

On 8 October, in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2018 World Cup qualifying match]] against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], Agüero sustained a hamstring injury early on and was carried off the pitch in tears.

On 16 April 2016, Agüero scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win at Chelsea, ending with a penalty kick.

In a league match against West Ham on 28 August, Agüero struck opponent [[Winston Reid]] in the throat with his arm, an incident which went unpunished by the referee. Reid lost his voice with the strike, and had to be substituted. The FA gave Agüero a three-match ban for violent conduct, accusing him of behaving in an "aggressive manner that was excessive in force and brutal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37363867 |title=Sergio Aguero: Foul on Winston Reid 'brutal and aggressive', says FA commission |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Sergio Agüero 2011-09-08 001.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo for [[Puma AG]], September 2011]]
Agüero was married to Gianinna Maradona, the youngest daughter of Argentine footballer [[Diego Maradona]]. On 19 February 2009, Gianinna gave birth to their son, Benjamín, in [[Madrid]]. Diego Maradona was there for the birth of his first grandson, while Agüero, then 20, missed Atlético's training session earlier in the day. Atlético offered their congratulations in a statement on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/02/19/soccer-maradona-idUKLJ7605820090219 |title=Maradona a grandfather thanks to Atletico's Aguero |date=19 February 2009 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=30 October 2015 |last=Elkington |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero and Gianinna separated in 2012 after four years together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Todd |last=Fitzgerald |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-citys-sergio-aguero-splits-1209630 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |title=Manchester City's Sergio Aguero splits from wife of four years |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agüero's nickname "Kun", which features on his shirt, dates back to his childhood. It was first given to him by his grandparents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2027348/Sergio-Aguero-use-Kun-Manchester-City-shirt.html |title=Yes you Kun! New City star Aguero told he can use nickname on his shirt |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a resemblance to the character "[[Kum-Kum]]" from the anime [[Wanpaku Omukashi Kumu Kumu]] which was Agüero's favourite television programme as a child.&lt;ref name="kun" /&gt; He stated, "I have grown to appreciate it because it's unique. It's not every day an athlete is nicknamed after a cartoon character!"&lt;ref name="kun"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384547.stm |title=The rise of Sergio Aguero |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero has a tattoo on the inside of his right arm inscribed in [[Tengwar]]—a form of writing invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''—that transliterates roughly to ''Kun Agüero'' in the [[Latin script]]. He also has a tattoo on his left arm of his son's name and date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-aguero.htm |title=Sergio Agüero Tattoos |publisher=Vanishing Tattoo |accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agüero holds [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish nationality]], after being granted citizenship in 2010 whilst playing for [[Atlético Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11838/6551790/aguero-gains-eu-status |title=Aguero gains EU status |publisher=Sky Sports |date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agüero shares a close friendship with [[Lionel Messi]], his regular roommate during outings for the national team since 2005. He described Messi as being "like a brother" in his 2014 autobiography, ''Born to Rise'', which contains a foreword written by Messi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Ben |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29962472 |title=Sergio Aguero: Man City hero's journey from the 'cave of vipers' |date=8 November 2014 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi is the godfather of Aguero's son Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maston |first=Tom |publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]] |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/4160/extra-time/2012/11/13/3525665/extra-time-aguero-delivers-gift-for-thiago-messi |title=Extra Time: Aguero delivers gift for Thiago Messi |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
