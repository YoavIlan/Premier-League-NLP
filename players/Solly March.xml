'''Solomon Benjamin March''' (born 20 July 1994) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Brigh&amp;HA}} club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]].

==Early life==
March was born in [[Eastbourne]], East Sussex. His father, Steve, had been an apprentice footballer at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Griggs |first=Howard |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/9376461.Seagulls_swoop_for_Lewes_starlet/ |title=Seagulls swoop for Lewes starlet |newspaper=The Argus |location=Brighton |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; March attended secondary school at [[Ringmer Community College]] and [[St Bede's School, Eastbourne|St Bede's School]], [[Hailsham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bedes.org/alumni/news/news/2015/2015/06/solly-march-training-with-tony-morriss.aspx |title=Alumni: Bede's welcomes returning footballer Solomon March |first=Caroline |last=Harms |publisher=Bede's |date=26 June 2015 |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2012 March played cricket for Hellingly C.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bwmcc.play-cricket.com/website/player_stats_widget/batting_stats/265064?rule_type_id=179|title=Barnsley Woolley Miners CC|website=bwmcc.play-cricket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Lewes===
March played at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] between the ages of 11 and 13 and then switched from [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]] to fellow East Sussex club [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]] as a youth player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/media/7925/your-county-spring-2017-ebook.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 August 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825232505/https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/media/7925/your-county-spring-2017-ebook.pdf |archivedate=25 August 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solly March Report"/&gt; Lewes were playing in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division, and the 17-year-old March made his first-team debut on 10 September 2011, coming on in the 86th minute as a substitute against [[Aveley F.C.|Aveley]],&lt;ref name=LewesDebut&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://en.calameo.com/read/00000375303f7a57d3f4d |title=Match report Lewes 4:1 Aveley |first=Tom |last=Harper |magazine=The Rooks |publisher=Lewes F.C. |page=13 |date=24 September 2011 |via=Calaméo}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was offered a scholarship by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
===Early days at Brighton===
March signed a three-year contract with Brighton in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11741/7344289/seagulls-seal-non-league-swoop|title=Seagulls seal non-league swoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his transfer it was reported by the Brighton [[The Argus (Brighton)|Argus]] that March had also been offered a contract with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and a trial with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion snatched Solly March from under the nose of Newcastle|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/15107798.Albion_snatched_March_from_under_the_nose_of_Newcastle/|publisher=The Argus|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes manager Steve King suggested that March had been attracted to Brighton because of the style of football they were playing under manager [[Gus Poyet]] and because the move to another East Sussex club would allow him to remain close to his family.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While progressing through Brighton's youth squad, March quickly made an impact for the side and scored a hat–trick, in a 3–1 win over [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]]'s youth squad on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=March treble wins it for kids|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/9540044.March_treble_wins_it_for_kids/|publisher=The Argus|date=18 February 2012|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still a member of Brighton's development squad, 2013 saw the beginning of March's senior career. During the last half of the 2012–13 season, March made the bench for three senior Championship games but did not make an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion make two changes|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/10115587.Albion_make_two_changes/|publisher=The Argus|date=18 December 2012|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; March impressed in Brighton's youth squad, earning himself the team's Young Player of the Year Award 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2013/may/bridcutt-named-player-of-the-year/|title=Bridcutt Named Player of the Year|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|date=7 May 2013|accessdate=18 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817194852/https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2013/may/bridcutt-named-player-of-the-year/|archivedate=17 August 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a contract extension until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/albion/10433845.Four_youngsters_handed_new_deals/ |title=Four youngsters handed new deals (From The Argus) |publisher=Theargus.co.uk |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–14===
He then performed well in pre-season friendlies with the first team prior to the start of the 2013–14 season; highlighted with a 'superb' goal against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owen|first=Brian|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/10581198.March_strike_gives_Albion_a_draw/|title=March strike gives Albion a draw (From The Argus)|publisher=The Argus|date=30 July 2013|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; March was a named substitute in five of the first six games in the 2013–14 season and was substituted on in the 85th and 91st minutes against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solly on the March for Albion|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/10785667.Solly_on_the_March_for_Albion/|publisher=The Argus|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating his debut in Brighton's first team. Around November, March's first team opportunities became limited, leading to rumours that he's expected to be loaned out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion prospect could go out on loan|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/10833878.Albion_prospect_could_go_out_on_loan/|publisher=The Argus|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the move never happened and he stayed at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion prospect stays|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/10842933.Albion_prospect_stays/|publisher=The Argus|date=28 November 2013|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, March scored his first senior goal for the Albion in an FA Cup fourth round tie at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 25 January 2014. The game also saw [[Rohan Ince]] and [[Jon Obika]] score their first goals for the club in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Port Vale 1 – 3 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25789219|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the season, March was given a handful of first team opportunities, resulting him making 28 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion youngster surprised by rapid progress|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11006326.Albion_youngster_surprised_by_rapid_progress/|publisher=The Argus|date=13 February 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solly can march on for Seagulls|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11019617.Solly_can_march_on_for_Seagulls/|publisher=The Argus|date=19 February 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=March starts, Mackail-Smith on bench|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11129435.March_starts__Mackail_Smith_on_bench/|publisher=The Argus|date=5 April 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, March signed a new four-year deal with the ''Seagulls'' in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=March Buzzing Over Future|url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/solly-march-buzzing-at-long-term-brighton-hove-albion-future-1486668.aspx|work=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC |date=14 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415120436/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/solly-march-buzzing-at-long-term-brighton-hove-albion-future-1486668.aspx|archivedate=15 April 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–15===

To begin the 2014–15 season, March worked on improving his match fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fenelon starts as Albion hand out four debuts|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11399624.Fenelon_starts_as_Albion_hand_out_four_debuts/|publisher=The Argus|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his progress stalled as he suffered a lower back problem that would rule him out for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion concern about March injury|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11420365.Albion_concern_about_March_injury/|publisher=The Argus|date=20 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to training from injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Albion keeper allowed to stay put in Middle East as Stockdale returns|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11618035.Albion_keeper_allowed_to_stay_put_in_Middle_East_as_Stockdale_returns/|publisher=The Argus|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; March made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a second half substitute, in a 2–1 loss against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 29 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1 – 2 Fulham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30155731|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 November 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the club's second meeting against Fulham thirty days later, on 29 December 2014, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham 0 – 2 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30572357|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by setting up a goal for Rohan Ince, who scored the only goal of the game, in a win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlton Athletic 0 – 1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30663310|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; March went on to have a handful of first team appearances until February when he suffered a calf injury during a 3–2 loss against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 7 February 2015, in what turns out to be his last appearance of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hughton vows to look at loan market to end Albion's wing woes|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11782044.Hughton_vows_to_look_at_loan_market_to_end_Albion_s_wing_woes/|publisher=The Argus|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially out for weeks, March was eventually for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=March likely to miss rest of Albion's campaign|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/12866048.March_likely_to_miss_rest_of_Albion_s_campaign/|publisher=The Argus|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=March blow for Albion as they close in on Ledesma|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/11804251.March_blow_for_Albion_as_they_close_in_on_Ledesma/|publisher=The Argus|date=19 February 2015|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he went on to make 13 appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

==International career==
March was named by [[Gareth Southgate]] as a forward in the [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] squad in May 2014.

March typically plays on the wing either in midfield or as part of a forward line. Steve King, his former manager at Lewes, described March as a "technically very good" player who "has bags of energy, is a box-to-box player, has a good left foot, a good shot, he sees things early and the weight of his passes is very good."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solly March Report"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scout Report: Solly March|url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2017/05/18/scout-report-solly-march/|publisher=Outside of the Boot|date=18 May 2017|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
