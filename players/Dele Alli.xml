===Reception===
Alli is considered the world's most expensive midfielder from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/239/en/ |title=Updated transfer valuations: Mbappé takes the lead |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=5 November 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Alli was born in [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|22066|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Nigerian father Kehinde&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theeagleonline.com.ng/dele-alli-may-become-yoruba-king-fashanu/ |title=Dele Alli may become Yoruba king – Fashanu |publisher=Eagle News |date=2 May 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English mother Denise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Graeme |last1=Culliford |first2=Tracey |last2=Kandohla |date=6 April 2016 |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/80787/i-gave-dele-alli-away-at-13-to-save-him-from-gangs-and-allow-him-to-follow-his-football-dream/ |title=I gave Dele Alli away at 13 to save him from gangs and allow him to follow his football dream |newspaper=The Sun |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kehinde moved to the United States a week after Alli's birth.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jim |title=The Dele Alli story: How a tough upbringing inspired the rise of a Premier League superstar |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/03/05/the-dele-alli-story-how-a-tough-upbringing-inspired-the-rise-of/ |accessdate=12 August 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli was initially brought up by his mother, who suffered from alcohol problems.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"/&gt; At the age of nine, he moved to Nigeria with his father, where he spent two years in an [[international school]] before returning to Milton Keynes to live with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Hill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dele-allis-estranged-parents-issue-9918748 |title=Dele Alli's estranged parents' tearful plea for England star to let them back into his life |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |date=5 February 2018 |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alli went to [[Stantonbury Campus]]&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/mk-dons/11107393/Liverpool-and-Bayern-Munich-target-Dele-Alli-dances-to-his-own-tune-at-MK-Dons.html |title=Liverpool and Bayern Munich target Dele Alli dances to his own tune at MK Dons |date=18 September 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Radcliffe School]] in [[Wolverton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hytner |first1=David |title=Dele Alli: England's fearless street footballer who can take Euro 2016 by storm |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/09/dele-alli-england-euro-2016 |accessdate=5 May 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 13, he moved into the family home of Alan and Sally Hickford, parents of another young footballer with MK Dons and whom he refers to as his "adoptive parents" although he was never legally adopted by them.&lt;ref name="telegraph_story"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/dele-allis-mother-gave-tottenham-7151123 |title=Dele Alli's biological mother tells emotional story of Spurs star's childhood |first=Aaron |last=Flanagan |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, Alli elected to stop wearing his surname on his match shirts because he felt no connection with the Alli family name, instead opting for "Dele".&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

Alli was a Liverpool fan growing up with [[Steven Gerrard]] his childhood idol,&lt;ref name="BBC Sport 19Sep2014"/&gt; and saw Gerrard and [[Frank Lampard]] as good role models on how they act as professionals.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; He is also a fan of [[British hip hop]] music, which led rapper [[Cadet (rapper)|Cadet]] to release a single referencing the footballer, "[[Advice (song)|Advice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/54381/cadet-and-deno-driz/|title="Advice" by Cadet - 2018|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
