'''Adrian Joseph Mariappa''' (born 3 October 1986) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

He progressed through Watford's youth academy, and started playing for the first team in the [[2005–06 Watford F.C. season|2005–06 season]]. Although primarily a centre back, he spent some of his early professional career at right back due to competition for places in the middle. In his first spell at Watford, he made 247 first team appearances, including 19 in the [[Premier League]]. This included a run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth longest streak in Watford's history. Mariappa captained Watford at under-18, reserve and first-team levels, and was the club's vice captain in his final few years at [[Vicarage Road]]. Mariappa accepted his first call up to [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica's international team]] in May 2012.&lt;ref name=jamaica/&gt; He won his first cap against [[Guyana national football team|Guyana]] later that month, and transferred to [[Premier League]] side [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in July 2012. He made 29 league appearances for the club before joining Premier League side Crystal Palace in September 2013, following Reading's relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship.]]  Returning to Watford before the 2016–17 season, Mariappa made 7 league appearances that season.
