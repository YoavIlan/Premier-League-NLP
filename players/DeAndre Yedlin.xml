Yedlin began playing soccer at age four and learned while watching his uncle from the sideline. Seattle Sounders youth director [[Darren Sawatzky]] first saw him play at age 11 and later said that Yedlin was "an offensive player at the time, he was tricky, he had explosiveness and could run for days." Said [[Seattle Sounders FC|Sounders FC]] sporting director Chris Henderson of Yedlin: "DeAndre has great quickness and speed. He reads the game well, keeps possession, but he's able to attack the flank and get crosses in."&lt;ref name="U23-interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundersu23.com/home/636607.html |title=Getting to Know the U-23's – DeAndre Yedlin |publisher=Seattle Sounders FC U-23 |year=2012 |accessdate=June 4, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306052125/http://www.soundersu23.com/home/636607.html|archivedate=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
