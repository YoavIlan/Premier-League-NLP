'''Vincent Jean Mpoy Kompany''' ({{IPA-fr|vɛ̃sɑ̃ kɔ̃pani}}; {{IPA-nl|vɪnsɛnt kɔmpani}}; born 10 April 1986) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as playing for the [[Belgium national football team]]. In the [[2011–12 Manchester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]] he was awarded the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]] of Manchester City, leading his club to win the [[Premier League]] that season, their first league title in 44 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester City 3–2 QPR | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973148 | date = 13 May 2012 |accessdate = 13 May 2012 | publisher = BBC Sport | first = Phil | last = McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman of Belgium D3B Division club [[BX Brussels]].

Kompany began his professional career at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], spending three years at the Belgian club before moving to [[Bundesliga]] club [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in 2006. In the summer of 2008, at the age of 22, he completed a transfer to his current club, [[Premier League]] side Manchester City. He has since established himself as an integral part of the Manchester City squad and is one of the bargain buys of the revolutionised City era,&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Exclusive – Lee: 'Kompany best centre-back to ever play for Man City' |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/sports-news/football/premier-league/7409/7/exclusive-lee-kompany-best-centre-back-ever-play-man-city |publisher=Talksport |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="royle"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Royle: 'Kompany has been Manchester City's best buy' |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/radio/sports-breakfast/blog/2011-04-26/royle-kompany-has-been-manchester-citys-best-buy |publisher=Talksport |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; blossoming into one of the [[Premier League|Premier League's]] best centre-backs. Kompany was included in the [[PFA Team of the Year|Premier League Team of the Year]] for two years in a row in 2011 and 2012 as well as being included in the 2014 team, and won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]] in 2012.

==Club career==
===Anderlecht===
Born in [[Uccle]], [[Brussels]], Kompany started his career at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] at the age of 17, winning several awards including the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] and the [[Belgian Ebony Shoe]]. Although several top European sides immediately showed interest, the player and his entourage decided to first develop a few more years at Anderlecht. "Don't you worry, I will stay here," he told Berend Scholten at UEFA.com. "At the moment the zeros in my contract are not so important. If I wanted to leave, I would have been gone already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Berend|last=Scholten|title=Anderlecht hold on to Kompany|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=123837.html|publisher=Berend Scholten at UEFA.com|accessdate=4 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamburg===
[[File:Kompany.jpg|thumb|left|Kompany with [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]]]]

On 9 June 2006, however, it was announced that Kompany had been acquired by [[Hamburger SV]] for a fee of €10 million, as a replacement for fellow Belgian [[Daniel Van Buyten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11896/2379826/hamburg-seal-kompany-switch|title=Hamburg Seal Kompany switch|first=James|last=Pearson|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his debut season for Hamburg, he managed only six [[Bundesliga]] starts for the club before suffering an [[Achilles tendon|achilles]] injury in November that ruled him out for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesliga stats|url=http://football.stats.com/bund/players.asp?player=41566|publisher=Footballstats|accessdate=18 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225022/http://football.stats.com/bund/players.asp?player=41566|archive-date=27 September 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of involvement in the season, he was selected in a 30-man provisional squad for the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Berend|last=Scholten|title=Belgium hope for better Kompany|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=1/newsid=537673.html|publisher=UEFA|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=18 May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516114929/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/news/kind=1/newsid=537673.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester City===
====2008–11====

On 28 December 2008, he started the game with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] as a holding midfielder and also completed the full 90 minutes in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wigan 2–1 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7626945.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2010 |first=Mark |last=Ashenden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2009, Kompany signed a new five-year deal with City that would keep him at the club until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8314065.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Kompany signs new Man City deal | date=19 October 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second league goal for the club in a 2–0 home win against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Match: Manchester City v Portsmouth |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=269831&amp;cc=5901 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his third in a 6–1 away win against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Kompany was handed the number 4 jersey for the [[2010–11 Manchester City F.C. season|2010–11 season]] after previous wearer [[Nedum Onuoha]] moved on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].

[[File:2011 FA Cup Final Victory Parade (4).jpg|thumb|right|Kompany holding the [[FA Cup]] during [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]'s 2011 victory parade]]

On 25 April, he again continued to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the side in the absence of striker [[Carlos Tevez]] against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, playing the full 90 minutes alongside Lescott in an important 1–0 victory courtesy of a late 75th-minute strike from [[Edin Džeko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mancini sees Kompany potential |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6944237,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, Kompany captained Manchester City's victory over main rivals Manchester United in the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[FA Cup semi-finals|semi-final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]]; City won the game 1–0. Later that day, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammate Tevez.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the [[2011 FA Cup Final]] he started and finished the match, a 1–0 victory over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which delivered Manchester City's first major trophy for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Duncan |last=White |title=FA Cup final: Manchester City 1 Stoke City 0 match report |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/8514022/FA-Cup-final-Manchester-City-1-Stoke-City-0-match-report.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2010–11 season, in which City qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time, manager [[Roberto Mancini]] praised Kompany's "incredible" season and claimed that with his attitude and mentality, Kompany can become one of the best defenders in [[UEFA|Europe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

He finished the season winning the club's 'Supporter's Player of the Year' and 'Player's Player of the Year' awards, and the [[Premier League Player of the Season]] for his outstanding performances throughout the campaign, clocking up 50 appearances in all competitions including 37 Premier League starts.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====2011–14====
[[File:Manchester City v Real Madrid 21 November 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Kompany (centre) [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing City against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2012]]

Kompany was firmly installed as club captain for the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]], with Tevez having expressed publicly his desire to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/english-football/2011/09/10/2658981/roberto-mancini-confirms-vincent-kompany-will-permanently|title=Roberto Mancini confirms Vincent Kompany will permanently take over Manchester City captaincy from Carlos Tevez|website=Goal|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening fixture on 7 August 2011 was the [[2011 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]], which ended in a 3–2 defeat to rivals Manchester United despite City holding a two-goal lead at half-time.&lt;ref name="BBC-Bevan"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Man City 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14420151.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2012, Kompany scored a header from a [[David Silva]] corner in the Manchester derby; the game finished 1–0 to City and put them in first place ahead of Manchester United on goal difference with only two games of the season remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17810224 | title = Man City 1–0 Man Utd | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 30 April 2012 | accessdate = 15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, the final day of the Premier League season, Kompany led the team against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] which ended in a dramatic 3–2 win, securing the league title for the club for the first time since 1968. QPR midfielder [[Joey Barton]] attempted to headbutt Kompany during the match. On 25 July, Kompany signed a six-year contract with Manchester City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2179124/Vincent-Kompany-signs-year-deal-Manchester-City.html | title = Six more years!

After winning the curtain-raising [[2012 FA Community Shield]] 3–2 against Chelsea (Kompany lifting the trophy at the unfamiliar venue of [[Villa Park]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea 2 Man City 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19133978 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2012–13 in English football|2012–13]] season was something of a disappointment for the club as they finished bottom of their [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|Champions League group]], placed second in the league (but far behind winners Manchester United) and lost the [[2013 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] 1–0 to Wigan Athletic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Ben Watson heads Wigan to FA Cup final glory against Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=11 May 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kompany played in that final, but had missed part of the league campaign due to injury, with Mancini citing his absence as a major factor in the failure to retain the title.&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/9933793/Manchester-City-manager-Roberto-Mancini-admits-mistake-of-not-replacing-Vincent-Kompany-cost-the-title.html|title=Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini admits 'mistake' of not replacing Vincent Kompany cost the title|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2014 Kompany captained the Manchester City team that won the [[2014 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]], beating Sunderland 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26311649|title=Manchester City 3–1 Sunderland|publisher=BBC|website=BBC Sport|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May, he scored Manchester City's second goal in a 2–0 win against West Ham United as the club won the [[2013–14 Premier League]] [[List of English football champions|title]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27273582|title=Man City 2–0 West Ham|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[2014–15 Manchester City F.C. season|2014–15]], Kompany accumulated 33 appearances in all competitions, but the club could only finish runners-up in the league and were eliminated from the domestic and continental cups at early stages, also losing out in the [[2014 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]].&lt;ref name="guardr"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arsenal win Community Shield with victory over Manchester City – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/aug/10/arsenal-manchester-city-community-shield-live-wembley-mbm |first=Michael |last=Butler |work=theguardian.com |date=10 August 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, he suffered a muscular injury during the Manchester derby which ended his campaign early,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/17/vincent-kompany-miss-manchester-city-season-injury|title=Vincent Kompany could miss rest of Manchester City’s season|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this would prove to be the start of a long spell of recurring injuries (mainly muscular [[Strain (injury)|strains]]) for a player who had already endured a number of physical problems since his arrival in England.&lt;ref name=sidelines/&gt;&lt;ref name=mistake/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1360519/Roberto-Mancini-fears-Vincent-Kompany-joined-long-city-injury-list.html|title=Roberto Mancini fears Vincent Kompany has joined the long city injury list|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=25 February 2011|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kompany appeared just 15 times during the campaign, although his continued importance to the team was evidenced by the fact he would always return to the starting line-up as soon as he was fit.

==International career==
[[File:Vincent Kompany - Belgium.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kompany playing for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], 2011]]

Kompany made his international debut aged just 17 for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in February 2004 against [[France national football team|France]], as one of the youngest players ever.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] called up Kompany to the [[2008 Beijing Olympics|2008 Olympics]]. Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1–0 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.

In November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&amp;nbsp;pm that evening. As it happened, he did not return until nearly midnight. Furious, Advocaat removed him from the squad altogether, although on 24 February 2010 he was recalled to the Belgium squad by Advocaat for the friendly against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romelu Lukaku est officiellement Diable Rouge |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/diables-rouges/article/301782/romelu-lukaku-est-officiellement-diable-rouge.html |language=French |newspaper=La Dernière Heure |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocaat resigned his post on 15 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/7594670/Dick-Advocaat-resigns-as-Belgium-coach.html|title=Dick Advocaat resigns as Belgium coach|date=15 April 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 February 2018 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2010, Kompany scored a 90th-minute goal to give Belgium a 2–1 win over [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a friendly. On 10 November 2011, a day before the friendly against [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Georges Leekens]] named Kompany as Belgium captain, succeeding [[Thomas Vermaelen]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

After 34 minutes of Belgium's 2–1 [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] win against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in June 2013, Kompany suffered concussion and facial injuries, including a broken nose and cracked eye-socket, in a collision with goalkeeper [[Vladimir Stojković]]. After receiving first aid on the touchline, he played out the remainder of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kompany-decision-stuns-doctor-4291328 |title=Kompany decision stuns doctor |first=Stuart |last=Brennan |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2014, Kompany was named in the Belgium squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He captained the Red Devils in their first World Cup match in 12 years, a 2–1 win against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Belo Horizonte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Belgium 2–1 Algeria|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries sustained during the season caused him to miss the [[UEFA Euro 2016]].&lt;ref name=euro16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/european-championship/story/2866977/belgium-and-man-city-captain-vincent-kompany-ruled-out-of-euro-2016 |website=[[ESPN FC]] |title=Belgium and Man City captain Vincent Kompany ruled out of Euro 2016 |date= 7 May 2016 |accessdate = 22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, Kompany featured in five of his nation's seven matches, playing every minute in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout phase]] as they advanced to the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions
[[France national football team|France]], overcoming [[England national football team|England]] to finish third, their highest ever placing in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44748604|title=Belgium 2–0 England|date=14 July 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Kompany has been described as one of the best defenders in world football,&lt;ref name="Vincent Kompany stands alone"/&gt; and is recognised to be a physically strong centreback, with excellent aerial ability, and mobility, as well as good technique and distribution. He is also a very accurate tackler with strong positional sense and excels at anticipating his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/conosciamo-vincent-kompany-il-difensore-che-piace-tanto-ai-viola-46476|title=Conosciamo Vincent Kompany, il difensore che piace tanto ai viola|publisher=Tutto Mercato Web.com|language=Italian|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kompany also has an older sister. Among his friends are former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] goalkeeper [[Yves Ma-Kalambay]] and former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] defender [[Floribert N'Galula]], both of whom he consulted about his move to England before joining Manchester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=John |date=January 2006 |title=Q&amp;A: Vincent Kompany |journal=[[FourFourTwo]] |issue=137 |page=150 |location=Teddington |publisher=Haymarket Consumer |editor1-first=Hugh |editor1-last=Sleight |issn=1355-0276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kompany has a number of pastimes and interests which keep him occupied outside of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vincent Kompany: Manchester derby is world's biggest after El Clásico |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/27/vincent-kompany-manchester-el-clasico |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an interest in politics and graduated with an [[MBA]]  at [[Manchester Business School]] in 2018 after several years of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kompany goes back to school as City skipper studies for business degree |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2088889/Vincent-Kompany-to-university-business-degree.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/vincent-kompany-graduates-degree-alliance-manchester-business-school/ |title=Premier League Club Captain graduates with degree from Alliance Manchester Business School |work=[[University of Manchester]] |date=29 December 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kompany has been characterized as "erudite" and "eloquent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchestercity/article4208800.ece|title=Vincent Kompany talks up Manchester City’s chances|newspaper=The Times|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Kompany opened two new sports bars in Belgium by the name of Good Kompany, one at the Grand Place in [[Brussels]] and the other at the Groenplaats in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Good Kompany: Manchester City captain Vincent opens sports bars in Belgium|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2607812/In-good-Kompany-Manchester-City-captain-open-sports-bars-Belgium.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=18 April 2014 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kompany closed down both bars within a year of their opening. At the time of their closure, Kompany was quoted as saying "I regret this decision. We had enough customers, turnover was good, but not enough to cover the costs. So that's where it ends. Lesson 1 in business: investments are always a risk. You win some, you lose some."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Good Kompany' closes its doors in Antwerp|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/videozone_ENG/1.2248947|newspaper=Flandersnews.be |date=23 February 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
