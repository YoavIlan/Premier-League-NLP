On 22 July 2014, Van Dijk and [[Teemu Pukki]] each scored twice in a 4–0 home win over [[Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur|KR]] in a [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifier, putting their team into the next round 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Burrows |title=Celtic 4–0 KR Reykjavik: Hoops ease into next Champions League round in comfortable fashion |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/celtic-4-0-kr-reykjavik-hoops-3897700 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=22 July 2014 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal of the [[2014–15 Scottish Premiership|Premiership season]] came on 9 November, finishing from [[Stefan Johansen]]'s last-minute corner for a 2–1 win at Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Moffat |title=Aberdeen 1–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868766 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Van Dijk scored the first and last goals of Celtic's 4–0 win versus [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] in the fourth round of the [[Scottish Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Southwick |title=Heart of Midlothian 0–4 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30166217 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after that, his sixth goal of the season was enough for victory in a home match against [[Glasgow]] neighbours [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Celtic 1–0 Partick Thistle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28647040 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Dijk was again on target on 21 January 2015, opening a 4–0 home win over [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Moffat |title=Celtic 4–0 Motherwell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30808448 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 January 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February, he was sent off in the 36th minute against [[Inter Milan]] for a foul on [[Mauro Icardi]], as Celtic lost 1–0 on the night, 4–3 on aggregate in the last 32 of the [[UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Swan |title=Inter 1 Celtic 0 (4–3 agg): Late strike finishes off battling ten-man Celtic and ends their Europa League run |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-match-reports/inter-1-celtic-0-4-3-5239236 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=26 February 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again sent off on 8 March in the Cup quarter-final away to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Tannadice Park]], receiving a red card after eleven minutes for a confrontation with [[Calum Butcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keir |last=Murray |title=Dundee United 1–1 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31680308 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suspension for the following week's [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final|Scottish League Cup Final]] was overturned on appeal, as was that of [[Paul Paton]], who was sent off when mistaken for Butcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Dijk and Paton cleared to play in League Cup final |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31858622 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Dijk played the full 90 minutes of the final at [[Hampden Park]], which Celtic won 2–0.&lt;ref name=2015SLC&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Wilson |title=Dundee United 0–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31785677 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March, Celtic's third consecutive match against Dundee United, Van Dijk scored in the last minute to confirm a 4–0 win in a Cup replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtic 4–0 Dundee United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31826157 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April, Celtic contested the Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden, and Van Dijk opened the scoring with a free kick. After the dismissal of goalkeeper [[Craig Gordon]], Celtic fell 3–2, ending their chance of a [[Treble (association football)|treble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |title=Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3–2 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089585 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, again from a free kick, he confirmed a 2–1 win away to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Southwick |title=Celtic 1–2 Dundee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31827990 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team again won the league, and Van Dijk was included in the league's Team of the Season for the second consecutive campaign.&lt;ref name=1415PFA&gt;{{cite news |first=Gregor |last=Kyle |title=The SPFL dream team: PFA Scotland announce their teams of the year |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spfl-dream-team-pfa-scotland-5616035 |newspaper=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Dijk was reportedly "considering his future" in Glasgow after Celtic were knocked out of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]] in the qualifying rounds to [[Malmö FF|Malmö]] of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virgil van Dijk: Celtic defender considers future after defeat |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34060123 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Van Dijk made his full international debut for [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 10 October 2015, in a 2–1 victory away from home against [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Successful Saturday for Saints stars |url=https://southamptonfc.com/news/2015-10-10/successful-saturday-for-saints-stars |publisher=Southampton F.C. |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[captain (association football)|captain]]cy of his country by manager [[Ronald Koeman]] on 22 March 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Van Dijk named new Netherlands captain |first=Daniel |last=Karell |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=22 March 2018 |work=soccer.nbcsports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |url=http://soccer.nbcsports.com/2018/03/22/van-dijk-named-new-netherlands-captain/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first match as captain was a 1–0 home friendly defeat by [[England national football team|England]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Netherlands 0–1 England |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=23 March 2018 |accessdate=24 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43380175}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March, he scored his first international goal to conclude a 3–0 win over European champions [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] at the [[Stade de Genève]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soccer – Portugal suffer first-half collapse in 3–0 loss to Dutch |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-friendly-por-ned/soccer-portugal-suffer-first-half-collapse-in-3-0-loss-to-dutch-idUKKBN1H22S7 |accessdate=26 March 2018 |agency=Reuters |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, he scored in a 3–0 win over [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45851123 |title=Netherlands 3–0 Germany: Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum score for hosts |date=13 October 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Van Dijk is a right-footed [[centre back]], who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although he can also play as a right-sided centre back.&lt;ref name=NMcG&gt;{{cite news |title=Virgil van Dijk 'can be a great' as Liverpool agree to pay £75m for defender |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40730793 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 December 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called him "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the ideal central defender", praising him as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong leadership qualities", while commenting that since his move to England, he is "more tactically aware now [...] his anticipation and timing has improved and he is a lot more of an all-rounder".&lt;ref name=NMcG/&gt; McGuinness believes Van Dijk's "biggest problem" is that he "can switch off when the game is comfortable".&lt;ref name=NMcG/&gt;
