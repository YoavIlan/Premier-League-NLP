'''Erik Manuel Lamela''' ({{IPA-es|ˈeɾik laˈmela}}; born 4 March 1992) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for English {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

He began his career at [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and in 2011 transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] for an initial €12 million. After two [[Serie A]] seasons he joined Tottenham for a fee of £25.8 million. A full international since 2011, he was part of the Argentine squad which finished as runners-up at the [[2015 Copa América]].

==Early life==
After he had joined River Plate as a seven-year old, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] reportedly offered Lamela and his family £100,000 a year, as well as a house and employment for his parents, to move to the city of [[Barcelona]], in a similar deal to the one that saw [[Lionel Messi]] move to Spain as a youngster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/425727/WATCH-Tottenham-s-Erik-Lamela-spurned-Barcelona-as-a-child |title=Tottenham's Erik Lamela spurned Barcelona as a child |work=Express |publisher=Express |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a ''[[Trans World Sport]]'' film crew travelled to Argentina to interview a 12-year-old Lamela who was already making headlines after scoring 120 goals for River Plate's youth side the previous season. In the video, Lamela declares his wish to follow in the footsteps of [[Diego Maradona]] and win a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ric0xTz5g2A |title=12-year-old Erik Lamela on Trans World Sport |work=YouTube |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===River Plate===
Lamela made his first team debut for [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] on 14 June 2009 in a game against [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] for the [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Clausura|2009 Clausura tournament]]. He entered the field on the 80th minute, substituting [[Robert Mario Flores|Robert Flores]]. Lamela scored his first goal for River on 5 December 2010 in a match against [[Club Atlético Colón|Colón]] for the [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Apertura|Apertura tournament]]. He scored his second goal against [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] in the final fixture of that Apertura, helping River win the match 4–2.

The midfielder was a regular starter for River during the [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season]], playing 34 games and scoring four goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinesoccer.com/player.cfm?id=lmla |title=Profile |publisher=Argentine Soccer |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped his team to finish in an overall sixth place that would have qualified them for the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana]]. Due to the relegation format of the Argentine Primera that accounts a team's last three seasons, however, River was relegated after losing a playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]].

===Roma===
====2011–12 season====
[[File:Oscar Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.JPG|thumb|right|Lamela (r.) playing for Roma against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in August 2013]]

On 6 August 2011, Lamela joined Italian club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] of [[Serie A]] for a fee of €12 million, plus €2 million in bonuses, which was activated after his 20th club appearance.&lt;ref name=Romacontract&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/operazioni_di_mercato/2011-08-06_acquisizione_a_titolo_definitivo_dei_diritti_alle_prestazioni_sportive_del_calciatore_erik_manuel_lamela.pdf |title=Acquisizione a titolo definitivo dei diritti alle prestazioni sportive del calciatore Erik Manuel Lamela |publisher=asroma.it |accessdate=6 August 2011 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma also paid an additional €3.2 million to Orel B.V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/comunicati_finanziari/2012_31_10_as_relazione_finanziaria_annuale_al_30_giugno_2012.pdf |title=Relazione Finanziaria annuale al 30 giugno 2012 |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2013 |publisher=AS Roma |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; — plus 10% added value if the player was later sold above €12 million — and €3.06 million in the form of taxes to the Government of Argentina. Lamela signed a 5-year contract worth €1.8 million in gross in the first season, but would gradually increase by €350,000 on 1 July 2012 (to €2.15M), 2014 (€2.5M) and 2015 (€2.85M).&lt;ref name=Romacontract/&gt; On 23 October 2011, he scored his first goal in Serie A against [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/327134/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828112219/http://espnfc.com/en/report/327134/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=AS Roma 1–0 Palermo |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he scored goals against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/326903/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828113445/http://espnfc.com/en/report/326903/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=Lecce 4–2 AS Roma |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novara Calcio|Novara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/en/report/326912/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828113418/http://espnfc.com/en/report/326912/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=3436 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 August 2013 |title=Europe close in on AS Roma |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A.C.

====2012–13 season====
Lamela began the [[2012–13 Serie A|2012–13 season]] well, his first goal of the season coming against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 16 September 2012. Lamela hit a superb patch of form in October and early November, scoring seven goals in six games, including a brace against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in a 3–2 home defeat and goals against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], and [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]. He also scored a goal in the [[Derby della Capitale]] against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. After almost a month out with an ankle ligament injury, he returned to the field and scored a brace against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in a 4–2 victory on 22 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/88222/roma-vs-ac-milan/report? |title=Roma 4–2 AC Milan: Ragged Rossoneri leave it too late against 10-man Giallorossi |publisher=Goal.com |date=22 December 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamela went on to score 15 times in 33 games, putting him joint-fifth in Serie A and second to striker [[Dani Osvaldo|Pablo Osvaldo]] (16 goals) at Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/stats/scorers?league=ita.1&amp;year=2012 |title=Italian Serie A Goal Scoring Leaders – 2012–13 |work=ESPN |publisher=Entertainment and Sports Programming Network |accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamela's and Roma's season, however, ended in heartache with defeat to [[Rome]] rivals Lazio in the [[2012–13 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] final, coupled with finishing sixth in Serie A, meaning that Roma would not play [[UEFA|European]] football for the second consecutive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/106534/roma-vs-lazio/report? |title=Roma 0–1 Lazio: Biancocelesti edge dour derby to claim Coppa Italia |publisher=Goal.com |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 30 August 2013, [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] completed the transfer of Lamela from Roma for a deal worth an initial £25.8&amp;nbsp;million, plus up to £4.2&amp;nbsp;million in bonus payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/373444642198405121 |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur Twitter |accessdate=30 August 2013 |title=We are delighted to announce that we've reached agreement with AS Roma for the transfer of Erik Lamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23903926 |title=Erik Lamela: Tottenham confirm the signing of Roma forward |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee for Lamela made him the most expensive player in the club's history, breaking the two previous records that had been set earlier in the transfer window, first for [[Paulinho (footballer)|Paulinho]] and then [[Roberto Soldado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2404513/Tottenham-seal-30m-Erik-Lamela-AS-Roma.html |title=Tottenham seal £30m Lamela deal to complete hat-trick of club record transfers |publisher=Daily Mail |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
On 1 September, Lamela made his debut for Tottenham as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1–0 [[North London derby]] loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23831033 |title=Arsenal 1–0 Tottenham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |first=Alistair |last=Magowan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, he made his first start for Tottenham against [[Tromsø IL]] in the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], assisting [[Jermain Defoe]] for Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at [[White Hart Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/10321158/Tottenham-Hotspur-3-Tromso-0-match-report.html |title=Tottenham Hotspur 3 Tromso 0: match report |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, he assisted Paulinho's stoppage-time winning goal after appearing as a substitute in Tottenham's 1–0 win at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24098608 |title=Cardiff 0–1 Tottenham |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October, with Lamela having yet to start a Premier League match, Tottenham manager [[André Villas-Boas]] said of the player, "He knows he isn't producing half of what he can produce, but he understands the situation now is that he has to compete for his place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1598356/tottenham-boss-andre-villas-boas-admits-erik-lamela-form-struggles?cc=3436 |title=Villas-Boas admits Lamela struggles |date=29 November 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November, Lamela scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 Europa League win against [[FC Sheriff Tiraspol|Sheriff Tiraspol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/07/tottenham-hotspur-sheriff-europa-league |title=Tottenham's Jermain Defoe breaks club scoring record in win over Sheriff |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen days later, he made his first start in the Premier League as Tottenham were beaten 6–0 by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24976958 |title=Man City 6–0 Tottenham Hotspur |date=24 November 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His season was ended by a back injury in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27070007 |title=Erik Lamela: Injured Tottenham midfielder to miss end of season |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
