'''Olivier Jonathan Giroud''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔlivje ʒiʁu}}; born 30 September 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

He began his career at [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] in [[Ligue 2]] before joining [[Tours FC|Tours]] in 2008. In his [[2009–10 Ligue 2|second season]] at Tours, he was the division's top scorer with 21 goals, earning him a move to top-flight side [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]]. Giroud was again the top scorer with 21 goals in the [[2011–12 Ligue 1|2011–12 season]], giving the club their first ever [[Ligue 1]] title before moving to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Giroud won the [[FA Cup]] with Arsenal in [[2014 FA Cup Final|2014]], [[2015 FA Cup Final|2015]] and [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]], and totalled 105 goals in 253 games for the club. In January 2018, he transferred to Chelsea on an 18-month contract.

Giroud made his full international debut for France in 2011. He has earned over 80 caps, and was part of the teams which reached the quarter-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] in which he received the [[UEFA Euro 2016#Awards|Bronze Boot]] as joint second-highest goalscorer, and won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early career==
Giroud was born in [[Chambéry]], France in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]], and was raised in the nearby village of [[Froges]], close to [[Grenoble]].&lt;ref name="giroud_career"&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview Olivier Giroud avant RC Strasbourg – Tours FC |url=http://toursfc.over-blog.com/article-interview-olivier-giroud-avant-rc-strasbourg-tours-fc-38281708.html|work=[[Tours FC]] | date= 27 October 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroud is of Italian descent through both of his grandmothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rfgenealogie.com/s-informer/infos/celebrites/aux-origines-de-payet-giroud-et-griezmann|title=Aux origines de Payet, Giroud et Griezmann|first=eZ|last=Systems|website=La revue française de Généalogie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofoot.com/giroud-la-marseillaise-et-sa-mamie-223738.html|title=Giroud, la Marseillaise et sa mamie|website=''SOFOOT.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroud began his football career playing for his hometown club, Olympique Club de Froges. He spent six years training at the club before joining professional club [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="giroud_career"/&gt;

==Club career==
===Grenoble===
Giroud spent five years developing in Grenoble's youth academy before signing his first professional contract at the age of 21. He later admitted that signing his first contract was an important part in his development as a player, stating "It took me signing my first professional contract to become aware of my abilities. If you [a club] trusted me, it was because I must have had some qualities."&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"&gt;{{cite news |title=Olivier Giroud, buteur né |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2011/10/30/ligue-1-olivier-giroud-buteur-ne_1595293_3242.html|work=Le Monde | date= 30 October 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the [[2005–06 Ligue 2|2005–06 season]], he was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the [[Championnat de France amateur 2]], the fifth level of [[Football in France|French football]]. Giroud quickly became an important player in the team scoring 15 goals in 15 matches.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; His performances over seven months with the reserve team resulted in the player being called up to the senior team in March 2006 by manager [[Thierry Goudet]]. Giroud made his professional debut on 27 March appearing as a late-match substitute in a 1–1 draw with [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] in [[Ligue 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gueugnon v. Grenoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/50374|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a part of the senior team for the rest of the campaign making five more substitute appearances.

Giroud was promoted to the senior team permanently for the [[2006–07 Ligue 2|2006–07]] season by new manager Payton Pouliquen and Nicola Malgeri and was assigned the number 22 shirt. After appearing as a substitute in the team's first league match of the campaign, he made his first professional start in a 2–1 defeat away to [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]] playing the entire match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Niort v. Grneoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/50922|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2007, Giroud scored his first professional goal netting the [[injury time]] winner against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grenoble v. Le Havre Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/51254|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the goal as "a fantastic memory. I could not dream better for a first pro goal". A month later, Giroud made his third start of the campaign against Gueugnon. In the match, which ended 0–0, Giroud incurred his first professional [[Penalty card|red card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gueugnon v. Grenoble Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/51172|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the campaign with 18 total appearances and two goals as Grenoble finished in fifth place.

====Loan to Istres====
In an attempt to earn some playing time, Giroud spent the [[2007–08 Championnat National|2007–08 season]] on loan at [[FC Istres|Istres]] in the [[Championnat National]], the third level of football in France.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Under the tutelage of manager [[Frédéric Arpinon]], he continued his development as a striker and, in his second match with the club, scored his first goal in a 2–1 win over [[Stade Lavallois|Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laval v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-laval-istres-8958.html|work=Foot-National | date=11 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Giroud scored goals in back-to-back matches against [[Vannes OC|Vannes]] and [[US Créteil-Lusitanos|Créteil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Istres v. VannesMatch Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-istres-vannes-9052.html|work=Foot-National | date=25 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Créteil v.

Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-arles-avignon-istres-9292.html|work=Foot-National | date=22 September 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fortnight later, Giroud converted two goals again, this time in a 3–2 win over [[Pau FC|Pau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pau v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-pau-istres-8978.html|work=Foot-National | date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After going through the months of November and December without scoring a league goal, Giroud returned to form in January scoring goals in a 3–2 defeat to Vannes and a 2–0 win over [[AS Beauvais Oise|Beauvais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vannes v. Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-vannes-istres-9053.html|work=Foot-National | date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beauvais v.

Istres Match Report |url=http://www.foot-national.com/match-foot-paris-fc-istres-9151.html|work=Foot-National | date=5 April 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Martigues v.

After a successful loan stint, Giroud returned to Grenoble with hopes of receiving some significant playing time as the club was now playing in [[Ligue 1]]. However, club manager [[Mehmed Baždarević]], who was hired while Giroud was on his loan stint at Istres, deemed the player surplus to requirements and, subsequently, listed him for transfer. According to reports, Baždarević had declared that Giroud "did not have the level to play among the elite".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; In 2011, Giroud reevaluated his departure from Grenoble stating "I am neither resentful nor vengeful. I am just disappointed with what happened to Grenoble when there was great potential".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt;

===Tours===
[[File:Olivier giroud.jpg|thumb|upright|Giroud playing for Tours in 2010]]
On 28 May 2008, it was reported that Giroud had agreed to a three-year deal with Ligue 2 club [[Tours FC|Tours]]. The striker was lured to the club by sporting director Max Marty who had previously served as the chief executive officer of Grenoble, Giroud's former club.&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Giroud was also fond of Tours' manager [[Daniel Sanchez (French footballer)|Daniel Sanchez]] stating "It's always a plus to have a former striker as a coach. His advice to me really helped a lot. With him, I progressed in my positioning and also in front of goal".&lt;ref name="giroud_lemonde"/&gt; Giroud was given the number 12 shirt and, due to injury, made his club debut on 3 September 2008 in a 2–1 defeat to [[US Boulogne|Boulogne]] in the [[2008–09 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Boulogne Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/52984|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut a week later playing the entire match in a 1–0 win over [[Nîmes Olympique|Nîmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nîmes v. Tours Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52658|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Giroud scored his first goal for the club converting the opener in a league match against [[RC Lens|Lens]]. In the second half, he scored another goal to cap a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Lens Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52697|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Giroud scored his third goal for the club in a victory over [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v.

In the [[2008–09 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], Giroud scored five goals in two matches. In the eighth round of the competition, he scored the team's only goal in a 1–0 win over semi-professional club [[Pacy Vallée-d'Eure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pacy v. Tours Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/53033|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=13 December 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing round against [[Réunion]]ais club [[SS Jeanne d'Arc|Jeanne d'Arc]], Giroud scored four goals in a 7–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jeanne d'Arc v.

Tours Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52602|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v.

After making two substitute appearances on his return, in his first start since the injury on 3 April against [[Angers SCO|Angers]], Giroud scored the team's opening goal in a 3–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Angers Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52869|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giroud later re-aggravated the previous injury in training, which led to him missing the entire month of April as Tours were contesting a promotion battle with several clubs. Despite losing Giroud, the club went unbeaten in the four league matches he missed. On his return against Boulogne on 8 May, Giroud scored his final goal of the season in a victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v. Boulogne Match Report |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/52963|work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2012 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tours' final three league matches of the campaign, the club failed to achieve a win, which resulted in the club failing to earn promotion to [[Ligue 1]]. Giroud finished the season with 27 total appearances and 14 goals.

In the [[2009–10 in French football|2009–10 season]], Giroud was promoted to the lead striker role following the departure of [[Tenema N'Diaye]] to [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. The promotion immediately paid off as Giroud scored two goals in the team's opening match of the season; a 2–1 win over [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] in the [[2009–10 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tours v.
