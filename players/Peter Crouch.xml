'''Peter James Crouch'''  (born 30 January 1981) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|Burnley}} club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He was capped 42 times by the [[England national football team|England national team]] between 2005 and 2010, scoring 22 goals for his country in that time, and appearing at two World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/aug/01/peter-crouch-tottenham-expensive-english-striker|title=Are we addicted to Peter Crouch? |first=Barnay |last=Ronay |date=1 August 2009|accessdate=1 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch is one of 28 [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals]], holding the record for the most headed goals in [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41553916 |title=Peter Crouch: Stoke striker holds Premier League record for most headers |date=9 October 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crouch began his career as a trainee with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] and Swedish club [[IFK Hässleholm]] he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] acquired him on a transfer deal worth £1.5&amp;nbsp;million. He had a strong first season at [[Fratton Park]], and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in March 2002 for £5&amp;nbsp;million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2003 before making a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield]] in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]].

After scoring 42 goals in three seasons at [[Anfield]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] re-acquired Crouch for £11&amp;nbsp;million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international [[Jermain Defoe]]. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and [[Harry Redknapp]]. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] which earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010–11, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2011, for a club record fee of £10&amp;nbsp;million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's [[Stoke City F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] award. He scored eight in [[2012–13 Stoke City F.C. season|2012–13]] and then hit ten in both the [[2013–14 Stoke City F.C. season|2013–14]] and [[2014–15 Stoke City F.C. season|2014–15 seasons]]. Crouch spent seven-and-a-half years with Stoke, scoring 62 goals before joining Burnley in January 2019.

==Early life==
Crouch was born in [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; but his family moved to Singapore when he was one year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Sam|title=Peter Crouch: The tall guy (and his dad) |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/peter-crouch-the-tall-guy-and-his-dad-396148.html |accessdate=4 August 2015 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 October 2007 |quote=Bruce and Jayne were 21 when Peter was born and within two years the young family moved to Singapore for Bruce's work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family's move to Singapore came about when his father Bruce, originally from [[Fulham]], took up a job offer to work at a Singaporean advertising agency.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; The Crouch family spent three years living in the Far East, and moved back to England after Bruce rejected the chance to work in Australia.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; They then spent time living at a [[YMCA]] in [[Tottenham]] before settling in [[Harrow on the Hill]]. Crouch attended Roxeth Primary and [[North Ealing Primary School|North Ealing Primary]] and began to play football with Northolt Hotspurs. He was then invited to join the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] Centre of Excellence in 1991 and he also played for the boys club West Middlesex Colts whilst attending [[Drayton Manor High School]].&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; Crouch turned down contract offers from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and instead joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the summer of 1994.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt; He did not stay at QPR for long, however, for in November 1994, the coaching staff at [[Loftus Road]] moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], including its youth team manager [[Des Bulpin]], who offered Crouch a contract at Spurs.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"/&gt;

Crouch's family were Chelsea supporters and he became a [[ball boy]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] at the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17173591&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=62484&amp;headline=my-pete-s-no-freak-name_page.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212001904/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D17173591%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D62484%26headline%3Dmy-pete-s-no-freak-name_page.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |location=London |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=My Pete's No Freak |date=4 June 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he attended some Chelsea matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6541005.stm|title=Benitez expects test from Chelsea|publisher=BBC |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he told the Liverpool official website that despite this, he and his friends at the time were fans of QPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155602070413-1422.htm|title=Crouch: I Love it at Liverpool |first=Steve |last=Hunter |publisher=Liverpool F.C.|date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415045541/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155602070413-1422.htm |archivedate = 15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
Crouch signed a professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur on 2 July 1998, after having played for their youth team.&lt;ref name="England website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersC/BioCrouchP.html |title=Peter Crouch |work=England Football Online |publisher=Glen Isherwood &amp; Peter Young |date=24 May 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not make any appearances for their first team and was loaned out to other clubs, having brief spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division and, in the summer of 2000, [[IFK Hässleholm]] in Sweden, where he played in the local fourth-highest division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1799614,00.html|title=Mellberg says Crouch is biggest threat|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Michael |last=Walker| date=17 June 2006|accessdate=18 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His move to Sweden came about when IFK Hässleholm sold [[Jon Jönsson]] to Tottenham for £70,000 and also agreed two loan deals for the Swedish club, that of Crouch and [[Alton Thelwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Crouch: Former Tottenham Hotspur and Stoke City man in Sweden |url=http://lesrosbifs.org/peter-crouch-former-tottenham-hotspur-and-stoke-city-man-in-sweden/ |work=Les Rosbifs |accessdate=7 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610070025/http://lesrosbifs.org/peter-crouch-former-tottenham-hotspur-and-stoke-city-man-in-sweden/ |archivedate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QPR and Portsmouth===
On 28 July 2000, Tottenham sold Crouch to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Queens Park Rangers for £60,000.&lt;ref name="England website"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Francis grabs Grieves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/863684.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=2 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an immediate impression with QPR, scoring ten league goals in the [[2000–01 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2000–01 season]], but it was not enough to prevent the team's relegation to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huddersfield 2–1 QPR|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1285987.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] bought Crouch for £1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portsmouth sign £1.5m Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1421884.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=4 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch scored 18 [[2001–02 Football League|league]] goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth during the [[2001–02 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001–02 season]] and was tipped by manager [[Graham Rix]] to have a big future in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch tipped for the top|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1650237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=11 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aston Villa===
In March 2002, [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] made a successful £5&amp;nbsp;million bid for Crouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch seals Villa move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1894063.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=27 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his home debut for Villa, the equalising goal against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and went on to score twice in seven appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newcastle held by Villa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1901022.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=2 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch, however, failed to hold down a regular place in the Aston Villa team in the following [[2002–03 Aston Villa F.C. season|2002–03 season]] making 18 appearances without scoring.&lt;ref name=sb0203/&gt; Looking for first team football, he was loaned to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] from September to December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canaries sign Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/3080160.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch played 15 times for the Canaries in [[2003–04 Norwich City F.C. season|2003–04]], scoring four goals helping the team gain promotion.&lt;ref name=sb0304/&gt; Crouch was sent off for retaliation during Norwich's 3–1 win at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], but nonetheless his spell at Norwich renewed interest in his abilities from other clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch eyes Canaries stay|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/3253998.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the three-month loan, he returned to Aston Villa, and scored a brace against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], a late winner at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and the opener at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name=sb0304/&gt; Villa sold Crouch in July 2004 to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for a fee of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch joins Saints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/3876589.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
Despite initially being back-up to first choice strikers [[James Beattie (footballer)|James Beattie]] and [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]], Crouch became the main attacking focus of the Southampton team upon the arrival of [[Harry Redknapp]] and the sale of Beattie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beattie to complete £6.5m Everton switch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2353206/Beattie-to-complete-6.5m-Everton-switch.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=30 May 2017|date=3 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored many key goals in Southampton's relegation battle, including memorable goals against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a 2–0 home win, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a 1–1 home draw and two away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middlesbrough 1–3 Southampton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4343227.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and [[South Coast derby|Saints' arch-rival]] Portsmouth out of the [[2004–05 FA Cup|FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 2–1 Portsmouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4197721.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=29 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first [[England national football team|England]] call-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup Scouting – Peter Crouch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/4750849.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the [[2004–05 Southampton F.C. season|2004–05 season]], his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 1–2 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4525113.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7&amp;nbsp;million to Liverpool on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crouch completes Liverpool move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4677639.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liverpool===
[[File:Peter Crouch 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Crouch with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2006]]

Crouch underwent intense media scrutiny because of a goal drought during his first months at Liverpool. For 19 matches—the span of four months—he was unable to score. Crouch was praised for other facets of his game, such as his touch on the ball, but his first goal for the club evaded him. The fact that Crouch possessed "good touch for a big man" became something of a media [[cliché]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,1588933,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Barry|last=Glendenning|title=The Crouch-a-saurus|date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=4 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his Liverpool career, the supporters composed a new chant: "He's big, he's red, his feet stick out the bed, Peter Crouch, Peter Crouch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The long and the short of it|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2042066,00.html|first=Simon|last=Garfield |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=25 March 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drought finally ended on 3 December 2005 when he scored against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Although this first goal was originally given as an [[own goal]], it was later awarded to Crouch on appeal; he went on to score a second goal in the same match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4473084.stm|title=Liverpool 3–0 Wigan |date=3 December 2005 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before these goals, Crouch had played over 24 hours of football for Liverpool without scoring.

Two further goals followed in England's next match, a 5–0 win over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in their opening qualifying match for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] on 2 September 2006. Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Fiver/0,,1864775,00.html|title=Passive boozing; and wild-tackling Scouser |first1=Rob |last1=Smyth |first2=Paul |last2=Doyle |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this had happened several times pre-Second World War, most recently by [[Dixie Dean]] (12 goals in 1927) and [[George Camsell]] (11 goals in 1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGoals/GoalsTopScorersCal.html |title=England's top scorers: Calendar year |work=England Football Online |publisher=Glen Isherwood &amp; Peter Young |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An operation needed for a nose injury he sustained playing for Liverpool prevented him from playing in England's two qualifying matches in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/6550278|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316013932/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/6550278|archivedate=16 March 2007|title=Crouch nose he'll miss a month|publisher=Fox Sports|date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the England squad for their matches against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] in late May and early June 2007, scoring in the qualifying match against the latter.&lt;ref name=Estonia/&gt; Crouch was England's top scorer in the qualifying campaign with five goals, but this did not prevent England finishing only third in their group and failing to progress to the finals of the competition.&lt;ref name=Croatia/&gt;

===Capello era===
[[File:Spain vs England.jpg|thumb|right|Crouch (wearing No.20) playing for England versus [[Spain national football team|Spain]], 2009]]

On 1 April 2009, Crouch made his first start under McClaren's successor, [[Fabio Capello]], in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|2010 World Cup qualifier]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]. He scored England's first goal in their 2–1 victory.&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt; Crouch was re-called to the England squad for the friendly against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 6|World Cup qualifier]] versus [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], following his fine form for Tottenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8229098.stm |title=Capello recalls Crouch and Lennon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch also got an early first half goal against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in the final 2010 World Cup qualifier, which he then followed up with a second goal in the 76th minute.&lt;ref name=Belarus/&gt; This took Crouch's tally for England up to 18 goals in just 17 starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peter Crouch Myth|url=http://www.ongoalsscored.com/2011/08/07/the-peter-crouch-myth/|website=On Goals Scored|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch scored a brace after coming on as a substitute against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in a friendly on 3 March 2010 to take his overall international goal tally to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England in fine fettle thanks to Crouch|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1456964.html|publisher=UEFA|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored the second goal for England against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 24 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 3–1 Mexico|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8699042.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Cup===
Crouch was named in Capello's final 23-man squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and was given the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 2010: England announce squad numbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8720235.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as a substitute for [[Emile Heskey]] in England's opening match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and also came off the bench for [[Gareth Barry]] in the following match against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 1–1 USA|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_05|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England 0–0 Algeria|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_23|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch did not take part in the final group stage match with Slovenia or the 4–1 loss to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs England|last-16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia 0–1 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_37|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 4–1 England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_51|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-2010 World Cup===
Crouch came on as a substitute in the home friendly against France for the injured Steven Gerrard on 17 November 2010. He scored quickly from an [[Ashley Young]] corner to make the score 1–2 with an angled side-footed volley. It was his second touch of the ball.&lt;ref name=France/&gt; After not making an appearance for England for almost a year, Crouch stated in October 2011 that he "does not carry much hope" of receiving a call-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stoke City's Peter Crouch fears for England future|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15275354.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 October 2011|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a run of good form in September 2017, Crouch said in a television interview that he was not officially retired from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafez|first1=Shamoon|title=Premier League stats: Harry Kane, Man Utd, Man City, Arsene Wenger, Roy Hodgson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41456051|accessdate=2 October 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality as a footballer==
===Nicknames===
Although generally known as "Crouchy," other nicknames he has been given by fans and the media in England have included "RoboCrouch"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcup.itv.com/News/Story_Page/0,15843,8607_1277794,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029235019/http://worldcup.itv.com/News/Story_Page/0%2C15843%2C8607_1277794%2C00.html |archivedate=29 October 2006 |title=RoboCrouch out of operation? |publisher=ITV |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Crouchinho" (an ironic use of the "-[[inho]]" suffix, meaning "little" in Portuguese and used by many Brazilian footballers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/columnists/story/0,,1881581,00.html|title=Crouch on the couch |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been also referred to as "[[Mr. Roboto]]" by [[Univision]]'s commentators and as "Pantera Rosa" ("[[The Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]]") by [[Fox Sports en Español]] commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/Nick_Webster/2006/09/03/Pantera_RosaEnglands_not_so_secret_weapon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415175323/http://community.foxsports.com/Nick_Webster/blog/2006/09/03/Pantera_RosaEnglands_not_so_secret_weapon|archivedate=15 April 2012|title='Pantera Rosa'...

===Robotic dancing===
In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing [[goal celebration]].&lt;ref name="Robot"/&gt; A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate [[David Beckham]]'s house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May. He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper wrote that the dance was inspired by the lyrics to the [[Arctic Monkeys]]' hit single "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17164877&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=one-bets-one-looks-good-on-the-dancefloor--name_page.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509143121/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D17164877%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D115875%26headline%3Done-bets-one-looks-good-on-the-dancefloor--name_page.html |archivedate= 9 May 2011 |first1=Martin |last1=Lipton |first2=Paul |last2=Byrne |title=World Cup Willie |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=2 June 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, Crouch announced he would perform his robotic dance again only if England were to win the World Cup, saying, "It's not about robotic dancing. It is about scoring goals and winning matches. It's an important time for everyone now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5072314.stm|title=Crouch halts robotic celebrations|publisher=BBC |date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=13 June 2006|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, he was quoted in ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper as saying that, "It was funny at the time, but I didn't want to carry on doing it until it became unfunny. I've stopped doing it for the time being, but if I ever score a really big goal you never know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1863698,00.html|title=Confident Crouch happy to be plan B |first=Paul |last=Wilson |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=3 September 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2007, Crouch said he would never use the robot dance again unless he scored in the UEFA Champions League Final, but he partially reprised it on 1 April 2009 after scoring during England's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine after a Comic Relief sketch.&lt;ref name="Robot"&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/5094114/Peter-Crouchs-robot-dance-and-the-10-funniest-goal-celebrations.html |title=Peter Crouch's robot dance and the 10 funniest goal celebrations|last=Wilson|first=Steve|date=2 April 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2017, Crouch gave the dance a final outing to celebrate his 100th Premier League goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38835628|title=Peter Crouch: Stoke striker 'emotional' to reach 100-goal Premier League milestone |date=2 February 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Crouch and model [[Abbey Clancy]] married on 30 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Abbey Clancy marries Peter Crouch | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/abbey-clancy-marries-peter-crouch-2305402.html | location=London | newspaper=The Independent | first=Bang | last=Showbiz | date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they have two daughters and a son, Sophia Ruby (born March 2011), Liberty Rose (born June 2015) and Johnny (born January 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baby joy for Abbey Clancy &amp; Peter Crouch |url=http://www.mrpaparazzi.com/post/14425/Its-a-girl-Baby-joy-for-Abbey-Clancy--Peter-Crouch-as-they-welcome-their-first-child.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329125630/http://www.mrpaparazzi.com/post/14425/Its-a-girl-Baby-joy-for-Abbey-Clancy--Peter-Crouch-as-they-welcome-their-first-child.aspx|archivedate=29 March 2012|work=Mr Paparazzi|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gosling |first1=Francesca |title=Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch introduce new son with social media snap |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/celebrity/abbey-clancy-and-peter-crouch-introduce-new-son-with-social-media-snap/ar-BBHTzLg?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=mailsignout |website=www.msn.com |publisher=Microsoft News |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Crouch was found guilty of [[Speed limit|speeding]] in November 2011 and ordered to pay a fine of £1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stoke City star Peter Crouch hit with £1,000 speeding fine|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/story-16739585-detail/story.html?|newspaper=The Sentinel |location=Stoke-on-Trent |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2012, Crouch was disqualified from driving for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stoke City star Peter Crouch handed driving ban|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/story-17099654-detail/story.html?|newspaper=The Sentinel |location=Stoke-on-Trent |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch released his autobiography in 2007, titled ''Walking Tall – My Story''.&lt;ref name="Walking Tall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=Peter|title=Walking Tall My Story|date=2007|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=9780340937129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His second book, ''How to be a Footballer'', was released in 2018.&lt;ref name="How to be a Footballer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=Peter|title=How to be a Footballer|date=2018|publisher=Ebury Press|isbn=978-1785039768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Autumn 2018, the first series of ''That Peter Crouch Podcast'' aired, featuring Crouch along with [[Tom Fordyce]] and [[Chris Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The natural charms of Peter Crouch shine through on his podcast |first=Antonia |last=Quirke |work=New Statesman |date=21 November 2018 |accessdate=5 January 2019 |url= https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/11/that-peter-crouch-podcast-review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=That Peter Crouch Podcast |publisher=BBC Radio 5 live |accessdate=5 January 2019 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads}}&lt;/ref&gt;
