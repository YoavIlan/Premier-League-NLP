Soon after returning to his parent club, Walker made his full debut for Sheffield United on 13 January 2009, starting in a third round [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].&lt;ref name="blades debut"&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 22 July 2009, Walker left Sheffield United to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] along with fellow defender [[Kyle Naughton]] for a combined fee of £9&amp;nbsp;million, but was loaned back to United for the duration of the 2009–10 season as part of the deal.&lt;ref name="spurs transfer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spurs capture Naughton and Walker |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/8144711.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at [[Bramall Lane]] he was virtually ever present at right back for the first half of the season but was unexpectedly recalled back to Spurs on 1 February 2010, just before the close of the January 2010 [[transfer window]], as cover for [[Alan Hutton]] who was loaned out to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] earlier the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham Hotspur recall Sheffield United's Walker |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Tottenham-Hotspur-recall-Sheffield-United39s.6034450.jp |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds |date=2 January 2010 |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker made his debut for Tottenham on Saturday 27 March 2010, in a 2–0 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name="spurs debut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham 2 Portsmouth 0: Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar pile on the pain for Pompey |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1261128/Tottenham-2-Portsmouth-0-Peter-Crouch-Niko-Kranjcar-pile-pain-Pompey.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=28 March 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ridley}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the following season, Walker went out on loan once more signing an initial six-month deal with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] (QPR) due to injuries at the club in the right back position.&lt;ref name="qpr loan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8995384.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Spurs defender Walker joins QPR |date=13 September 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October, his loan was extended until 3 January 2011.&lt;ref name="extended loan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/9093535.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=QPR extend loan of Spurs' Walker |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2017, Walker signed a five-year contract with Tottenham's Premier League rivals [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City announce signing of Kyle Walker |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2017/july/kyle-walker-joins-city |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a transfer reported to be worth an initial £45&amp;nbsp;million fee, rising to £50&amp;nbsp;million with add-ons, making it one of the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive football transfers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kyle Walker: Man City sign right-back from Tottenham for £45m plus add-ons |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40598351 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his competitive debut for City against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] on 12 August 2017, a game where many media outlets labelled him as the best player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City player ratings: Kyle Walker the pick in a humdrum display |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-player-ratings-brighton-13468298 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=£50&amp;nbsp;million man Kyle Walker impresses in debut, City see off Brighton |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/manchester-city/382/blog/post/3178393/50-million-man-kyle-walker-impresses-in-debut-manchester-city-see-off-brighton |publisher=ESPN |date=12 August 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during Walker's home debut for Manchester City he was sent off for two yellow card offences against Everton, which was thought to be a harsh decision by referee [[Bobby Madley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City 1–1 Everton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40920114 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2017 |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker was selected and part of the squad that beat Arsenal 3–0 at Wembley Stadium in the [[2018 EFL Cup Final]] to claim his and City's first trophy of the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref name=2018LC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43101681 |title=Arsenal 0–3 Manchester City |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2018 |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Before having even made a league appearance for Sheffield United, Walker was called up to the [[England national under-19 football team|England U19s]] in February 2009.&lt;ref name="england call up"&gt;{{cite web |title=Another young Blade earns England call |url=http://www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~1547871,00.html |publisher=Sheffield United F.C. |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=11 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120806003532/http://www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~1547871,00.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his début on 10 February, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3–0 loss to [[Spain national under-19 football team|Spain U19s]].&lt;ref name="england début"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kyles get international cameos |url=http://www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~1553137,00.html |publisher=Sheffield United F.C. |date=10 February 2009 |accessdate=11 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805143858/http://www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10418~1553137,00.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his first run of regular Premier League starts, Walker was called up to the full [[England national football team|England]] squad in February 2011 and again in March 2011.&lt;ref name="full england début"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fabio Capello calls up Kyle Walker for England friendly |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9388124.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not feature in any of the matches played and pulled out of the squad in March due to an injury.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

His good form in the 2011–12 [[Premier League]] season saw him named in the England squad for a friendly against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. On 12 November, Walker made his England debut in the 1–0 win over Spain, coming on for [[Scott Parker]] as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the 85th minute.&lt;ref name="bbc15693231"&gt;{{cite news |title=International friendly: England 1–0 Spain |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15693231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker went on to make his first start for England on 15 November, in a 1–0 win against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], during which he won man-of-the-match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15709627 "International friendly: England 1–0 Sweden"].

He was named in the 23-man [[England national football team|England national team]] squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44138600 |title=England World Cup squad: Trent Alexander-Arnold in 23-man squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
