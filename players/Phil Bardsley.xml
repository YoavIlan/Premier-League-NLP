'''Phillip Anthony Bardsley''' (born 28 June 1985) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. Although born in England, Bardsley qualifies for Scotland through his [[Glasgow]]-born father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/rangers/201311-phil-bardsley-called-into-scotland-squad-for-euro-2012-games/ Phil Bardsley called into Scotland squad for Euro 2012 games]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardsley began his career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].

He joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in January 2008 for an initial fee of £850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the [[Stadium of Light]] under [[Steve Bruce]] and [[Martin O'Neill]] and he won the player of the year award in [[2010–11 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2010–11]]. He lost his place in the team in [[2012–13 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2012–13]] after a falling-out with manager [[Paolo Di Canio]], before returning to the first team under [[Gus Poyet]]. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in [[2013–14 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2013–14]] and reach the [[2014 Football League Cup Final]], in which they lost 3–1 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

After his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on a free transfer. He spent three seasons with the club before joining [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in July 2017.

==Early life==
Bardsley attended [[Hope High School (Salford)|Hope High School]] in his hometown, Salford, along with former United teammates [[Mark Redshaw]] and [[Mark Howard (defender)|Mark Howard]]. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United.&lt;ref name="Sport Vibe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Redshaw – FC Oss |url=http://www.sportsvibe.co.uk/features/football/brits-abroad-11265/mark-redshaw-fc-oss-12492/ |work=Sports Vibe |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407012507/http://www.sportsvibe.co.uk/features/football/brits-abroad-11265/mark-redshaw-fc-oss-12492/ |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up near Manchester United's old training ground, [[The Cliff (training ground)|The Cliff]], and would often go there on his school holidays to see the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.&lt;ref name="Sport Vibe"/&gt;

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
After coming through the club's youth system, Bardsley was a regular in Manchester United's under-17 team from the 2000–01 season, before progressing to the under-19s from the 2002–03 season. He continued in the under-19s in [[2003–04 Manchester United F.C. season|2003–04]], but appeared more frequently in the reserves before making his first-team debut in a 2–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 3 December 2003 in the fourth round of the [[2003–04 Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baggies bounce Man Utd out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3246994.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=3 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a second appearance for the first team in the 3–0 [[FA Cup]] fourth round win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on 25 January 2004, before going on a four-month loan to Manchester United's Belgian feeder club, [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], on 30 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northampton 0–3 Man Utd|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3403761.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=25 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made six appearances for Royal Antwerp, including a 4–0 defeat to [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on 8 February 2004, in which he was sent off for two bookable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Club Brugge K.V. 4–0 R. Antwerp F.C. |url=http://www.rafcmuseum.be/wedstrijdarchief/wedstrijdfiche.php?matchid=1730 |publisher=R.A.F.C.-Museum (Royal Antwerp FC) |accessdate=23 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Manchester United at the end of 2003–04, Bardsley made three appearances on the club's [[2004–05 Manchester United F.C. season|2004–05]] pre-season tour of the United States, playing against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. He made another promising start to the [[2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season|2005–06]] season, and an injury to [[Gary Neville]] gave him plenty of opportunities to play between August and November 2005. He was regularly named as a substitute for much of the rest of the season, before going on loan to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 16 March 2006. He played six matches and scored an own goal in the first minute of a 1–1 draw at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burnley 1–1 Southampton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4842462.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Rangers====
Bardsley again made a significant contribution to Manchester United's pre-season programme in [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]], but on 16 August, he was sent out on loan again, this time to [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rangers sign up Bardsley on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4799891.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 2006, he scored his only goal for Rangers against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] with a terrific long-range free kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/5325254.stm |title=Rangers 4–0 Falkirk |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hibernians 2–1 Rangers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5345670.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2006 |accessdate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore missed the [[Old Firm]] match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. On 17 October, it was reported that Bardsley was involved in a training ground disagreement with manager [[Paul Le Guen]] and his future at Rangers appeared to be in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bardsley axed after boss bust-up |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6061000.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Bardsley never played for Rangers again and returned to Manchester United in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Trafford duo make Ibrox exit |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6216885.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Aston Villa====
On 8 January 2007, Bardsley joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on loan until the end of the season and played his first [[Premier League]] match against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tactical Formation |work=Football-Lineups.com |url=http://www.football-lineups.com/wiki/_match3473.php |accessdate=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 1 May that Bardsley would be returning to Manchester United when his loan deal with Villa ran out as manager [[Martin O'Neill]] did not want to make the move permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phil's United Return |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1019107,00.html |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |date=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006014134/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1019107,00.html |archivedate=6 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Sheffield United====
After playing what would turn out to be his last match for the Manchester United first team against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the League Cup on 26 September 2007, it was confirmed on 15 October Bardsley would join [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on loan until January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd's Bardsley in Blades loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/7044929.stm |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full debut for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 draw with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at Bramall Lane. Despite Sheffield United agreeing a deal with Manchester United to sign him permanently,&lt;ref name="Bardsley loan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bardsley Deal Fear |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-united/Bardsley-deal-fear.3645259.jp |work=Sheffield Star |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley left at the end of his loan deal in January 2008 after playing 16 matches.

===Sunderland===
[[File:Phil Bardsley 2.jpg|thumb|Bardsley for Sunderland in a pre-season friendly against [[York City F.C.|York City]]]]
On 22 January 2008, Bardsley joined Sunderland on a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth an initial £850,000, potentially rising to £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunderland complete Bardsley signing |url=http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=14043 |work=safc.com |publisher=Sunderland AFC |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124045034/http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=14043 |archivedate=24 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bardsley makes Sunderland switch|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7203422.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in a 2–0 win against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Premier League on 29 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunderland 2–0 Birmingham|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7210578.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley played 11 times under [[Roy Keane]] in [[2007–08 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2007–08]] as Sunderland successfully avoided relegation by three points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keane brings out best in Bardsley|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7340689.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Keane prepares to wield axe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7381027.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2008 Bardsley scored his first goal in English football in a 2–1 victory against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottm Forest 1–2 Sunderland (aet) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7576515.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley lost out to [[Pascal Chimbonda]] during the first half of the [[2008–09 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2008–09]] campaign before regaining his place in the team in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bardsley determined to keep place|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7742062.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his place under [[Ricky Sbragia]], playing in total 33 times in 2008–09 as Sunderland survived relegation on the final day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanghera|first=Mandeep|title=Sunderland 2–3 Chelsea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048317.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008/09"/&gt;

[[File:Phil Bardsley cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bardsley playing for Sunderland in 2012]]
