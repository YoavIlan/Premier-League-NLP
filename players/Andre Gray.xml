Gray remained with Hinckley for the [[2011–12 Football Conference#Conference North|2011–12 season]] and showed fine form, with his goalscoring exploits firing the Knitters to an [[FA Cup]] first round proper match versus [[Conference Premier]] club [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] on 12 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hinckley Utd 2–2 Tamworth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15604826 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the opening goal in the 2–2 draw, but couldn't find the net in the replay, resulting in a 1–0 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tamworth 1–0 Hinckley Utd |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15732449 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray also helped Hinckley reach the second round proper of the [[FA Trophy]], scoring a late winner against Conference Premier club [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in the first round,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FA Trophy: Wrexham 1–2 Hinckley United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16118988 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was unable to find the net against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the following round, to whom they were defeated 3–0 in a replay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luton 3–0 Hinckley |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/luton-vs-hinckley/255449 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His exploits garnered him attention from [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs.&lt;ref name="It's official: Town get Gray"&gt;{{cite web |title=It's official: Town get Gray |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~2687930,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=22 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324184401/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~2687930%2C00.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray made 45 appearances and scored 23 goals during the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref name="Non-League Club Directory 2013 1"/&gt; Gray departed Hinckley in the summer of 2012, having made 85 appearances and scored 37 goals across his two spells with the club.&lt;ref name="Non-League Club Directory 2011 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Non-League Club Directory 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Non-League Club Directory 2013 1"/&gt; Gray looked back on his years playing part-time with Hinckley as the point at which he regained his focus, saying "as long as I still had a job and was getting paid, it was OK. Until I started playing and realised that full-time football was the only thing I wanted to do, it kicked me into gear. Being bored all day, waiting to go training, made me really want it".&lt;ref name="Andre Gray Bossing Things Both On And Off The Pitch"/&gt;
