'''Ederson Santana de Moraes''' (born 17 August 1993), known simply as '''Ederson''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɛdɛɾsõ|br}}), is a Brazilian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]]. He is considered the world's most expensive goalkeeper from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/239/en/ |title=Updated transfer valuations: Mbappé takes the lead |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=5 November 2018 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career at [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] in 2008 before joining Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] one year later, where he would spend two seasons. In 2012, he transferred from [[G.D. Ribeirão|Ribeirão]] to [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]] and became a regular starter there. He rejoined Benfica in 2015 and was assigned to the [[S.L. Benfica B|reserves]] before debuting for the first team, with whom he would win four major titles in two seasons.

For the 2017–18 season, Ederson joined English club Manchester City for £35 million and became the most expensive goalkeeper of all-time in terms of the nominal value of [[pound sterling]] at the time of his transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=8 June 2017|title=Ederson Moraes:Manchester City sign goalkeeper from Benfica for £35 million|trans-title=Most expensive goalkeeper in history in sterling|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40080163|website=BBC Sport|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the Premier League and [[EFL Cup]] in [[2017–18 Manchester City F.C. season|his first season]] in England.

Ederson made his senior debut for Brazil in 2017 after previously being [[Cap (sport)|capped]] at [[Brazil national under-23 football team|under-23]] level. He was chosen in Brazil's squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career / Rio Ave===
Born in [[Osasco]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Ederson started his [[association football|football]] career in 2008 at local club [[São Paulo FC]] with whom he played one season, before joining [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in Portugal. Here, at the age of 16, he spent two years as a [[S.L. Benfica Juniors|junior]], eventually leaving for [[Portuguese Second Division|Second Division]] side [[G.D. Ribeirão|Ribeirão]] in 2011. A year later, he joined [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]]. In summer 2012, he officially signed a contract with Rio Ave. In May 2015, following a string of good performances and a call to the [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil under-23 squad]], he signed a new contract with the club that would last until 2019.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Benfica===
[[File:Zenit-Benf (7).jpg|alt=|thumb|318x318px|left|Ederson playing for [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] against [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] in 2016]]
On 27 June 2015, Ederson joined Portuguese champions Benfica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/benfica/interior/conheca-os-novos-reforcos-do-benfica-4648648.html|title=Conheça os 10 novos reforços do Benfica|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Meet the 10 new Benfica players|last=Ruela|first=João|date=27 June 2015|publisher=[[Diário de Notícias]]|access-date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in July, he officially signed a five-year contract with the club, in a deal worth €500,000, and set a €45 million release clause. Rio Ave would keep 50% of the upcoming keeper's economic rights. In the [[2015–16 S.L. Benfica season|2015–16 season]], Ederson started as a second choice in line for the first team, defended by compatriot and international [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]]. Ederson first played some matches in the [[Segunda Liga]] with the [[S.L. Benfica B|reserve team]] and in the [[Taça da Liga]] with the main squad, before playing in the Primeira Liga on 5 March 2016 against [[Derby de Lisboa|local rivals]] [[Sporting CP]], replacing injured Júlio César. Benfica won the Lisbon derby 0–1 and took the first place of Primeira Liga. He would then be part of eleven more victories that would seal Benfica's 35th league title, their third in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefinalball.com/player_results.php?id=136885&amp;epoca_id=145&amp;ps=0|title=Ederson Moraes|website=thefinalball.com|access-date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, he played the [[2016 Taça da Liga Final|Taça da Liga final]] against [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]], which Benfica won 6–2. In addition, he played three matches in the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|Champions League campaign]], where Benfica reached the quarter-finals. In his [[2016–17 S.L. Benfica season|next season]], he and Benfica won the treble of [[2016–17 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]], [[2016–17 Taça de Portugal|Taça de Portugal]] and [[2016 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira]].

===Manchester City===
[[File:Ederson Moraes (36243872090) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Ederson with Manchester City in 2017]]
On 1 June 2017, Benfica announced that Ederson had joined [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £35 million (€40 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 June 2017|title=Ederson transferido para o Manchester City|trans-title=Ederson transferred to Manchester City|url=http://www.slbenfica.pt/30/news/info/t8JYPAn5zkKsW8hlgu_4Dg|language=Portuguese|website=S.L.

Ederson was immediately inserted as [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first choice goalkeeper, supplanting [[Claudio Bravo]]. He made his competitive debut for the club on 12 August 2017 in a 0–2 away win at [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]], where he kept a clean sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 August 2017|title=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0–2 Manchester City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40835422|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Ederson suffered a kick to the face by [[Sadio Mané]], and was forced to leave the game after eight minutes of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-city/story/3199384/manchester-city-keeper-ederson-avoids-broken-bone-but-may-miss-one-game |title=Man City keeper Ederson avoids broken bone, may miss one game |work=ESPN FC |first=Jonathan |last=Smith |date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ederson received eight stitches, and Mané was sent off by referee [[Jonathan Moss (referee)|Jon Moss]] and banned for the subsequent three matches.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Ederson made his next start the following week in the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League#Group stage|Champions League]] against [[Feyenoord]], sporting a piece of protective headgear.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 19 August 2018, Ederson became the first Manchester City goalkeeper in [[Premier League]] history to have recorded an assist, as his goal-kick was converted by [[Sergio Agüero]] for the opening goal in an eventual 6–1 win over [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-city-6-huddersfield-1-sergio-aguero-scores-hattrick-as-terriers-are-hit-for-six-a3915101.html|title=Aguero scores hat-trick as Man City hit Huddersfield for six|work=Evening Standard|access-date=20 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/ederson-makes-man-city-history-with-assist-against-huddersfield/1054269#IWl6mfS2YFRpicyy.97|title=Ederson makes Man City history with assist against Huddersfield|work=Squawka Football News|access-date=20 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
