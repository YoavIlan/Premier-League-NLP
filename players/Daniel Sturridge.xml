'''Daniel Andre Sturridge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ʌr|ɪ|dʒ}}; born 1 September 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]]. 

Born in [[Birmingham]], Sturridge spent four years in the [[Aston Villa Under-21s and Academy|Aston Villa academy]] before moving to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. He then signed for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2003. He continued his development at City and played in two [[FA Youth Cup]] finals. He made his first-team debut in the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]], becoming the only player ever to score in the FA Youth Cup, [[FA Cup]] and Premier League in the same season. He left City in 2009 and signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], where he was loaned out to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] for the second half of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]]. After a successful spell at Bolton, scoring eight goals in 12 appearances, he returned to Chelsea for the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]].

===Manchester City===
From the start of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season, Sturridge began to train with the City first team. A [[hat-trick]] in a reserve match was rewarded by a place on the substitutes' bench for the senior team's match with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in February 2007.&lt;ref name=mcfcprofile/&gt; He duly made his debut from the bench, replacing [[Georgios Samaras]] for the final quarter-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Culley |first=John |title=Manchester City 0 Reading 2: Lita strikes twice to disprove Pearce's doubts |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-0-reading-2-lita-strikes-twice-to-disprove-pearces-doubts-435128.html |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a second substitute appearance a month later, but then suffered a hip injury which sidelined him for the remainder of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Chris |title=Daniel's despair after hip op |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/daniels-despair-after-hip-op-1004101 |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturridge scored his first goal for City on 27 January 2008 in an FA Cup match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], followed three days later by his first league goal on his full debut, against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Martin |title=Daniel Sturridge – Manchester City's rising star |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2290607/Daniel-Sturridge---Manchester-City%27s-rising-star.html |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, first-team opportunities were sporadic, so Sturridge continued to play for the youth team in the FA Youth Cup. City again reached the final, with Sturridge the leading scorer in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbert |first=Ian |title=Cassell prepares the ground for City's stars of the future |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/cassell-prepares-the-ground-for-citys-stars-of-the-future-809460.html |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time City won the final, with Sturridge scoring in the first leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City lift Youth Cup |publisher=The Football Association |url=http://www.thefa.com/News/competitions/fa-youth-cup/2008/dec/FAComp_YCFinal_2008 |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season, Sturridge became the only player ever to score in the Youth FA Cup, the FA Cup and the Premier League in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daniel Sturridge interview |publisher=Manchester City v Portsmouth match programme |date=21 September 2008 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturridge contributed in the 2008–09 season with 26 appearances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Few regrets over Sturridge – 'the one that got away' |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-city-dont-regret-letting-7205259 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scoring 4 goals.&lt;ref name="sb0809"/&gt; On 28 December 2008, in a league match against [[Blackburn Rovers]], City was trailing at by 2–0. Coming on as a 71st-minute substitute, Sturridge scored in the 88th minute of the match owing taking advantage of a header by [[André Ooijer]]. He also went on to assist [[Robinho]]'s injury time goal. Manager [[Mark Hughes]] said that Sturridge was a player with great potential and had an impact in the game. He also praised his assist, saying "he picked out Robinho for the equaliser in an area where we had been struggling to find him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blackburn 2–2 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7788425.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 January 2018 |date=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he was voted as the club's Young Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City to demand £7m from Chelsea for Daniel Sturridge at tribunal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/6928187/Manchester-City-to-demand-7m-from-Chelsea-for-Daniel-Sturridge-at-tribunal.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===

The [[Professional Football Compensation Committee]] decided on 14 January 2010 that Chelsea would pay an initial fee of [[£]]3.5&amp;nbsp;million, with additional payments of £500,000 after each of 10, 20, 30 and 40 appearances. There would also be a further payment of £1&amp;nbsp;million if Sturridge made a full international appearance, and Manchester City in addition would receive 15 percent of any sell-on fee if Sturridge was transferred, after these add ons the fee for the player reached an eventual fee of £8.3m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1932749,00.html |title=Daniel Sturridge statement |date=14 January 2010 |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517124622/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1932749,00.html |archivedate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/04/24/burnley-hope-danny-ings-fee-will-set-record-as-liverpool-argue-a/ |title=Burnley hope Danny Ings fee will set record as Liverpool argue against}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Daniel Sturridge.JPG|thumb|upright|Sturridge playing for [[England national under-21 football team|England U21s]] in 2009]]

On 6 November 2011, Sturridge was handed his maiden England call-up by being named in the England squad for the friendlies against Spain and Sweden, after excelling for Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/06/daniel-sturridge-jack-rodwell-england |title=Daniel Sturridge named in Capello's England squad |accessdate=6 November 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/15614738.stm |title=Daniel Sturridge in England squad |accessdate=6 November 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unused substitute in a 1–0 victory against Spain, but [[Fabio Capello]] insisted that Sturridge would play against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] the following Tuesday and did, as he made his debut coming on as a second-half substitute for [[Theo Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=International friendly: England 1–0 Sweden |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/15709627 |accessdate=5 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his second appearance against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] coming on in the first half for the injured Steven Gerrard and caused the Dutch defence problems throughout the match and earned the [[man of the match]] award for his efforts during the match.

He scored his first senior goal for England in his fifth match on 22 March 2013, after coming on for [[Wayne Rooney]] in an 8–0 away win against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in World Cup qualification.&lt;ref name="San Marino 0–8 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21653049 |title=San Marino 0–8 England |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 March 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal meant he had made an appearance and scored for all levels of international football for England, from U16 to the seniors, as well as scoring for the [[Great Britain Olympic football team]]. On 11 October, he scored another goal in England's qualification campaign, an injury-time penalty in a 4–1 win over [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] after he had been fouled by [[Ivan Kecojević]].&lt;ref name="England 4–1 Montenegro"&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=England 4–1 Montenegro |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24393746 |accessdate=7 April 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again in the opening match of 2014, England's March friendly with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].&lt;ref name=denmark2014&gt;{{cite news |last=Ornstein |first=David |title=England 1–0 Denmark |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26349068 |accessdate=5 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was 0–0 until the eighty-second minute, when Sturridge rose to head an [[Adam Lallana]] cross into the net for a late winner.&lt;ref name=denmark2014/&gt;

====2014 FIFA World Cup====
In May 2014, Sturridge was named in England's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and assigned the number 9 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/may/world-cup-squad-numbers-announced-210514 |title=England's World Cup squad numbers confirmed |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the team's opening goal in a 3–0 friendly defeat of [[Peru national football team|Peru]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 30 May.&lt;ref name="England 3–0 Peru"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 3–0 Peru |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27383301 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June, Sturridge started England's opening match of the tournament and scored the team's goal in a 2–1 defeat by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Manaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/england-italy-world-cup-2014-group-d-match-report |title=Italy's Mario Balotelli leaves England's Group D hopes in the balance |date=15 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UEFA Euro 2016====
Despite injury keeping him out of most of the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification]] phase, Sturridge was named in England's squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] finals. In the team's second group match, after appearing as a half time substitute against [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Sturridge assisted [[Jamie Vardy]]'s equaliser and scored the winning goal as the team recovered from a 1–0 deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/england-wales-euro-2016-match-report |title=Euro 2016: Sturridge leaves it late as England come back to beat Wales |date=16 June 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Sturridge v Stoke City 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Sturridge playing for Liverpool in 2013]]

Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said, "Daniel offers a few of the characteristics I had with [[Hulk (footballer)|Hulk]] when I was with him in [[FC Porto|Porto]]... He is an extremely quick player, and he has technique at pace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/8801185/Chelsea-manager-Andre-Villas-Boas-says-Daniel-Sturridge-is-a-really-big-talent-ahead-of-Bolton-Wandrerers-test.html |title=Sturridge 'a really big talent' |accessdate=1 October 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Duncan |last=White |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturridge said he preferred to play as a centre-forward rather than as a wide player: "I do still see myself as a striker but I am doing a job for the team and I'm enjoying doing it." As Sturridge transitioned from a wider role into a striker when he joined Liverpool, Sturridge also said that he likens himself on striker [[Thierry Henry]], who "played wide for Juventus and then went to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and played as a centre-forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7595924/Sturridge-I-m-a-striker |title=Sturridge – I'm a striker |accessdate=14 March 2012 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he rarely played for Chelsea as a striker, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers played Sturridge as a striker in most matches. His ability to still drop between lines and pull wide and attack defences, similar to former strike partner Luis Suárez's playing-style, has led to Rodgers describing him as "what I call a '[[Forward (association football)#Second striker|nine-and-a-half]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/brendan-rodgers-willing-to-tinker-with-liverpool-formation-to-exploit-the-strengths-of-our-players-8859191.html |title=Brendan Rodgers willing to tinker with Liverpool formation to 'exploit the strengths of our players' |accessdate=4 October 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |first=Carl |last=Markham |date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
