'''Adam Richard Legzdins''' (born 28 November 1986) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

Legzdins began his career with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], from where he spent time on loan at several lower-division clubs but never played first-team football for his parent club. In 2008, he joined [[Crewe Alexandra]], with whom he made his debut in [[the Football League]], but played only infrequently. He spent the 2010–11 season as [[Football League Two]] club [[Burton Albion]]'s first-choice goalkeeper, earning himself a move to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] of the [[Football League Championship]]. He played 35 matches over three seasons with Derby, mainly in 2012–13, and after a year with [[Leyton Orient]], he rejoined Birmingham City in 2015. After two seasons and 21 appearances, he signed for Burnley.

He qualifies to play international football for [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] via his paternal grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/local/Saturday-Spotlight--Adam39s-here.1261084.jp |title=Saturday Spotlight – Adam's here to learn |newspaper=Halifax Courier |date=19 November 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Legzdins was born in [[Penkridge]], Staffordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hugman |editor1-first=Barry J. |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2007–08 |publisher=Mainstream |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |page=245 |isbn=978-1-84596-246-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came through [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'s [[Birmingham City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Academy]] system and played his first competitive football in October 2005 on [[loan (association football)|loan]] at [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]] in the [[Conference North]], four games which included a [[man of the match]] performance away at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alfretontownfc.com/herefordunited221005report.htm |title=2005/06 season match No.14 |author=Foster, Gordon |publisher=Alfreton Town F.C. |date=23 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115233421/http://www.alfretontownfc.com/herefordunited221005report.htm |archivedate=15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] of the [[Conference National]] on a work experience basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/4417624.stm |title=Shaymen seal swoop for Legzdins |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played 11 games before Birmingham recalled him, concerned that regular [[first-team]] football for Halifax combined with playing for Birmingham's [[reserve team]] was too much for the 19-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/4642604.stm |title=Shaymen lose City keeper Legzdins |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamLegzdins cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Warming up before a [[Football League Championship|Championship]] match at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], August 2006]]Legzdins signed his first one-year professional contract in the summer of 2006. Early in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] he was given a Birmingham squad number because of an injury to first choice keeper [[Maik Taylor]], and was an unused [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in their [[Football League Championship|Championship]] match at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10412~35971,00.html |title=Adam Legzdins |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514131236/http://www.blues.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0%2C%2C10412~35971%2C00.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 he joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on loan where he acted as backup to [[Les Pogliacomi]], making one substitute appearance in the [[Football League Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oldham_athletic/6181952.stm |title=Oldham extend Legzdins' loan deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 November 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] on loan and was expected to go straight into the starting eleven due to injury and suspension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/macclesfield_town/s/233062_preview_barnet_v_macclesfield |title=Preview: Barnet v Macclesfield |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |author=Carter, Simon |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but manager [[Paul Ince]] chose goalkeeping coach [[David Rouse]] instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10393~33003,00.html |title=Barnet 1 Macclesfield 0 |last=Brooks |first=Nick |publisher=Macclesfield Town F.C. |date=13 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326170152/http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10393~33003%2C00.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Legzdins completed his month's loan without appearing for the club. He played an active part in helping [[Birmingham City F.C.

Legzdins made his first team debut for Crewe in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 11 August 2009, after loan goalkeeper [[David Button]] returned to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Derby manager [[Nigel Clough]] said that he would be backup to first choice keeper [[Frank Fielding]].&lt;ref name="DCFC Move"/&gt; Legzdins made his debut for Derby away at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] after Fielding was sent off after only a minute, and contributed to a 2–1 win against their [[Derby County F.C.–Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|local rivals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/14864055.stm |title=Nottm Forest 1–2 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2012, Legzdins rejoined former club Burton Albion on a month's emergency loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17443314 |title=Burton bring back Derby County goalkeeper Adam Legzdins |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was restricted to just one appearance by a hip injury suffered in a 1–0 defeat against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and returned to Derby on 17 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/17042012/63/legzdins-rams.html |title=Legzdins back with Rams |publisher=Eurosport Yahoo |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120726233537/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/17042012/63/legzdins-rams.html |archivedate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his third appearance for Derby four days later as a half-time substitute for Fielding away at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]; Derby won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17711036 |title=Portsmouth 1–2 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 April 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the final game of the season, a 1–1 draw against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17796190 |title=Derby 1–1 Peterborough |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legzdins again started the season as second-choice goalkeeper.

It was a very important save."&lt;ref name="briscgame"/&gt; Legzdins' run of 30 consecutive first-team starts ended in March 2013 when Clough felt the need for Fielding's greater experience ahead of Derby's 2–1 win against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Centre-halves-won-Leicester-game-says-Derby/story-18449567-detail/story.html |title=Centre-halves 'won us the Leicester game,' says Derby County's Nigel Clough |newspaper=Derby Telegraph |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526021548/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Centre-halves-won-Leicester-game-says-Derby/story-18449567-detail/story.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five weeks later, Legzdins returned to first-team action after Fielding was sent off for a professional foul against Peterborough United,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133302 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Derby 3–1 Peterborough |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he started the final two games of the season, ending the season with 33 first-team appearances. After Derby signed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]'s [[Lee Grant (footballer born 1983)|Lee Grant]] in May, Legzdins was made available for transfer with a year left on his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-listen-offers-Fielding-Legzdins/story-18914541-detail/story.html |newspaper=Derby Telegraph |first=Steve |last=Nicholson |title=Rams will listen to offers for Fielding and Legzdins |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002512/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Rams-listen-offers-Fielding-Legzdins/story-18914541-detail/story.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legzdins was originally not given a squad number for the [[2013–14 Derby County F.C. season|2013–14 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/2013-14-squad-numbers-announced-915805.aspx |publisher=Derby County F.C. |title=2013–14 squad numbers announced|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after featuring in first-team pre-season friendlies he was assigned the squad number 26 in late July and went into the season as second choice to Grant.

===Leyton Orient===
Legzdins signed for [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on 13 June 2014. He signed a two-year contract with the East London club after being released by Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Legzdins: Leyton Orient sign Derby County goalkeeper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27835791 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the club by mutual consent on 1 June 2015 after his appearances during the 2014–15 season were restricted by injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32962766 |title=Adam Legzdins: Leyton Orient terminate keeper's contract |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first league appearance of the [[2016–17 Birmingham City F.C. season|2016–17 season]] when Kuszczak succumbed to a pre-existing injury during the warm-up before Birmingham's match away to Reading on 13 September; he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-11883348 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett on Adam Legzdins' first team prospects after surprise chance |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place for the next seven matches, even after Kuszczak's return to fitness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-12059078 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett gives his thoughts on Adam Legzdins |first=Joseph |last=Chapman |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but manager [[Gary Rowett]] brought Kuszczak back into the side for the [[Second City derby|local derby]] against [[Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-boss-gary-rowett-12103526 |title=Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett discusses decision to drop Adam Legzdins |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=31 October 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four more appearances in the second half of the season: two in the FA Cup,&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; and two in the league, on both occasions as a half-time substitute for the injured Kuszczak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-gianfranco-zola-head-12487264 |title=Birmingham City: Gianfranco Zola on the head injury to Tomasz Kuszczak |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=21 January 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/report?gameId=452702 |title=Birmingham City 0–2 Burton Albion |publisher=ESPN |agency=PA Sport |date=17 April 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Birmingham took up their option to extend his contract for a further year, Legzdins said he was "absolutely delighted" to accept, in preference to offers from elsewhere, "because everybody who knows me knows how much the club means to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-legzdins-happy-pick-birmingham-13099396 |title=Adam Legzdins happy to pick Birmingham City over other offers |first=Brian |last=Dick |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=27 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnley===
The arrival of [[David Stockdale]] left Legzdins third in Birmingham's pecking order for 2017–18, and [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] were in need of a goalkeeper after [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]]'s retirement left them without sufficient backup for [[Tom Heaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ex-burton-albion-goalkeeper-adam-297582 |title=Ex-Burton Albion goalkeeper Adam Legzdins linked with Premier League move away from Birmingham City |first=Josh |last=Murray |newspaper=Burton Mail |date=8 August 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2017, Legzdins signed a three-year contract with Burnley; the fee was undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2017/august/clarets-sign-legzdins/ |title=Clarets sign Legzdins |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=8 August 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
