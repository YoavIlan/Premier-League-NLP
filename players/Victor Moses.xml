'''Victor Moses''' (born 12 December 1990) is a Nigerian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] on either flank for [[Süper Lig]] club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Moses began his career in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], before his performances caught the eye of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], where he made his [[Premier League]] debut in 2010. After two years, his game had improved to the extent that European champions Chelsea were interested, and he signed for them in the summer of 2012. Despite ten goals in all competitions during his first season, he spent his second season on [[loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], his third on loan at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and his fourth on loan at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].

Born in Nigeria, Moses represented [[England national youth football team|England youth teams]] at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels, but opted to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] as opposed to being fully [[cap (sport)|cap]]ped for [[England national football team|England]]. He has gained over 35 caps for Nigeria since his debut in 2012 and played in their winning campaign at the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]], as well as the campaign in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early life===
Moses was born in [[Lagos]], Nigeria,&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; the son of a Christian pastor. When he was 11, his parents were killed in [[Miss World riots|religious riots]] in [[Kaduna]] when rioters invaded their home. Moses was playing football in the street at the time. A week later, after being hidden by friends, his relatives paid for him to travel to the UK to claim asylum. He was placed with a foster family in South London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/14/victor-moses-interview-chelsea|title=Victor Moses: they should be proud of me, looking down being proud|last=Hytner|first=David|date=2012-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MosesAsylum"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kelso |first= Paul |date=20 May 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/may/20/football.immigration |title=14-year-old asylum seeker becomes school's football hero |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 July 2008 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent1"&gt;{{cite news|title=FA Cup: Orphaned Victor Moses feels very much at home with Chelsea|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/fa-cup-orphaned-victor-moses-feels-very-much-at-home-with-chelsea-8527874.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Harris Academy South Norwood|Stanley Technical High School]] (now known as the Harris Academy) in [[South Norwood]]. Scouted playing football in the local Tandridge League for Cosmos 90 FC, [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] approached him, with the club's [[Selhurst Park]] stadium just streets away from his school.&lt;ref name="Independent1"/&gt;

Offered a place in the Eagles' academy, Palace recommended him to the fee-paying [[Whitgift School]] in [[Croydon]], where former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] star [[Colin Pates]] was coaching the school football team.&lt;ref name="Independent1"/&gt; Moses first came to prominence at 14 after scoring 50 goals for Palace's under-14s side. Playing for three years at both Whitgift and Palace, Moses scored over 100 goals as well as helping Whitgift win many School Cups, including a National Cup where Moses scored all five goals in the final against [[Healing School]] of [[Grimsby]] at the [[Walkers Stadium]], Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking back at when Liverpool and Chelsea ace Victor Moses stunned Healing's dream team |url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Looking-Liverpool-Chelsea-ace-Victor-Moses/story-20471306-detail/story.html |website=Grimsby Telegraph |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112012838/http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Looking-Liverpool-Chelsea-ace-Victor-Moses/story-20471306-detail/story.html |archivedate=12 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Palace===
Moses made his first team debut for Palace at the age of 16 on 6 November 2007 in a 1–1 draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff 1–1 Crystal Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7076416.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept his place in the side thereafter and scored his first senior goal on 12 March 2008 in a 1–1 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Brom 1–1 Crystal Palace|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7287966.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Moses played 16 times in [[2007–08 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2007–08]] as Palace reached the [[2008 Football League play-offs#Championship|Championship play-offs]] where they lost out to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol City v C Palace as it happened|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7399418.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he signed a new contract at Selhurst Park, much to delight of manager [[Neil Warnock]], who stated, "Victor signing is a huge coup for the club; I've told Victor he could go as high as he wants. He's improving every day and I am delighted that he has signed this deal as he is a player who will go from strength to strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moses signs four-year Palace deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7529661.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses score twice in 32 appearances in [[2008–09 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2008–09]] as Palace had a disappointing campaign, finishing in 15th position.&lt;ref name=sb0809&gt;{{Soccerbase season|47716|2008|name=Victor Moses|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2009–10 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2009–10]], Moses went on a run of six goals in eight matches but Palace were suffering huge financial problems and the club went into administration in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace deducted 10 points|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8484824.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wigan Athletic===
On the final day of January 2010, he completed a £2.5 million transfer to [[Premier League]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] after Palace went into administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = 31 January 2010| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/crystalpalace/7121319/Victor-Moses-joins-Wigan-Athletic-as-Crystal-Palace-fire-sale-begins.html| title = Victor Moses joins Wigan Athletic as Crystal Palace fire sale begins| newspaper = The Daily Telegraph| accessdate = 31 January 2010| location = London| first = Jonathan| last = Liew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his debut on 6 February 2010 as a substitute against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8493730.stm|title=Sunderland 1–1 Wigan|date=6 February 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 March 2010, Moses came on as a substitute against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and got his first assist for the club, setting up [[Hugo Rodallega]] for an injury time winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2001372,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612181312/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~2001372,00.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |title=Victor-ious |publisher= Wigan Athletic FC|date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Wigan on 3 May 2010 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8649742.stm| title = Wigan 2–2 Hull| publisher= BBC Sport| date = 3 May 2010| accessdate = 3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses picked up two injuries at the start of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clicklancashire.com/my-click/my-real-life/127932-wigan-athletic-winger-victor-moses-wants-tottenham-hotspur-shot.html |title=Wigan Athletic winger Victor Moses wants Tottenham Hotspur shot |work=Click Lancashire |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202954/http://www.clicklancashire.com/my-click/my-real-life/127932-wigan-athletic-winger-victor-moses-wants-tottenham-hotspur-shot.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and found it difficult to make it back into the first-team due to increased competition for places. He scored his first league goal of the season on 13 November 2010 in a 1–0 win against West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/moses-and-nzogbia-lead-wigan-out-of-wilderness-2133596.html| title = Moses and N'Zogbia lead Wigan out of wilderness| date = 14 November 2010| accessdate = 16 November 2010| location = London| newspaper = The Independent| first = Darren| last = Witcoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of winger [[Charles N'Zogbia]], Moses became a regular starter for Wigan in the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]]. On 10 December 2011, he scored his first goal of the season against West Brom&amp;nbsp;– his first goal since scoring against the same team last season.

Moses made his full debut for Chelsea when he started the [[Football League Cup#Third round|League Cup]] game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and scored his first goal after 71 minutes in a game that finished 6–0 to the Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19632463 |title=Chelsea 6–0 Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses started his first [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group E|Champions League]] game against [[FC Nordsjælland|Nordsjælland]]. On 31 October, Moses was named [[Man of the Match]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]], a game Chelsea won 5–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_0_17387_chelsea-focus-revenge-is-sweet-in-man-utd-win.html |title=Chelsea Focus&amp;nbsp;– Revenge is sweet in Man Utd win |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104075335/http://www.adifferentleague.co.uk/p6_0_17387_chelsea-focus-revenge-is-sweet-in-man-utd-win.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2012, Moses scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea in the match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], which ended in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/us/en/report/345755/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901|title=Swansea 1–1 Chelsea|publisher=ESPN FC|date=3 November 2012 |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he scored his first Champions League goal for Chelsea against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]; Moses replaced [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] in the 79th minute and went on to head in [[Juan Mata]]'s corner with seconds left to secure a 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20150427 |title=Chelsea 3–2 Shakhtar Donetsk |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 2013, Moses opened his scoring tally for the year with a powerful drive into the bottom corner whilst playing in the [[FA Cup]] Third Round against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], as Chelsea came from 1–0 behind to beat the Saints 1–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20863303 |title=Demba Ba scored twice on his Chelsea debut as the FA Cup holders came from behind against Southampton to ease into the fourth round at St Mary's Stadium. |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2013, Moses signed for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on a season-long [[loan (sports)|loan]] deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/media-watch/sky-sports-moses-deal-completed |title=Moses deal completed |publisher=Liverpool FC |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905103418/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/media-watch/sky-sports-moses-deal-completed |archivedate=5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored on his debut on 16 September against Swansea City in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24012560|title= Swansea 2 Liverpool 2 |date=16 September 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season: Loan to Stoke City====
On 16 August 2014, Moses joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on loan for the [[2014–15 Stoke City F.C. season|2014–15]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moses moves to Stoke|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2014/08/moses-moves-to-stoke.html|website=Chelsea F.C|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut for Stoke City on 30 August in a 1–0 win away at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 0–1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28907276|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoke's 1–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 29 September, Moses provided the assist for the lone goal scored by [[Peter Crouch]] and was voted [[Man of the Match]] for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 1–0 Newcastle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29305924|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, in a 2–1 win against Swansea City, Moses won a penalty after going down under a challenge from [[Àngel Rangel]]; after the match, Swansea manager [[Garry Monk]] claimed that Moses dived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–1 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29586592|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swansea boss Garry Monk criticises 'cheat' Victor Moses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29682896|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Match of the Day 2]]'' pundit [[John Hartson]] also claimed Moses had cheated, but later apologised to Moses for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hartson apologises to Stoke's Victor Moses over 'cheat' claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29770009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses scored his first goal for Stoke on 1 November in a 2–2 draw with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–2 West Ham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29768017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a thigh injury against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 22 November which ruled him out for eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Moses: Stoke City striker faces eight weeks out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30210377|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2015, Moses returned to the starting line-up against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], which ended in a 1–0 win for Stoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leicester City vs Stoke City|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/01/17/england/premier-league/leicester-city-fc/stoke-city-fc/1703921/|website=Soccerway|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, Moses scored a 90th-minute penalty to earn Stoke a 2–1 victory over Midlands rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aston Villa 1–2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31466727|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored in a 2–0 victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 4 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke 2–0 Everton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31616988|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[André Schürrle]] and [[Mohamed Salah]] leaving on a permanent basis and on loan, respectively, it was announced that Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] attempted to recall Moses back from Stoke mid-season, only for the winger to reject the move back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victor Moses rejected return to Chelsea|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11486800/Victor-Moses-rejected-return-to-Chelsea.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses suffered a hamstring injury whilst playing against West Ham on 11 April, which ruled him out for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victor Moses returns to Stamford Bridge with injury|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11535854/Chelsea-news-Victor-Moses-returns-to-Stamford-Bridge-with-injury.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season: Loan to West Ham United====

After a successful season on loan with Stoke, Moses returned to the Blues and made appearances in all four of the preseason games and scored once, against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Saint-Germain 1–1 Chelsea |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/live-commentary/live-commentary-psg-vs-chelsea_235428.html |date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses made his first competitive appearance since the return on 2 August 2015 against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for the [[2015 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] when he replaced [[John Terry]] in the 82nd minute. The match ended with Chelsea losing 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Community Shield: Arsenal vs Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/33500342 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was also included on the bench during the first game of the season against Swansea City, although he did not make an appearance as Chelsea drew 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/08/england/premier-league/chelsea-football-club/swansea-city-afc/2043051/ |title=Chelsea vs. Swansea City 2 – 2 (8/8/15) |date=8 August 2015 |publisher=Soccerway }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2015, Moses joined West Ham United on a season-long loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Moses signs on loan |url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/September/1-September/Moses-signs-on-loan |publisher=West Ham United |date=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902153252/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/September/1-September/Moses-signs-on-loan |archivedate=2 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining West Ham United on loan, Moses signed a new four-year contract, which will keep him at Chelsea until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=New Deal for Moses |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/08/new-deal-for-moses.html |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses made his West Ham debut on 14 September in a 2–0 home win against Newcastle United, where he was named Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34171138 | title=West Ham 2–0 Newcastle United | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second game, on 19 September away against Manchester City, Moses scored his only West Ham goal, in a 1–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34191909 | title=Manchester City 1–2 West Ham | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, during the match against Manchester United, Moses suffered a hamstring injury that ruled him out until February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espnfc.us/west-ham-united/story/2744994/west-ham-forward-victor-moses-to-undergo-scan-on-hamstring | title=West Ham's Victor Moses to undergo scan on hamstring injury | publisher=ESPN | date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, it was revealed that the loan deal also had an option to make the move permanent at the end of the season, but West Ham decided to turn down the option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/10230070/west-ham-to-let-alex-song-victor-moses-and-emmanuel-emenike-leave-8211-sky-sources |title=West Ham to let Alex Song, Victor Moses and Emmanuel Emenike leave – Sky sources |date=4 April 2016 |publisher=SkySports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016–17 season: Return to Chelsea====
[[File:Leicester 0 Chelsea 3 (31510599933).jpg|thumb|right|Moses ''(centre)'' with national teammate ''Wilfred Ndidi'' (right) playing for Chelsea against champions [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], 2017]]
After impressing new manager [[Antonio Conte]] during preseason, Moses was included in the first-team squad. On 15 August 2016, Moses played his first league game for Chelsea in three years, coming off the bench for [[Eden Hazard]] against West Ham United in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37006707 |title=Chelsea 2–1 West Ham: Costa's late strike earns Conte's first Premier League win|date=15 August 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August, Moses made his first start and scored his first goal since his return, in the Second round of the [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]] against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chelsea 3–2 Bristol Rovers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37091061 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After back to back league defeats, Conte converted into a [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]] with Moses playing as a right-sided [[Rightwingback|wing-back]] in the following match against Hull City. His performance as a wing-back helped Chelsea to a 2–0 victory and also earned him the Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37459840 |title=Hull City 0–2 Chelsea |date=1 October 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2016, Moses scored his second league goal of the season against Leicester City in a 3–0 home win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37594219 |title=Chelsea 3–0 Leicester City|date=15 August 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2016, Moses scored the winner in a 2–1 victory against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was named the Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/chelsea-vs-tottenham/356457 |title=Chelsea 2–1 Tottenham Hotspur: Blues maintain hold of top spot| publisher=Sky Sports| date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses played 40 games in all competitions for Chelsea in the 2016–17 season, scoring four goals.&lt;ref name="sb1617" /&gt; With Chelsea winning the Premier League title, Moses became the Nigerian player with the most Premier League appearances for a title winning team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/sports/football/chelseas-victor-moses-is-a-premier-league-winner-id6670904.html|title=Chelsea"s Victor Moses is a Premier League winner|first=Steve|last=Dede|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2017, he played in the [[2017 FA Cup Final]] against Arsenal which Chelsea lost 2–1. Having been booked for a foul on [[Danny Welbeck]] earlier, he was given a second booking, resulting in a red card, after diving in the [[penalty area]]. He became the fifth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2017/05/28/fa-cup-final-victor-moses-joins-four-players-hall-shame/|title=FA Cup final: Victor Moses joins four other players in hall of shame|date=28 May 2017|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–18 season====
Moses scored the opening goal in the [[2017 FA Community Shield]], which Chelsea lost to [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] Arsenal on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal lift Community Shield|date=6 August 2017|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=thefa.com|publisher=The Football Association|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/aug/04/fa-community-shield-arsenal-chelsea-report-060817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Fenerbahçe====
In January 2019, Moses signed an eighteen-month loan deal with Turkish side, Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46984393|title=Victor Moses: Chelsea winger completes Fenerbahce loan|date=25 January 2019|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2019, Moses scored his first league goal of the season for Fenerbahce in a 2-0 win against Goztepe S.K. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legit.ng/1219383-fenerbahce-2-0-goztepe-victor-moses-scores-turkish-league-goal.html|title=Fenerbahçe 2 - 0 Göztepe: Victor Moses scores first Turkish league goal Read more: https://www.legit.ng/1219383-fenerbahce-2-0-goztepe-victor-moses-scores-turkish-league-goal.html|accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===England===
====U16 and U17 level====
Despite originally hailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Moses initially chose to represent his adopted home of [[England national football team|England]], featuring for the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16 team]], in which he won the [[Victory Shield]] in 2005, and [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]] level. He travelled with the squad to the [[2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2007 UEFA European U-17 Championship]] in Belgium, scoring three times (including the only goal in the semi-final win over [[France national under-17 football team|France]]) to help [[John Peacock (footballer)|John Peacock]]'s side to the competition final, where they were narrowly beaten by a single goal by [[Spain national under-17 football team|Spain]], though Moses managed to finish as the competition's top scorer and collect the Golden Boot for doing so.

That same summer, the squad travelled to [[South Korea]] for the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup|FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Moses finished as the Young Lions' top scorer, netting three times in the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup#Group B|Group B fixtures]], but sustained an injury in the victory over [[Brazil national under-17 football team|Brazil]] that ruled him out of the competition. Moses' teammates went on to reach the [[2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup#Quarterfinals|quarterfinal stage]].

====U19s====
Following that tournament, Moses was promoted to the [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] squad, and following his goalscoring exploits for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]'s first-team, he was promoted to the [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] side without appearing sufficiently for the U-18s to actually collect a cap. He went with the U-19s to the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|2008 UEFA European U-19 Championship]] in the [[Czech Republic]], playing two matches and picking up one assist as the Young Lions failed to make it out of [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship#Group B|Group B]]. Speculation grew as manager [[Stuart Pearce]] snubbed him that Moses would return to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]—this move never materialised.

====U21s====
Moses was promoted to the under-21 squad at the beginning of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]] and made his debut against [[Uzbekistan national under-21 football team|Uzbekistan]] in a 2–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvUzbekistan/Teamsheets?p=ts&amp;mid=102750 |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20110402053009/http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/match-centre/2010/EnglandvUzbekistan/Teamsheets?p=ts&amp;mid=102750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2011 |title=Teamsheets |publisher=The Football Association |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses was selected to play for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] in February 2011, but the friendly was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickoff.com/news/19690/shola-ameobi-victor-moses-get-nigeria-call.php Ameobi, Moses get Nigeria call]. kickoff.com. 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He then accepted a call-up in March 2011 for Nigeria's games against [[Ethiopia national football team|Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/9431866.stm |title=Victor Moses gets late Nigeria call |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was ruled out of those games because his application to [[FIFA]] to switch nationalities was not received in time. It was announced on 1 November 2011 that FIFA had cleared both Moses and [[Shola Ameobi]] to play for Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15524642.stm| title = Fifa clears Shola Ameobi, Moses to play for Nigeria| date = 1 November 2011| publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate = 1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was called up to Nigeria's 23-man squad for the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]], scoring two penalties in their final group stage game against Ethiopia, which Nigeria needed to win to go through. For the second, Ethiopian goalkeeper [[Sisay Bancha]] was given his second booking in the events leading to the penalty and was sent off. Ethiopia had already used all three substitutes so their holding midfielder went in goal, and missed Moses' penalty. The game ended 2–0. Nigeria went on to win the tournament, their third such title. Moses started in the final and played the entire game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20970786|title=Nations Cup 2013: Nigeria pick six locally-based players|author=Oluwashina Okeleji|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses was selected for Nigeria's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nigeria/10810433/Nigeria-World-Cup-2014-squad.html&lt;/ref&gt; and started in their opening group match and the Round of 16 match against [[France national football team|France]] as they lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27969976&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon [[Gernot Rohr]]'s assumption as Nigeria's head coach in August 2016, Moses featured regularly in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA 2018 qualifying matches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.espnfc.com/nigeria/story/2984833/premier-league-duo-victor-moses-odion-ighalo-earn-nigeria-recalls| title= Premier League duo Victor Moses, Odion Ighalo earn Nigeria recalls| date =30 October 2016| publisher = ESPN FC | accessdate = 12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses scored a brace for Nigeria during a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA 2018 qualifying match]] against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in November 2016, helping them secure a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/12/chelsea-duo-victor-moses-and-john-obi-mikel-seal-win-for-nigeria-6254332/| title= Chelsea duo Victor Moses and John Obi Mikel seal win for Nigeria| date =12 November 2016| work =Metro|location=UK| accessdate = 12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 he was named in Nigeria’s preliminary 30 man [[Nigeria national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]], where he got a crucial equalizer against Argentina, though, his side lost the game in the dying minutes to see Argentina through while Nigeria got eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb|title=Revealed: Every World Cup 2018 squad - 23-man &amp; preliminary lists &amp; when will they be announced? - Goal.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tournament, it was announced by Moses on 15 August that he has retired from playing for Nigeria at international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45200919|title=Victor Moses: Chelsea's Nigeria winger announces international retirement at 27|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
