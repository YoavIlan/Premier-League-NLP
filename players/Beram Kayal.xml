==Style of play==
Kayal is a [[central midfielder]] but he is capable of performing various different roles within the position. He can play as a [[defensive midfielder]], sitting in front of the back four and stifling the opposition or as a [[box-to-box mid]]fielder, protecting the defenders as well as supporting the forwards. Although he is more renowned for his defensive capabilities than attacking, he is still able to contribute well to going forward.&lt;ref name="STVtransfer" /&gt;

Kayal is a tenacious, hard working midfielder, known for high stamina level, aggressive tackling and combative edge, he also has great passing ability and quick feet.&lt;ref name="STVtransfer"&gt;[http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/189093-kayal-completes-celtic-transfer/ Biram Kayal completes Celtic transfer] STV Sport, 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/12/beram-kayal-celtic-scottish-premier-league Coveted Beram Kayal in no hurry to leave Celtic with treble in sight] guardian.co.uk, 12 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Celtic and [[Israel national football team|Israel]] midfielder [[Eyal Berkovic]], described him as being: "Perfect for British football.
