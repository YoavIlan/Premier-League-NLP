Nasri began his football career playing for local youth clubs in his hometown [[Marseille]]. At age nine, he joined professional club [[Olympique de Marseille]] and spent the next seven years developing in the club's youth academy at [[Centre d'entraînement Robert Louis-Dreyfus|La Commanderie]], the club's training centre. In the [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05 season]], he made his professional debut in September 2004 at age 17 against [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]]. In the [[2005–06 Ligue 1|following season]], he became a regular starter in the team and also participated in [[UEFA|European competition]] for the first time after playing in the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup|2005–06 edition]] of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. In the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 campaign]], Nasri won the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award and was also named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]]. He finished his career with Marseille amassing over 160 appearances. He played in the teams that reached back-to-back [[Coupe de France]] finals in [[2006 Coupe de France Final|2006]] and [[2007 Coupe de France Final|2007]].

In June 2008, Nasri joined [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a four-year contract. He reached prominence with the team in his third season winning the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) Fans' Player of the Month award on three occasions and being named to the association's [[PFA Team of the Year|Team of the Year]]. In December 2010, he was named the [[France Football#French Player of the Year|French Player of the Year]] for his performances during the calendar year.&lt;ref name="nasri_player"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20101213_144746_nasri-numero-1-a-23-ans.html |title=Nasri, numéro 1 à 23 ans |work=[[France Football]] |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2010 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214104656/http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20101213_144746_nasri-numero-1-a-23-ans.html |archivedate=14 December 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, after three seasons with Arsenal, Nasri joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on a four-year contract. In his first season with the club, he won his first major honour as a player as the club won the [[2011–12 Premier League]].

== Personal life ==
Samir Nasri ({{lang-ar|سمير نصري}}) was born in [[Septèmes-les-Vallons]], a northern suburb of [[Marseille]], to French nationals of [[Algeria]]n descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://septemesmonvillage.free.fr/septemois/samir-nasri%20.html|title=Le minot Prodige de Septèmes |publisher=[[Septèmes-les-Vallons]]|date= |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liberation.fr/portrait/0101101885-petit-om-deviendra-grand|title=Petit OM deviendra grand |publisher=[[Septèmes-les-Vallons]]|date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Ouassila Ben Saïd, and father, Abdelhafid Nasri, were both born in France; his father being born and raised in Marseille, while his mother being from nearby [[Salon-de-Provence]].&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/262422/nasri-un-bleu-made-in-om/|title=Nasri, un Bleu "made in OM"  |publisher=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]]|date=2 June 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri's grandparents emigrated to France from Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/samir-nasri-et-tatiana-golovin-si-demain-tatiana-m-apprenait-qu-elle-attend-un-enfant_a50649/1|title=Samir Nasri et Tatiana Golovin: "Si demain Tatiana m'apprenait qu'elle attend un enfant&amp;nbsp;..." |work=Pure People|date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother is a [[housewife]] and his father previously worked as a [[bus driver]] before becoming his son's personal manager. At the start of his football career, Nasri initially played under his mother's surname, Ben Saïd, before switching to Nasri, his father's surname, following his selection to the [[France national under-16 football team|France under-16 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/384113.shtml |title=Samir Nasri fête ses 20 ans |publisher=[[French Football Federation]] |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2012 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the eldest of four children and is a non-practising Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/international/actualites/samir-nasri-je-suis-musulman-non-pratiquant|title=Samir Nasri: "Je suis musulman, non pratiquant"|work=Le Buteur|date=5 March 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308230635/http://www.lebuteur.com/international/actualites/samir-nasri-je-suis-musulman-non-pratiquant|archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri has a younger sister named Sonia and twin brothers named Walid and Malik.&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt; All four were raised in La Gavotte Peyret. After joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in England, Nasri settled in [[Hampstead]], a district of North London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/samir-nasri-gunners-midfielder-is-streets-ahead-1625716.html|title=Samir Nasri: Gunners midfielder is streets ahead |work=The Independent |location=UK|date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
While growing up in La Gavotte Peyret, Nasri grew an attraction to the sport of [[association football|football]] at a young age.&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt; He regularly played the sport on the [[street football|streets]] where he learned many of his skills. Upon noticing his prodigious talent, his parents signed him up to play with the local club in his hometown. Nasri spent one year playing with the club in La Gavotte Peyret before moving to Pennes Mirabeau in nearby [[Les Pennes-Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] at age seven. While playing with Pennes, Nasri was discovered by [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] scout Freddy Assolen, who had been informed of the player's talent through local [[word of mouth]].&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.om.net/en/Saison/101002/Actualites/32981/Samir_Nasri_to_play_his_100th|title=Samir Nasri to play his 100th!|publisher=[[Olympique de Marseille]]|date=10 November 2007|accessdate=18 March 2011|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405021025/http://www.om.net/en/Saison/101002/Actualites/32981/Samir_Nasri_to_play_his_100th|archivedate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After noticing Nasri's skill in person, Assolen recruited the player to travel with a group of other young players to Italy to participate in a youth tournament where they would play against the youth academies of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Nasri impressed at the tournament and Assolen was jokingly told by a Milan scout that "he [Nasri] stays here, you leave him".&lt;ref name="nasri_parents"/&gt; After returning to France, Marseille officials organized a meeting with the player's father and the group agreed to allow Nasri insertion into the club's academy at the age of nine.

=== Olympique de Marseille ===

{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote= "He could do everything with the ball: stepovers, dribbling, shooting with the right or the left. In fact, I wasn't even sure whether he was left or right-footed." |source= &lt;small&gt;Freddy Assolen, upon noticing Nasri's skill at the age of nine.&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; &lt;/small&gt; }}

Upon entering the Marseille youth academy, Nasri quickly impressed. Upon moving to [[Bastide]], where the club's youth players reside, his style of play began to take shape. In 2007, Nasri admitted that the move to Bastide really helped his game, stating, "That's where I really started to progress. Training was different and the facilities are beautiful, all of which helps you work well."&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; As a result of his quick progression, Nasri was an integral part of every youth team he was a part of winning several trophies, such as the Championnat de Provence, Coupe de Provence, and the Ligue de la Méditerranée. After spending most of the 2003–04 season playing with the club's under-18 team, for the latter part of the season, the now 16-year-old Nasri was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth division of [[Football in France|French football]]. He appeared primarily as a substitute in a few matches during the campaign as the reserve team failed to rebound from its bad start to the season, which resulted in a 16th-place finish and relegation to the [[Championnat de France amateur 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20304.htm|title=Olympique Marseille Reserve Pro: Saison Football 2003/2004|work=Stat2Foot|date=|accessdate=18 March 2011|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617131754/http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20304.htm#|archive-date=17 June 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debut season ====
Ahead of the [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05 season]], several clubs were reported to be interested in signing Nasri, most notably English clubs [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_2337629,00.html|title=Gunners join Nasri hunt |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=31 May 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to decrease the speculation, Nasri was offered a three-year professional contract by Marseille officials led by president [[Pape Diouf]] and manager [[José Anigo]]. On 13 August 2004, Nasri agreed to the contract. Marseille officials had been eager to sign Nasri to a contract in an attempt to not undergo a situation similar to the departure of [[Mathieu Flamini]], in which the player departed the club without Marseille receiving any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11669_2323845,00.html|title=L'OM starlet in demand |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=14 January 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his professional contract, Nasri was promoted to the senior team by Anigo and assigned the number 22 shirt. He began the season playing on the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning a call up to the senior team in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20405.htm|title=Olympique Marseille Reserve Pro: Saison Football 2004/2005|work=Stat2Foot|date=|accessdate=22 March 2011|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402031819/http://www.stat2foot.com/mclubs/om20405.htm#|archive-date=2 April 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasri made his professional debut on 12 September in a 2–0 league defeat to [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], appearing as a substitute for [[Bruno Cheyrou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49233|title=Sochaux v. Marseille Match Report|publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |date=12 September 2004 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October, he made his first professional start playing the entire match in a 1–1 draw with [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48917|title=Marseille v. Saint-Étienne Match Report |publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |date=17 October 2004 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri featured heavily within the team under Anigo and later [[Philippe Troussier]]. In the team's first match following the winter break, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 away victory over [[Lille OSC|Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49211|title=Lille v. Marseille Match Report|publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=18 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri finished his rookie campaign with 25 total appearances, one goal and two assists.

==== 2005–06 season ====

[[File:Samir Nasri in Moscow.jpg|200px|upright|thumb|left|Nasri taking a corner during his time with Marseille.]]

The [[2005–06 Ligue 1|2005–06 season]] saw Marseille boosted by the arrival of attackers [[Franck Ribéry]] and [[Djibril Cissé]], the latter arriving after having a successful loan stint with the club the previous season. Nasri, who was now given a more prominent role within the team by new manager [[Jean Fernandez]], formed impressive partnerships with the two along with lead [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Mamadou Niang]].&lt;ref name="nasri_assolen"/&gt; He appeared in 49 total matches, which included appearances in both the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Nasri made his European debut on 16 July 2005 in the first round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]] against Swiss club [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. Marseille won the first leg 3–2.

Similar to his previous three years at Marseille, Nasri began the new season under new management as the club was now being led by the Belgian [[Eric Gerets]].

Initially, Nasri struggled during the infancy of the campaign due to dealing with the effects of a severely sprained ankle suffered in the pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11810_2595419,00.html|title=L'OM relief at Nasri news |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to score a goal or provide an assist in the team's first eight league matches.

Though not explicitly named in the book, Nasri was widely identified as the player in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/outspoken-gallas-loses-captaincy-1029711.html|title=Outspoken Gallas loses captaincy |date=22 November 2008 |work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=19 March 2011 |first=Jason |last=Burt}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of Nasri's disrespectful attitude, Gallas cited an incident in which the young player sat in Thierry Henry's seat on the team bus and refused to move, which, according to Gallas, undermined the striker's seniority. The incident ultimately led to a verbal exchange between Nasri and Gallas during a training session.&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt; In response, Nasri played down the incident, stating Gallas was overreacting to a problem that did not exist.&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt; In 2010, after failing to make the 2010 World Cup squad, Nasri opened up about the situation, stating that during Gallas' final year at Arsenal, Nasri was one of "four or five" Arsenal players who did not speak to the defender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=786779&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5901 | title = Nasri reveals off-field Gallas issues | date = 15 May 2010 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud culminated on 20 November 2010 when Nasri lived up to a pledge he would not shake the hand of Gallas, who was then playing for Tottenham Hotspur, during the pre-match build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1331423/Samir-Nasri-shake-hand-William-Gallas-Spurs-defender-returns-Arsenal.html|title=I won't shake hands!

[[File:Samir Nasri Euro 2012 vs Sweden.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Nasri dribbles past a [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] defender at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].]]

In the 2008–09 season, Nasri appeared in only three matches with the national team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost a year and a half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="nasri_world"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6026938,00.html|title=Nasri fears for WC spot |date=14 March 2010 |publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|accessdate=19 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8676453.stm|title=France keep uncapped pair in trimmed World Cup squad|date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I told myself I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one."&lt;ref name="nasri_interview"/&gt;

Nasri returned to the national team under the reign of new coach [[Laurent Blanc]] for the team's friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] on 11 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/534626.shtml | title = Cabaye forfait, Matuidi en renfort | date = 1 September 2010 | publisher=[[French Football Federation]] | accessdate =19 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed the September call-ups due to injury before returning to the team in October for [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|Euro 2012 qualifying]] matches against Romania and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. On 25 March 2011, Nasri [[List of France national football team captains|captained]] the national team for the first time in its 2–0 Euro qualification win over Luxembourg. He provided the assist on the opening goal scored by [[Philippe Mexès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season=2012/round=15171/match=2002105/index.html|title=France work hard for win in Luxembourg|date=25 March 2011|publisher=[[UEFA]]|accessdate=11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's final Euro qualifier against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Nasri scored the equalizing goal, converting a penalty in a 1–1 draw. The point gained from the stalemate secured a [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] qualifying spot for France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/matches/season=2012/round=15171/match=2002081/postmatch/report/index.html#nasri+sends+france+through|title=Nasri keeps his cool to send France through|date=11 October 2011 |publisher=[[UEFA]]|accessdate=11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Nasri was named to the squad to participate in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/yoann-gourcuff-omitted-as-france-announce-euro-2012-squad-7800136.html|title=Yoann Gourcuff omitted as France announce Euro 2012 squad|date=29 May 2012 |work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's opening group stage match against [[England national football team|England]], he scored the equalizing goal in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18076341|title=France 1 England 1|date=11 June 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After France lost to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the quarter-finals, Nasri subjected a reporter to what was described as a "foul-mouthed tirade" when asked for his views on the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/euro-2012/news/192371-euro-2012-samir-nasri-targets-journalist-in-foul-mouthed-tirade |title=Euro 2012: Samir Nasri targets journalist in foul mouthed tirade |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that and other misdemeanours, the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) imposed a three-match international ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19014674|title=Samir Nasri: France ban Man City midfielder for three games |publisher=BBC Sport |date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2014, France manager [[Didier Deschamps]] revealed his 23-man squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], omitting Nasri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cup 2014: Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy not in France squad|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27401306|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2014, at age 27, Nasri confirmed his decision to retire from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/11023519/Manchester-City-midfielder-Samir-Nasri-quits-international-football-with-France.html|title=Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri quits international football with France|first=Jason|last=Burt |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=10 August 2014|date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style of play ==

[[File:Samir Nasri in Moscow 2.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Nasri attempting a shot in a 2008 UEFA Cup match with Marseille against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].]]

In his early years at Marseille, Nasri was deployed in several positions, most notably as a [[deep-lying midfielder]] and a [[wide midfielder]] primarily on the right side as he was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"&gt;{{cite news|title= Samir Nasri: the new Zidane?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/23/europeanfootball.marseille|date=23 March 2007 |first=Paul|last=Doyle |work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of developing his physical traits, in the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]], manager [[Albert Emon]] inserted Nasri into the [[playmaker]] role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"/&gt; Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a [[central attacking midfielder]] at both club and international level.&lt;ref name="nasri_style"/&gt; The player has personally said that playing centrally is his preference.&lt;ref name="nasri_world"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/9415207.stm | title = Arsenal star Samir Nasri primed for Barcelona challenge  | date = 7 March 2011 |publisher=BBC | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=831364&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5901 | title = Nasri wants to be central figure at Arsenal | date = 11 October 2010 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5813481/5-key-questions-international-friendlies | title = (Not-so-) friendly fire | date = 22 November 2010 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/nasri | title = Wenger – My creative stars are versatile | date = 8 February 2009 | publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His close control with the ball, speed, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]], [[Cross (football)|crossing]], and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former [[Captain (association football)|club captain]] [[Cesc Fàbregas]].

In 2009, in order to accommodate the arrival of Russian attacker Andrey Arshavin, it was recommended by both Wenger and then-France national team coach Raymond Domenech that Nasri revert to his role as a deep-lying midfielder so the player could showcase his underrated defensive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_5283401,00.html | title = Nasri set for defensive role | date = 5 May 2009 | work=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasri is also an underrated direct free kick and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] taker. The player had previously developed a [[superstition]] with regards to taking spot kicks, but conquered the issue after successfully converting two penalties in the team's League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/8017749/Arsenals-Samir-Nasri-dived-for-penalty-in-Carling-Cup-says-Tottenham-manager-Harry-Redknapp.html | title = Arsenal's Samir Nasri dived for penalty in Carling Cup, says Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp | date = 22 September 2010 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate =19 March 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenger describes Nasri as a "young, quick and technically outstanding player".&lt;ref name="nasri_arsenal"/&gt; He is described in a similar fashion by club scout [[Gilles Grimandi]], who stated that Nasri is "a fantastic athlete, he's quick, flexible and good with his feet".&lt;ref name="nasri_scout"/&gt; Nasri's playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref name="nasri_zidane"/&gt; After joining Arsenal and excelling on the wing, the English media began comparing him to former club player and compatriot [[Robert Pires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/3407741/Arsene-Wenger-finds-his-new-Robert-Pires-in-dazzling-Samir-Nasri-Football.html | title = Arsene Wenger finds his new Robert Pires in dazzling Samir Nasri | date = 8 November 2008 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate =19 March 2011 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Barclay}}&lt;/ref&gt;
