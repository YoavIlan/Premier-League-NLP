== Club career ==

=== Leicester City ===
A product of the [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] [[Youth system|youth academy]], Schlupp was given a [[squad number]], 31, for the first time for the [[2010–11 Leicester City F.C. season|2010–11]] season along with fellow academy players [[Tom Parkes]] and Jorrin John by then manager [[Paulo Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2104744,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731085703/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2104744%2C00.html |archivedate=31 July 2010 |title=City Finalise Squad Numbers |work=Leicester City F.C |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlupp signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2013 on 14 March 2011.&lt;ref name="bring-in"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brentford/9424865.stm|title=Brentford bring in Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp|work=BBC Sport|date=14 March 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlupp was named amongst the Leicester City substitutes for the first time by, then manager, [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] in the 3–2 home defeat to Norwich City on 8 March 2011.

==== Loan to Brentford ====
Schlupp joined [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on a one-month [[loan (sports)|loan]] on 14 March 2011, declining a call up to the [[Germany national youth football team|Germany Under-19]] squad in order to complete the move.&lt;ref name="bring-in"/&gt; He made his senior debut in a 1–0 defeat to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] coming on as a substitute on 77 minutes on 15 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9422282.stm|title=Brentford 0 – 1 Huddersfield|work=BBC Sport|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his first full senior appearance in his career he scored two goals winning the match against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 2–1 on 25 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9429110.stm|title=Brentford 2 – 1 Carlisle|work=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlupp earned a start in Brentford's next match and proved himself once more by scoring a header from a [[Lewis Grabban]] cross against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/9436379.stm|title=Sheff Wed 1 – 3 Brentford|work=BBC Sport|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April Schlupp started in the [[2011 Football League Trophy Final]], playing the full 90 minutes. Schlupp hit the post with an effort on goal. Carlisle United won the match 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9443308.stm|title=Brentford 0 – 1 Carlisle|work=BBC Sport|date=3 April 2011|accessdate=3 April 2011|first=Stephan|last=Shemilt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April the loan deal was extended to the end of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13087409.stm|title=Brentford to keep Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp|work=BBC Sport|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Leicester City ===

==== 2011–12 season ====
[[File:Schlupp 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Schlupp playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2011]]
On returning to Leicester, Schlupp travelled with the squad on their tour to Sweden often playing in friendlies as a left-back. He was given the squad number 27 for the [[2011–12 Leicester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]].&lt;ref name="LCFC – Jeff Schlupp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2407882,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422033851/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2407882%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2012 |title=2011/12 Squad Numbers Confirmed |work=Leicester City F.C |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first competitive senior appearance for the club he scored a hat-trick against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] first round on 9 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10274~59922,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313103430/http://www.lcfc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10274~59922%2C00.html |archivedate=13 March 2012 |title=Rotherham vs Leicester City |work=Leicester City F.C |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14475843.stm|title=Eriksson praises Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp|work=BBC Sport|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut in a 2–0 defeat to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 13 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester 0 – 2 Reading|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14429624.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored his first league goal in a 4–0 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 1 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leicester 4 – 0 Derby|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/15045690.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlupp scored his second league goal, and Leicester City's 4,000th home league goal, against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the 80th minute of 13 March 2012 [[Football League Championship|Championship]] clash. Schlupp ended his first season in the Leicester first team, scoring six times in 26 games in all competitions.

==== 2012–13 season ====
Schlupp spent a week in January 2013 training with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11712/8406224/Manchester-United-have-taken-Leicester-City-s-Jefferey-Schlupp-on-trial | title=Manchester United have taken Leicester City's Jefferey Schlupp on trial | work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trial was extended into a second and third week into the beginning of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/21368222|title=Jeffrey Schlupp: Nigel Pearson coy about Man Utd 'move'|work=BBC Sport|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Manchester United he played two under-21 games, a game against Liverpool and then a game against West Ham at Upton Park.

Upon Schlupp's return to Leicester he found his way into the Leicester team both at left back and in attack, scoring three goals towards the latter part of the [[2012–13 Football League Championship|2012–13]] season. Schlupp scored key goals in back to back home games against Birmingham City and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

==== 2013–14 season ====
Schlupp opened his goalscoring account for the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14]] season, rounding off a 3–1 away win to against Millwall on New Year's Day 2014 with smart finish through the goalkeeper's legs on his weaker foot. Following regular left-back [[Paul Konchesky]] receiving a three-match suspension for a red card against East Midlands rivals [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], Schlupp found greater opportunities at the back of the Leicester side, putting in highly rated performances against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

==== 2014–15 season ====
On 16 August 2014, Schlupp made his [[Premier League]] debut as a second-half substitute against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the opening weekend of the season. On 4 October, Schlupp scored his first Premier League goal, in the 2–2 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Schlupp scored his second goal of the season on 29 November, in the 2–3 defeat against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] before adding his third in the 2–2 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/29/england/premier-league/queens-park-rangers-fc/leicester-city-fc/1703741/|title=QUEENS PARK RANGERS VS.

|work=Soccerway|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2015, Schlupp's fine first season in the Premier League was met with reward as he was named Leicester City's Young Player of the Year, as voted by the fans, as well as winning the Players' Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esteban Cambiasso Named Leicester City Player of the Year|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/esteban-cambiasso-named-leicester-city-player-of-the-year-2461984.aspx|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Leicester City|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2015–16 season ====

Schlupp started as the left back during Leicester's flying start to the season, although he later moved into a midfield role as the season progressed. Schlupp scored his first goal of the season in the 2–1 away victory against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34366647|title=Norwich City 1 – Leicester City 2|work=BBC Sport|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ruled out for six weeks in December with a hamstring injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11712/10102756/leicester-have-been-hit-by-jeff-schlupps-hamstring-injury|title=Leicester hit by Jeff Schlupp's hamstring injury|work=Sky Sports|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from the injury Schlupp had a strong impact on Leicester City's season, and contributed hugely to Leicester's unlikely title triumph. As a result of his successful season Schlupp was named Leicester's Young Player of the Year for the second year running beating [[Demarai Gray]] and [[Ben Chilwell]] to the award.&lt;ref name=Leicester&gt;{{cite web|title=Riyad Mahrez Named Leicester City Player of the Season|url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/riyad-mahrez-named-leicester-city-player-of-the-season-3107732.aspx|work=Leicester City|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
