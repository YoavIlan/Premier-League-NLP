'''Alvin Edward Martin''' (born 29 July 1958) is an English retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].

Playing most of his footballing career for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] he appeared in 598 games for them, scoring 34 goals. With the club for 21 years, and winning the [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980 FA Cup]] Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] before moving into football management with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. This lasted  two seasons before he started a career in the media on radio station [[talksport|talkSPORT]] and also as a [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] on [[Sky Sports]] TV football talk shows.
Playing 17 times for [[England national football team|England]] during the 1980s, Martin represented them at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Walton, Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], Martin played schools football for Bootle and Lancashire and was attached to [[Merseyside]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as a schoolboy, but left in 1974 after the [[Goodison Park]] club only offered him an apprenticeship on a part-time basis. An unsuccessful trial later that summer with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] was followed the very next day by one for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], where he was awarded a contract as an apprentice 19 August 1974.&lt;ref&gt;West Ham handbooks 1986-87 and 1988/90&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in the FA Youth cup final of 1975 and signed as a professional on 29 July 1976. He did not make his first team debut until 18 March 1978 as a substitute against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. His final appearance was as an 88th-minute substitute on 5 May 1996 against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

Martin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], in which he became one of only two players, along with [[Billy Bonds]], to be awarded two [[Testimonial match|testimonials]].&lt;ref name="SCOUSER"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/scouser-martins-heart-with-the-hammers--at-a-stretch-477140.html|title=Scouser Martin's heart with the Hammers – at a stretch|first=Ronald|last=Atkin|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=7 May 2006|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] on 21 August 1988 and the second against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 11 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Handbooks 1988/89 and 1996/97&lt;/ref&gt; It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Martin — nicknamed 'Stretch'&lt;ref name="SCOUSER"/&gt; — enjoyed his most rewarding years, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] winners medals in successive seasons, [[1979–80 FA Cup|1980]] and 1981.

Martin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a [[hat-trick]] against three different [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]s — [[Martin Thomas (footballer born 1959)|Martin Thomas]], who was then injured, and outfield players [[Chris Hedworth]] and [[Peter Beardsley]] — in a [[Football League First Division]] match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8–1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as it [[1985–86 Football League|finished third in the top level]], just four points behind champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3485602.stm|title=The hat-trick Hall of Fame|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|first=Phil|last=McNulty|date=25 February 2004|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals.

Martin remained loyal to West Ham despite their [[1988–89 Football League|relegation from the top flight in 1989]], and helped them gain promotion two years later. The club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the [[Premier League]] before finally departing at the end of the [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96 season]] after 21 years service, aged 37.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=434&amp;united=Alvin_Martin Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Alvin Martin]&lt;/ref&gt;
After leaving West Ham, Martin had a brief spell with [[East End of London|East London]] neighbours [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], before managing [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] for two years, during which the club was relegated to the [[Football League One|League One]].

==International career==
Martin was given his first [[England national football team|England]] [[Cap (sport)|cap]] by [[Ron Greenwood]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in May 1981. Injury ruled him out of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] finals in Spain, but he was playing some of the finest football of his career when the next manager, [[Bobby Robson]], included him in his squad for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 edition in Mexico]]: he played in the victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/r2_eng_v_par.html|title=England - Paraguay 3-0 (1-0)|publisher=Planet World Cup|date=18 June 1986|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, replacing the suspended [[Terry Fenwick]], but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s infamous [[Hand of God goal|'Hand of God']]; in total, he made 17 international appearances.

==Career after football==
After retiring from management, he joined national radio station [[talksport|talkSPORT]], while also being a regular pundit on [[Sky Sports]] TV football talk shows.

==Personal life==
Martin's sons, [[David Martin (footballer, born 1986)|David]] and [[Joe Martin (footballer)|Joe]], are also footballers. The former is a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], whilst the latter is a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].
