'''Alan Ernest Devonshire''' (born 13 April 1956) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who is the current manager of [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]]. He was a wide [[midfielder]] who played for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], with whom he won the [[FA Cup]] in 1980, and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he finished his career in 1992. Devonshire won eight caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1980 and 1983. He subsequently became a manager with Maidenhead United, [[Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C.|Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough]] and [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]].

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Park Royal]], then a part of [[Middlesex]], Devonshire had been a schoolboy footballer but had been turned away by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at age 14 for being too small.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}} He returned to [[Selhurst Park]] two years later and played a couple of youth team games but was again released by the club, this time by former West Ham player and Palace manager, [[Malcolm Allison]]. Devonshire started playing for non-league [[Southall F.C.|Southall]] and in doing so came to the attention of [[Football League|league]] clubs such as [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}} By day he worked as a fork-lift truck driver at the [[Hoover Building|Hoover Factory]] in [[Perivale]], Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United [[Scout (sport)|scout]]s, [[Eddie Baily]] and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, [[Ron Greenwood]]. Devonshire signed for West Ham United in 1976 for a fee of £5,000, a transfer which has led to him being referred to as "West Ham's best ever buy".{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

===West Ham United===
Devonshire made his debut for West Ham on 27 October 1976 in a League Cup tie against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], in which West Ham lost 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3002&amp;united=27_Oct_1976 |title=Game played on 27 Oct 1976 |publisher=Westhamstats.info |date=27 October 1976 |accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his League debut three days later on 30 October 1976 against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], where he played in a 3–0 defeat.  He soon became a fans' favourite, who referred to him by his nickname "Dev". His workman-like attitude was one to which the fans could relate. He also enhanced his rapport with supporters by travelling to home game on the [[London Underground]] from his West London home.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

He played 29 games in all competitions, without scoring, in his first season, the [[1976-77 in English football|1976–77]] season. It was a poor season for West Ham who finished only two points above a relegation place in 17th place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].&lt;ref name="WHU7677"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1977&amp;united=1st_Division_1976-77 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1st Division 1976–77 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the [[1977-78 in English football|1977–78]] season saw Devonshire's first goals for the club, in a 3–3 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] on 12 November 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3051&amp;united=12_Nov_1977 | title=Game played 12 November 1977 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also saw him play 38 games in all competitions, scoring three goals. Unfortunately for West Ham his efforts could not prevent them from relegation to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after they finished in 20th place.&lt;ref name="WHU197778"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1978&amp;united=1st_Division_1977-78 | title= Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1st Division | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1978-79 in English football|1978–79]] season saw West Ham rebuilding their side following relegation. Devonshire was a regular member of the side which finished 5th in the Second Division. He had played 41 of a possible 42 league games that season and was voted [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Season|Hammer of the Season]].&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHU7879"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1979&amp;united=2nd_Division_1978-79 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics 1978–79 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham failed to gain promotion again in the [[1979-80 in English football|1979–80 season]]. They did however reach the [[1980 FA Cup Final]] where Devonshire collected an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal as West Ham beat favourites, holders and Cup Winners Cup finalists [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] with a single goal from [[Trevor Brooking]] from a cross by Devonshire. He had also scored a goal in a semi-final replay at [[Elland Road]] in a 2–1 win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref name="efcsemi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3176&amp;united=16_Apr_1980 | title=Game played on 16 Apr 1980 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1980shock"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8435400.stm | title=When the Hammers shocked Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 January 2010 | accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=54}}

In the [[1980-81 in English football|1980–81 season]] Devonshire's career flourished. His partnership with Trevor Brooking formed the cornerstone of West Ham's push for promotion back to the First Division. He also played in [[West Ham United F.C. in European football|European football]] for the first time and was a member of the side which reached to [[1981 Football League Cup Final|1981 League Cup Final]]. He collected a Second Division title medal as they won promotion, losing only four games.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=55}} Devonshire continued to be a regular member of the West Ham side in the First Division until a game on 7 January 1984. Playing against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the FA Cup, he snapped three [[ligament]]s in his right knee. He tried to make a comeback in March 1985 in two cup games against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] but again broke down. It was 19 months from his first injury to his full return, in a game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 17 August 1985.&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=186&amp;united=Alan_Devonshire | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Alan Devonshire | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His long spell out injured had resulted in him losing some of his pace but still maintaining his ability to pass the ball well. He made the [[Assist (football)|final pass]] for many of the goals scored by teammates, [[Tony Cottee]] and [[Frank McAvennie]] in the [[1985-86 in English football|1985–86 season]] as West Ham finished third in the First Division.&lt;ref name="WHU8586"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1986&amp;united=1st_Division_1985-86 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics – 1st Division 1985–86 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury struck Devonshire again in the first game of the [[1987-88 in English football|1987–88]] season. Just 15 minutes in a game against Queens Park Rangers, he snapped his [[Achilles tendon]]. This forced him out of the game for over a year and by the time of his return the West Ham team were in decline. The [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]] season saw him play only 20 league game without scoring as West Ham were relegated back to the Second Division.&lt;ref name="WHU8889"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1989&amp;united=1st_Division_1988-89 | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics – 1st Division 1988–89 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1989-90 in English football|1989–90]] season manager [[John Lyall]] was replaced by [[Lou Macari]] who undertook the rebuilding of the West Ham side. Devonshire was rarely used making only seven league appearances that season. Macari was replaced in the same season by [[Billy Bonds]] who granted Devonshire a free transfer in May 1990.{{sfn|Hogg|1995|p=55}} His last appearance for West Ham came on 14 February 1990 when he was a substitute for [[Gary Strodder]] in a 6–0 away defeat to [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in a League Cup semi-final. His performance, and that of other experienced West Ham players, [[Liam Brady]], [[Phil Parkes (footballer, born 1950)|Phil Parkes]], [[Alvin Martin]] and [[Julian Dicks]], was described as "embarrassingly helpless" in a game known as the "St. Valentine's Day massacre".{{sfn|Blows|2000|p=174}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/15/joy-of-six-league-cup-semi-finals | title=The Joy of Six: League Cup semi-finals | work=The Guardian | date=15 January 2010 | accessdate=26 December 2013 | author=Smyth, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3684&amp;united=14_Feb_1990 | title=Game played on 14 Feb 1990 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devonshire had played 448 competitive games over 14 years, scoring 32 goals.&lt;ref name="Alan Devonshire WHU stats"/&gt;

===Watford===
In 1990 Devonshire signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he played for two years before dropping out of league football in 1992.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watfordfcarchive.com/downloads/players/+Cullip-Dickson.pdf |title=Watford Football Club archive 1881–2017 » Players – Cullip to Dickson |page=36 |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve non-league club Chippenham Sports as a player-coach.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive" /&gt;

==International career==
Devonshire was selected to play for [[England national football team|England]] by his former manager at West Ham, Ron Greenwood. He made his debut on 20 May 1980 in a 1–1 draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="englandint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=309 |title=Alan Devonshire England |publisher=www.englandfc.com |accessdate=26 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212811/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=309 |archivedate=4 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood selected him again on 31 May 1980 in a friendly game against [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], which England won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=England | url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/alan-devonshire-4684/biography-1980-83_a11309/ | publisher=www.sportingheroes.net | accessdate=26 December 2013 | author=Rudd, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Devonshire his position and style of play were also those of [[Glenn Hoddle]] who was preferred as an international selection. He would have to wait two years for his next cap, on 25 May 1982 in a 2–0 win against [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Another game followed on 2 June 1982, a 1–1 draw against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Both of these games were warm-up games before the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]]. Devonshire was omitted from the final squad for the tournament. New England manager, [[Bobby Robson]] attempting to rebuild an aging England team, selected Devonshire in October 1982. The game, against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] finished 2–1 to the Germans in a bad defeat for England.&lt;ref name=englandint/&gt; His final two appearances, against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] came towards the end of 1983 and were Devonshire's only appearances in competitive international games, the games being qualifiers for the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/luxembourg-v-england-16-november-1983-238156/ | title=Luxemburg v England 16 November 1983 | publisher=www.11v11.com | accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management career==
Devonshire began his management career as manager of non-league club Osterley and Brentford Women.&lt;ref name="watfordfcarchive" /&gt; He then became the manager of [[Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough F.C.|Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough]] in the [[Conference South]]. He was previously manager of [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]].

As manager of Hampton &amp; Richmond, he took the club from [[Isthmian League Division One South]] to the play-off-final of the Conference South. In his first season, he guided them to fifth place in the Isthmian Division One South which due to re-organization of the leagues was enough to see the club promoted to the [[Isthmian League Premier Division]]. He then guided the club to a sixth-placed finish in their debut season at that level missing out on the play-offs on goal difference on the final day of the season. The 2005–06 season would see Devonshire take the team into the play-offs. Having won a dramatic play-off semi-final on penalties away to [[Heybridge Swifts F.C.|Heybridge Swifts]] the team then faced [[Fisher Athletic F.C.|Fisher Athletic]] away who beat Hampton 3–0. Devonshire finally managed to get Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough promoted the following season in style by bringing the Isthmian Premier Division title to the Beveree. In their debut season in the Conference South he has managed to guide his team to third place in the league and into the play-offs for the [[Conference National]].

On 23 May 2011, Devonshire was appointed the manager of newly promoted Conference National club [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]].&lt;ref name="Devonshire looking forward to Iron challenge"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/sport/9043708.Devonshire_looking_forward_to_Iron_challenge/ | title = Devonshire looking forward to Iron challenge | publisher = ''Braintree &amp; Witham Times'' | first = Jonathan | last = Waldon | date = 23 May 2011 | accessdate = 23 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having declined the offer of a new contract, Devonshire left the club on 17 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/sport/localsport/12896091._/ | title=Alan Devonshire departs as Braintree Town manager | work=www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk | date=17 April 2015 | accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed manager of one of his former clubs, [[National League South]] side Maidenhead United, on 5 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Graeme |last=Copas |url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/Sport/Football/Maidenhead-Utd-FC/Alan-Devonshire-has-been-appointed-Maidenhead-United-manager-05052015.htm/ |title=Alan Devonshire has been appointed Maidenhead United manager |newspaper=Maidenhead Advertiser |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606122121/http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/Sport/Football/Maidenhead-Utd-FC/Alan-Devonshire-has-been-appointed-Maidenhead-United-manager-05052015.htm |archivedate=6 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
