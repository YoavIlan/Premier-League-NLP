'''Moussa Sissoko''' (born 16 August 1989) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He plays as a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box midfielder]] in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre of the pitch]], and is capable of playing in either a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|holding midfield role]], or even as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]].

Sissoko began his football career playing for local youth clubs in the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]], such as Espérance Aulnay and [[Red Star F.C.|AS Red Star 93]]. In 2002, he moved south to join professional club [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. Sissoko spent four years in the club's youth academy and made his professional debut in the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]]. He also played in the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time. In the following season, Sissoko earned award nominations for his performances and also helped Toulouse qualify for the newly created [[UEFA Europa League]].

Sissoko was a [[France national youth football team|French youth international]] and played at all levels he was eligible for. In August 2009, he was called up to the [[France national football team|senior team]] for the first time and made his senior international debut in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/matches/round=250471/match=300041092/report.html | title = France v. Faroe Islands Match Report | date = 10 October 2009 | accessdate = 5 June 2010 | publisher = [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first international start four days later in a qualifier against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

==Early life and career==

Sissoko was born in [[Le Blanc-Mesnil]], Seine-Saint-Denis, to [[Mali]]an parents. His father is a [[construction worker]] and his mother is a [[housewife]].&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2010/12/24/976615-Moussa-Sissoko-le-grand-Bleu.html | title = Moussa Sissoko, le grand Bleu | date = 24 December 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = La Depeche | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko is the eldest of four children, with three younger sisters. He was attracted to football at a very young age, stating, "I quickly realised that football could lead me to have a better life".&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"/&gt; At the age of six, Sissoko joined the youth academy of Espérance Aulnay, based in nearby [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]], a suburb in northeastern Paris. He trained three times a week at the club under the supervision of trainer Adama Dieye, who now serves as a correspondent for the club's [[futsal]] team. Sissoko describes Dieye as an important mentor in his development stating "I am here today because of him".&lt;ref name="sissoko_youth"/&gt; In July 1999, Sissoko moved to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] to join [[Red Star F.C.|AS Red Star 93]]. Sissoko spent two years at the club and was teammates with [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] [[midfielder]] [[Yannis Salibur]]. In September 2001, he returned to Aulnay for a further two years developing before seeking a move to a professional club.

==Club career==
===Toulouse===
====2003–2008====
In July 2003, Sissoko made the trek down south to the [[Haute-Garonne]] [[Departments of France|department]] to sign with professional club [[Toulouse FC]]. He signed an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract and was placed in the club's under-14 team. Sissoko spent three years developing in the club's youth academy alongside future teammates [[Cheikh M'Bengue]] and [[Étienne Capoue]] before earning a call up to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of [[Football in France|French football]], ahead of the [[2006–07 Ligue 1|2006–07 season]]. Sissoko appeared in 18 matches during the amateur season, quickly becoming one of the club's most sought after prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.stat2foot.com/twclubs/tfc20607.htm | title = Football Toulouse Effectif CFA 2006/2007 | date =  | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = Stat 2 Foot | language = French | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132608/http://www.stat2foot.com/twclubs/tfc20607.htm | archive-date = 16 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to signing his professional contract with Toulouse, he garnered interest from English clubs [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name ="interview_sissoko" /&gt;

Midway through the 2006–07 season, Sissoko signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Toulouse until June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=15909 | title = Je veux d’abord faire mes preuves en France | date = 25 January 2007 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = Mali Web | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently promoted to the club's senior team in the ensuing summer and assigned the number 22 shirt by manager [[Elie Baup]]. Sissoko made his professional debut on 4 August 2007, appearing as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat to [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51306 | title = Valenciennes v.

Sissoko replaced [[Albin Ebondo]] in the 83rd minute and received a yellow card in the final minute. Toulouse lost the first leg 1–0 and the tie 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301269/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120708025812/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301269/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 8 July 2012 | title = Liverpool spoil Toulouse's big day | date = 15 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301285/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120715154854/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2008/round=15104/match=301285/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 15 July 2012 | title = Liverpool complete safe passage | date = 28 August 2007 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko scored his first professional goal on 1 September 2007 in a 2–0 victory over [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], scoring in [[injury time]] after coming on as a substitute two minutes previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51357 | title = Toulouse v.

On 6 January 2008, Sissoko scored his second goal of the season against [[Paris FC|Paris]] in the [[Coupe de France]]. Toulouse surprisingly lost the match to the semi-professional club 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/52163 | title = Toulouse v.

Following the season, on 25 July 2008, Sissoko signed a contract extension with the club until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.toulouse7.com/2008/07/25/foot-emana-part-au-betis-seville-sissoko-prolonge/ | title = Emana part au Betis Seville, Sissoko prolonge | date = 25 July 2008 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = Toulouse 7 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008–2013====
[[File:Moussa Sissoko 2008-10-04.jpg|thumb|right|Sissoko in [[Toulouse FC]] colours, 2008]]
Following the departure of Emana to Spain, Casanova put Sissoko into the box-to-box midfielder role ahead of the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]] to accommodate emerging defensive midfielder [[Étienne Capoue]] into the starting lineup, as well as [[Étienne Didot]], who arrived from [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. The move allowed Sissoko to retain his defensive duties, but also showcase his attacking skills. He began the season featuring primarily as a substitute under Casanova, but by December, Sissoko had become a regular in the starting eleven. On 24 January 2009, he scored his first goal of the season against amateur [[Alsace|Alsatian]] club FCE Schirrhein in an 8–0 thrashing in the Coupe de France. It was a memorable goal with Sissoko running nearly the entire pitch with the ball at his feet, eluding several Schirrhein players, before finishing at the six-yard box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doOaGiQrM00 | title = but de sissoko TFC Toulouse | date =  | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/autresCompetitions/coupeFrance/feuille_match/53073 | title = Schirrhein v.

He scored his first goal of the league campaign on 7 February in a 2–0 victory over [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/52428 | title = Toulouse v.

For his efforts, he was nominated for the [[2008-09 Ligue 1#Young Player of the Year|UNFP Young Player of the Year]], along with teammate Capoue who also had an outstanding season.

Prior to the start of the [[2009–10 in French football|2009–10 season]], Sissoko drew strong interest from [[Premier League]] outfit [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. The English club reportedly offered as much as [[British pound|£]]12 million for the player and subsequently increased its offer to £15.5 million before president [[Olivier Sadran]] declared that Sissoko would not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Tottenham-have-12m-bid-for-Toulouse-midfielder-Moussa-Sissoko-rejected-article100783.html | title = Tottenham have £12m bid for Toulouse midfielder Moussa Sissoko rejected | date = 6 August 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.extrafootie.co.uk/clubs/detailed/tottenham-hotspur/23577/ | title = Spurs to lodge new Sissoko bid | date = 12 August 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = Extra Footie | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091212060854/http://www.extrafootie.co.uk/clubs/detailed/tottenham-hotspur/23577/ | archive-date = 12 December 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Sadran's comments, fellow Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as Italian clubs [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] were also linked with Sissoko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1228595/Tottenham-Hotspur-set-miss-Moussa-Sissoko-Manchester-City-Bayern-Munich-lead-big-spenders-eyeing-France-star.html | title = Tottenham set to miss out on Moussa Sissoko as Manchester City and Bayern Munich lead big spenders eyeing the France star | date = 17 November 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[Daily Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; To quash the rumours, Sadran announced that Sissoko would not leave the club for anything less than €30 million.

With the [[France national under-17 football team|under-17 team]], Sissoko's playing time increased as France attempted to qualify for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]]. He made his debut as a substitute on 2 November 2005 in the team's opening competitive match against [[England national under-17 football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/264731.shtml | title = La France et l'Angleterre se neutralisent (2–2) | date = 2 November 2005 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2006, Sissoko scored his first youth international goal in the team's second group stage match of the [[Algarve Cup]] against the [[Netherlands national under-17 football team|Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fff.fr///selections/m17ans/287136.shtml | title = France et Pays-Bas dos à dos (1–1) | date = 26 February 2006 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's next group stage match against [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal]], Sissoko scored again in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fff.fr/selections/m17ans/287471.shtml | title = La France remporte le tournoi | date = 28 February 2006 | accessdate = 18 February 2011 | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UEFA]] competition, Sissoko and the team, composed of players such as [[David N'Gog]], [[Gabriel Obertan]], [[Adel Taarabt]], and [[Grégory Sertic]], failed to qualify for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship]], due to their second-place finish in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite round|Elite Round]] portion of the competition.

The team's ultimate failure to qualify for the competition effectively ended Sissoko's under-21 career, though he still appeared in friendly matches against [[Turkey national under-21 football team|Turkey]], [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark]], and [[Russia national under-21 football team|Russia]] in 2010 as he was still eligible to participate in non-competitive matches.

On 3 August 2009, Sissoko earned his first call up to the [[France national football team|senior team]] for a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tfc.info/news/node/1013376 | title = Gignac et Sissoko chez les Bleus | date = 3 August 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[Toulouse FC]] | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sissoko did not make his debut in the match. On 6 October, he was named to the senior squad for the second time for the team's final World Cup qualification matches against the Faroe Islands and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Sissoko earned his first [[Cap (association football)|cap]] in the match against the Faroe Islands appearing as a substitute for [[Jérémy Toulalan]] in the second half. France won the match 5–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=301831/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120708095506/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=301831/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 8 July 2012 | title = Five-goal France cruise into play-offs | date = 10 October 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With France's spot in the play-offs already secured, Sissoko made his first career start in the match against Austria, which France won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=301830/index.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120718210919/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/worldcup/fixturesresults/round=15218/match=301830/index.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 18 July 2012 | title = France finish with a flourish | date = 14 October 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idINIndia-43167520091015 | title = France warm up for playoffs with 3–1 Austria win | date = 14 October 2009 | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | publisher = [[Toulouse FC]] | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite appearing regularly in the squad under [[Raymond Domenech]] in the 2009–10 season, Sissoko failed to make the squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

Sissoko was involved in France's run to the final of the [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016 UEFA European Championship]], making four starts in the tournament. He put in an inspired performance in the final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], having two shots saved in the 1–0 extra time defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/round=2000451/match=2017907/postmatch/report/index.html#portugal+beat+france+final |title=Portugal spoil France's party with extra-time win |work=UEFA |first=Tom |last=Kell |date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
