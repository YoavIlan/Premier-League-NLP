'''Stuart Antony Alan O'Keefe''' (born 4 March 1991) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].

He began his career with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], spending six years in the club's youth academy system, but was released as a teenager without making an appearance for the first team. Following his release, O'Keefe joined the academy at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], making his first-team debut for the club in 2008, during a [[EFL League One|League One]] match, at the age of 17. In 2010, he completed a move to Championship club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a free transfer and went on to make over 50 appearances in all competitions for the club during a five-year spell, helping the club gain promotion to the Premier League via the [[2013 Football League Championship play-off Final|2013 Championship play-off Final]], also spending a brief period on loan at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in late 2014. In January 2015, he moved to Cardiff City for an undisclosed fee.

==Early life==
O'Keefe was born in [[Eye, Suffolk|Eye]], Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hugman|24820|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the village of [[Gislingham]], Suffolk and attended Gislingham Primary School and later [[Hartismere School]].&lt;ref name="footballlife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/feature-football-life-lives-up-to-the-dream-1-434992 |title=Feature: Football life lives up to the dream |newspaper=Diss Express |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030000141/http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/feature-football-life-lives-up-to-the-dream-1-434992 |archive-date=30 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"&gt;{{cite news

==Career==
===Youth===
Having attracted the attention of scouts from several clubs whilst playing for local youth team Scole Lads, O'Keefe was invited to train with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s under-nine team. However, he later signed a youth deal with their [[East Anglian derby|East Anglian]] rivals [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], joining the club at the age of nine and playing alongside [[Jordan Rhodes]] and [[Ed Upson]] in the academy during his time at the club.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; However, he failed to make an appearance for the first team and was released at the end of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]] after Ipswich decided against offering him a scholarship,&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt; believing that he would be unable to compete physically at under-18 level.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; O'Keefe later commented on his release "It was disappointing to be released by Ipswich, especially since I had been there from such a young age, but I always kept believing in myself".&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt;

Following his release, O'Keefe spent one month on trial at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and impressed the club's coaching staff, including youth coach [[Gordon Cowans]],&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; but was forced to leave the club, who were only willing to offer him a one-year youth contract,&lt;ref name="Showdown"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/4724131.O_Keefe_set_for_Gills_showdown/ |title=O'Keefe set for Gills showdown |newspaper=Southend Echo |first=Chris |last=Phillips |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after struggling to travel to the Midlands-based club on a regular basis as he continued to prepare for his GCSEs. He was also offered a trial with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],&lt;ref name="Prideofanglia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=playerProfile&amp;fullname=Stuart%20OKeefe |title=Stuart O'Keefe |publisher=Pride of Anglia |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring during a friendly match for the club but O'Keefe again moved on after Forest stalled over offering him a contract as they were only willing to offer him a one-year youth deal.&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Showdown"/&gt;

===Southend United===
O'Keefe attended a trial with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in November 2007 at the age of 16, having been recommended to the club by a scout working for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and was offered a two-year scholarship just days after arriving at the club.&lt;ref name="footballlife"/&gt; In his first season with the academy, O'Keefe was part of the Southend team that reached the quarter-final of the [[FA Youth Cup]] and also featured for the reserves on several occasions.&lt;ref name="Ex-Town teen to face Chelsea in FA Cup"/&gt; O'Keefe made his first-team debut for Southend on 18 November 2008, at home to [[A.F.C. Telford United]] in a 2–0 win in the [[FA Cup]] first-round replay as a late substitute in place of [[Alan McCormack]],&lt;ref name="Southend 2-0 AFC Telford"&gt;{{cite news

The following week, after one further substitute appearance, O'Keefe was handed his first league start for Southend by manager [[Steve Tilson]] against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[Elland Road]] on 27 January 2009. However, this proved to be his last appearance for the club during the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref name="sb0809"/&gt; Despite this, O'Keefe was nominated for the League One Apprentice of the Year award,&lt;ref name="apprentice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/4099290.O_Keefe_shortlisted_for_awards/ |title=O'Keefe shortlisted for awards |newspaper=Southend Echo |first=Chris |last=Phillips |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually losing out to [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] defender [[Tom Aldred]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/8401599.stm |title=Carlisle defender Tom Aldred tipped by Workington boss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, O'Keefe featured more regularly for the first team, making nine appearances in total despite missing two months of the season due to a hernia injury sustained in a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 26 January 2010.&lt;ref name="Southendreturn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southend_utd/8573138.stm |title=

===Crystal Palace===
On 18 August 2010, O'Keefe signed for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on an initial one-year contract after impressing manager [[George Burley]] in a trial match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] reserves, having been recommended to Burley by his assistant manager  [[Dougie Freedman]] who had played alongside O'Keefe at Southend.&lt;ref name="Disseagles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/o-keefe-signs-for-eagles-1-813819 |title=O'Keefe signs for Eagles |newspaper=Diss Express |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103233834/http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/o-keefe-signs-for-eagles-1-813819 |archive-date=3 November 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his signing, Burley described O'Keefe as "a young player with big potential".&lt;ref name="Palacesigning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/burley-adds-squad-signing-winger-o-keefe/story-11361141-detail/story.html |title=Burley adds to his squad with signing of winger O'Keefe |publisher=Croydon Advertiser |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer was free, although Southend would receive a percentage of any transfer fee for O'Keefe in his first 36 months at [[Selhurst Park]].&lt;ref name="Joinspalace"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/8342260.O_Keefe_joins_Palace/ |title=Stuart O'Keefe joins Crystal Palace |newspaper=Southend Echo |first=Chris |last=Phillips |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club on 20 November 2010 as a substitute in place of [[Paddy McCarthy]] during a 3–2 defeat to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], later being substituted himself in the 89th minute of the match for [[Pablo Couñago]] as Palace pushed for an equaliser.&lt;ref name="Palacedebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9194912.stm |title=Sheffield United 3–2 Crystal Palace |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season at Selhurst Park, O'Keefe was a back up player in the squad and made just four appearances during the course of the season.&lt;ref name="sb1011"/&gt; In the 2011–12 season, O'Keefe was given a chance to impress early on in the season in the League Cup, playing five times in the competition during the season as the team reached the semi-final, including starting in the team's 2–1 quarter final victory over Manchester United on 30 November 2011 at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref name="Manutd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15850177 |title=Manchester United 1–2 Crystal Palace (aet) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the season, O'Keefe was part of the end of season run in due to injuries and finished the season with 19 appearances for the first team, which saw him offered a new three-year contract with Palace that would last until summer 2015.&lt;ref name="Palacecontract"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/stuart-finished-article-potential/story-16183302-detail/story.html |title=Stuart not the finished article |newspaper=Croydon Advertiser |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012–13 season, Palace achieved promotion to the [[Premier League]] via the Championship play-offs after finishing fifth.O'Keefe featured just five times in the league during the season although he did make two appearances during the play-offs, replacing [[Wilfried Zaha]] as a late substitute during the second leg of their semi-final victory over [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], and then playing the majority of the [[2013 Football League Championship play-off Final|2013 Championship play-off Final]] after replacing [[Kagisho Dikgacoi]] due to injury after just 17 minutes as Palace claimed a 1–0 victory in extra-time to earn promotion.&lt;ref name="Folklore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuart-o-keefe-aiming-to-etch-his-name-into-crystal-palace-folklore-1-5122970 |title=Stuart O'Keefe aiming to etch his name into Crystal Palace folklore |newspaper=Diss Express |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215035/http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuart-o-keefe-aiming-to-etch-his-name-into-crystal-palace-folklore-1-5122970 |archive-date=3 November 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="play-offfinal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22592831 |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the club's Premier League campaign the following season, on 31 August 2013, O'Keefe sealed a 3–1 victory in Palace's first three points of their Premier League return in the 92nd minute at home to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] with a curling 20 yard shot after coming on as a late substitute,&lt;ref name="Firstgoal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23822589 |title=Crystal Palace 3-1 Sunderland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first senior goal of his career and what later turned out to be his only goal for Palace.&lt;ref name="sb1314"/&gt;

At the start of the 2014–15 season, O'Keefe featured in Palace's opening two matches of the Premier League season, defeats to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], but suffered an ankle injury in the latter which kept him out of the team for two months that saw him omitted from the club's 25-man squad for the Premier League season by new Palace manager [[Neil Warnock]].&lt;ref name="whois"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/just-who-cardiff-citys-new-8527504 |title=Who is Stuart O'Keefe?

On 27 November 2014, O'Keefe eventually secured a loan move away from Palace on the final day of the emergency loan window,&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/cardiff-city/interview/interview-stuart-okeefe_203329.html |title=Interview: Stuart O'Keefe |publisher=Sports Mole |first=Matt |last=Law |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining struggling Championship club [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on loan until 1 January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =O'Keefe Goes Out On Loan|url = https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/november/okeefe-joins-blackpool/|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date =27 November 2014| accessdate =27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] defender [[Kevin Foley (footballer)|Kevin Foley]].&lt;ref name="BBCblackpoolloan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30228277 |title=Blackpool: Kevin Foley and Stuart O'Keefe join on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 November 2016 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 29 November 2014, starting in a 1–1 draw with [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], being replaced by [[Nathan Delfouneso]] after 56 minutes,&lt;ref name="Blackpooldebut"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30155877 |title=Rotherham United 1–1 Blackpool |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make four appearances for the team before returning to Palace.&lt;ref name="sb1415"/&gt; On his return to Selhurst Park, O'Keefe found himself under a new manager for the fourth time since August 2014, following the appointment of [[Alan Pardew]]. Despite being handed a starting spot in Pardew's first match in charge at the club, a 4–0 win over non-League team [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in the third round of the FA Cup on 4 January 2015,&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30614379#tab-0 |title=Dover Athletic 0–4 Crystal Palace |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was later informed that he was not part of the manager's new plans at the club.&lt;ref name="whois"/&gt;

===Cardiff City===
On 28 January 2015, O'Keefe signed for Championship club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], who beat off competition from [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]],&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O'Keefe Joins Cardiff City |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/january/okeefe-joins-cardiff-city/|date=28 January 2015|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining former Palace teammates [[Danny Gabbidon]] and Kagisho Dikgacoi at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Gabbidon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/crystal-palace-midfielder-joins-cardiff-city/story-25936240-detail/story.html |title=Crystal Palace midfielder joins Cardiff City |publisher=Croydon Advertiser |date=28 January 2015 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], having trained with the team for just two days following the completion of his transfer,&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; in a 2–0 loss.&lt;ref name="sb1415"/&gt; He featured in the following two matches but,&lt;ref name="sb1415"/&gt; with heavy competition from [[Peter Whittingham]], [[Joe Ralls]] and [[Aron Gunnarsson]], he did not appear for the first team again until 11 April and made a total of just six appearances during the second half of the season for Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Outcast"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-outcast-midfield-regular-10859135 |title=From Cardiff City outcast to midfield regular...

The start of the following season continued the same trend for O'Keefe as he made just eight appearances during the first five months of the season before returning to the starting line up against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 16 January 2016, in a match that Cardiff went on to win 3–1.&lt;ref name="Outcast"/&gt; O'Keefe's performances saw him establish himself in the first team and his attitude to being left out of the team for long periods drew praise from Cardiff manager [[Russell Slade]] who commented "Stuart has got a fantastic attitude, he's a real, real good professional, even when he wasn't in the side he was pushing. [...] some players when they're not in the side get disillusioned and want to move on, but not O'Keefe."&lt;ref name="Zerotohero"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/zero-cardiff-city-hero-story-11130606 |title=From zero to Cardiff City hero...

His impressive form during the second half of the 2015–16 season saw him handed a new contract during the summer, keeping him at Cardiff until summer 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City: Stuart O'Keefe signs new Bluebirds deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36958614 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 August 2016 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After featuring as an unused substitute during the first match of the 2016–17 season, O'Keefe was handed his first appearance of the season in a 1–0 defeat to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in the first round of the [[EFL Cup]], where he suffered a broken arm in extra-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff City's Stuart O'Keefe suffers suspected broken arm |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37059497 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2016 |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return to the team one month later on 25 September, helping Cardiff to their second win of the season during a 2–1 win against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rotherham United 1–2 Cardiff City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37392288 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with first-team opportunities limited at Cardiff, on 31 January 2017, O'Keefe joined League One club [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] on loan until 1 May 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mkdons.com/news/article/2016-17/dons-bring-in-bluebirds-midfielder-3549072.aspx |title=Dons bring in Bluebirds midfielder |publisher=Milton Keynes Dons F.C. |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=1 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making his debut for the club as a substitute in place of [[Chuks Aneke]] during a 1–1 draw with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 4 February 2017.&lt;ref name="Donsdebut"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38778821 |title=MK Dons 1–1 Bolton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2017 |accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of 18 appearances during the loan spell, scoring four times.&lt;ref name="sb1617"&gt;{{Soccerbase season|49628|2016|access-date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2017, O'Keefe joined League One club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on loan until the end of the [[2017–18 Portsmouth F.C. season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2017/august/okeefe-signs-on-loan/ |title=O'Keefe signs on loan |publisher=Portsmouth F.C. |date=31 August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the following season, O'Keefe was sent out on loan for the second successive season, joining [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/2018/august/its-ok/ |title=It's O'K |publisher=Plymouth Argyle F.C. |date=24 August 2018 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Style of play==
After originally beginning his career as a winger,&lt;ref name="Palacesigning"/&gt; O'Keefe switched to central midfield and was described by former Cardiff City manager [[Russell Slade]] as a "hard working, energetic, athletic midfield player."&lt;ref name="whois"/&gt; Slade also praised O'Keefe for his determination when not playing regularly in the first team, stating " Stuart will roll his sleeves up, work harder, to try and show his manager and the coaching staff that he's capable of playing in the first team."&lt;ref name="Zerotohero"/&gt;
