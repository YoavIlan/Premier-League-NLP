'''Nathaniel Edwin Clyne''' (born 5 April 1991) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[right back]] for [[AFC Bournemouth]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from fellow {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

He began his career at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], playing regularly in four [[EFL Championship|Championship]] seasons, before a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2012, where he spent three seasons in the Premier League. He joined Liverpool in July 2015 for a fee of £12.5&amp;nbsp;million.

Formerly an international at [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21 level]], Clyne made his senior international debut for [[England national football team|England]] in November 2014. He was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].
