'''Michy Batshuayi-Atunga''' ({{IPA-fr|mi(t)ʃi batʃu.a.(j)i}}; born 2 October 1993) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

He began his professional career at [[Standard Liège]] in 2011, scoring 44 goals in 120 games across all competitions. His 21 goals in the [[2013–14 Belgian Pro League]] made him the second-highest scorer and contributed to his [[Ebony Shoe Award]]. He then transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for £4.5&amp;nbsp;million, helping them reach the [[2016 Coupe de France Final]]. In July 2016, he was signed by Chelsea for £33&amp;nbsp;million, and scored the goal that won the [[List of English football champions|Premier League title]] in his [[2016–17 Premier League|debut season]].

Batshuayi scored in his international debut for Belgium against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] in March 2015. He was part of their side that reached the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and third place at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

Born in [[Brussels]], Batshuayi had a nomadic youth career with spells at Evere, Schaarbeek, [[FC Brussels|Brussels]] (twice) and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] before he joined [[Standard Liège]].&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

Batshuayi made his debut for the senior team on 20 February 2011 in a 4–1 loss away to [[KAA Gent|Gent]], replacing [[Franck Berrier]] for the last seven minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match/_/id/312017?cc=3436|title=KAA Gent 4 Liege 1|date=20 February 2011|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, he made his only other appearance of the [[Belgian Pro League]] [[2010–11 Belgian Pro League|season]], filling in for [[Aloys Nong]] in the last minute of a 3–0 victory against [[KV Mechelen]] at the [[Stade Maurice Dufrasne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Liege 3–0 KV Mechelen|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/match?gameId=303421|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July, Batshuayi was an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the [[2011 Belgian Super Cup]], a 1–0 loss to Gent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Genk edge Standard to win first Super Cup|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bel/news/newsid=1652485.html|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December, he scored his first professional goal, the only one away to [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] in the last match of Group B during the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group B|2011–12 UEFA Europa League]] group stage, advancing his team into the knockout stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2012/matches/round=2000272/match=2007411/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Solid Standard march on unbeaten after FCK win|date=15 December 2011|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, he added two more in a 2–1 win at [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] in the quarter-final first leg of the [[Belgian Cup]], although his side lost 5–4 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Standard: Batshuayi l'homme du match, au Lierse|trans-title=Standard:Batshuayi man of the match, at Lierse|url=http://www.sudinfo.be/264344/article/sports/foot-belge/standard/2011-12-22/standard-batshuayi-l%E2%80%99homme-du-match-au-lierse|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=Sud Info|date=22 December 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first league goal on 14 January 2012 to round off a 6–1 home win over [[Beerschot A.C.|Germinal Beerschot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Standard vernedert zwak Beerschot|trans-title=Standard humiliate weak Beerschot|url=http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/1.1195302|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=Sporza|date=14 January 2012|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended the campaign with six. He was sent-off as a substitute in a 3–2 loss at Genk on 22 April for stamping on the chest of [[Jeroen Simaeys]], for which the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] suspended him for four matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foot : Michy Batshuayi (Standard) convoqué devant le Comité sportif mardi|trans-title=Football: Michy Batshuayi (Standard) summoned before the Sports Committee on Monday|url=http://www.lesoir.be/59063/article/actualite/fil-info/2012-08-27/foot-michy-batshuayi-standard-convoqu%C3%A9-devant-comit%C3%A9-sportif-mardi|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=Le Soir|date=22 April 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batshuayi was again sent-off on 25 September 2012 in a 3–2 win at [[Royal Mouscron-Péruwelz|Mouscron]] in the sixth round of the Belgian Cup, having elbowed Benjamin Delacourt within the first half-hour; he was suspended for the next two matches of the competition and fined €200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Standard accepte la suspension de Batshuayi|trans-title=Standard accept Batshuayi's suspension|url=http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1745/Standard/article/detail/1507843/2012/09/27/Le-Standard-accepte-la-suspension-de-Batshuayi.dhtml|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=7sur7|date=27 September 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview a month later, he said he felt "destroyed" by the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Batshuayi : "C’était très dur pour moi après Mouscron"|trans-title=Batshuayi: "It was very hard for me after Mouscron|url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/division1/standard/batshuayi-c-etait-tres-dur-pour-moi-apres-mouscron-51b74c52e4b0de6db9785a91|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=DH|date=2 November 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded 12 goals in 26 matches over the campaign, including two on 19 May 2013 to decide a 4–3 home win over [[K.S.C.

===Marseille===
On 8 August 2014, Batshuayi signed with French club [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for a £4.5&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/division1/standard/batshuayi-vers-marseille-53a7a85c3570c0e743403706#.U6dnGeSbi_Q.twitter|title=Batshuayi vers Marseille !|trans-title=Batshuayi to Marseille!|date=23 June 2014|publisher=DHNET|accessdate=23 June 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; He made his debut the next day as Marseille began the [[Ligue 1]] season with a 3–2 win at [[SC Bastia|Bastia]], replacing [[Dimitri Payet]] with 11 minutes remaining. On 29 October, he scored his first goal for the club to open a 2–1 defeat at [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] in the third round of the [[Coupe de la Ligue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'OM éliminé à l'ultime seconde !|trans-title=OM eliminated in the last second!|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match/334512|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=L'Equipe|date=19 October 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored nine league goals for [[Marcelo Bielsa]]'s team, despite rarely starting matches.&lt;ref name=four/&gt; On 22 February 2015, within five minutes of coming on for [[André-Pierre Gignac]], he scored twice away to [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] in an eventual 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match nul à suspense à Geoffroy-Guichard.|trans-title=Suspenseful draw at ''Geoffroy-Guichard''|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match/316426|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=L'Equipe|date=22 February 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he added further braces in away victories at [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] and [[RC Lens|Lens]] (6–1 and 4–0 respectively), the latter after taking Gignac's place at half-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michy Batshuayi leads rout as Marseille refind form at Toulouse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/06/toulouse-marseille-ligue-1-match-report|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BATSHUAYI BAGS BRACE IN MARSEILLE ROMP|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/batshuayi-bags-brace-in-marseille-romp.htm|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=Ligue 1|date=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of the most wanted players on the market. There were a lot of offers for him this summer, but he didn't want to leave. He's proving himself on the pitch, and if clubs want him then they are going to have to pay around €50m."&lt;ref name=four/&gt; By the mid-season break, he had 11 goals from 19 matches, behind only [[Le Classique|arch-rival]] [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], with Marseille in tenth in the league table and PSG in first.&lt;ref name=four/&gt; Batshuayi finished the league season with 17 goals.

On 15 August, Batshuayi made his competitive debut in Chelsea's opening match of the [[2016–17 Chelsea F.C. season|2016–17 season]], coming off the substitutes' bench to set-up [[Diego Costa]]'s late winner in a 2–1 win over West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/report?gameId=451007 |title=Diego Costa's late winner helps Chelsea defeat West Ham in opener |date=15 August 2016 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, after replacing Oscar, he went on to score his first Premier League goal in a victory by the same score at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37067781 |title=Watford 1–2 Chelsea: Diego Costa scored the winner for the second game |date=20 August 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August, Batshuayi made his first start for Chelsea in the [[2016–17 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]], scoring a brace in a 3–2 home victory against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chelsea 3–2 Bristol Rovers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37091061 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May, Batshuayi came on as a second-half substitute against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] with the score 0–0, with Chelsea needing a victory to clinch the [[2016–17 Premier League|Premier League]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/chelsea-west-brom-premier-league-title-clinch-video-051217 |title=Chelsea can clinch Premier League title with win at West Brom |work=Fox Sports |author=Sports Illustrated |date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 82nd minute, he slotted a goal past goalkeeper [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] to win Chelsea their fifth Premier League title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39813798|title=West Bromwich Albion 0–1 Chelsea|date=12 May 2017|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batshuayi went on to score three goals in Chelsea's final two matches, including the last goal of the season in the 92nd minute of Chelsea's 5–1 win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. Batshuayi finished the season with 5 goals in only 236 minutes of Premier League action, equaling a rate of one goal every 47 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/chelsea/363/blog/post/3131899/michy-batshuayi-unerring-eye-for-goal-is-earning-young-charge-a-second-chelsea-chance |title=Batshuayi's unerring eye for goal is earning young charge a second chance |publisher=ESPNFC |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate = 23 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Valencia====
On 10 August 2018, Batshuayi was loaned to Spanish [[La Liga]] club [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] for the [[2018–19 Valencia CF season|2018–19 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michy Batshuayi: Chelsea striker joins Valencia on a season-long loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45148680 |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, he made his Liga debut as a 76th-minute substitute for [[Carlos Soler (footballer)|Carlos Soler]] in a 1–1 home draw with Atlético Madrid, then continued that role in subsequent matches in a side possessing [[Rodrigo (footballer, born 1991)|Rodrigo]], [[Santi Mina]] and [[Kevin Gameiro]] as striking options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harbord |first1=Oliver |title=Why Michy Batshuayi is struggling to shake off substitute tag after stuttering start in Spain |url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/michy-batshuayi-latest-chelsea-news-15113891 |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Football London |date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September, he scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw with [[RC Celta de Vigo|Celta de Vigo]], therefore becoming the first player to score in the top leagues of France, Germany, England and Spain in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guest |first1=Rob |title=The incredible record Chelsea ace Michy Batshuayi has set after scoring his first Valencia goal |url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/michy-batshuayi-chelsea-news-latest-15208990 |accessdate=28 September 2018 |publisher=Football London |date=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:ENG-BEL (28).jpg|thumb|right|Batshuayi playing for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Batshuayi was eligible to play for the [[DR Congo national football team|DR Congo national team]] through his parents, but in March 2015, he ruled out this option, stating that although his Congolese heritage is important to him, he would rather represent [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/05/olympique-marseilles-michy-batshuayi-chooses-belgium-over-dr-congo/|title=Olympique Marseille’s Michy Batshuayi Chooses Belgium Over DR Congo|date=5 March 2015|publisher=Caught Offside|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batshuayi made his international debut for Belgium on 28 March 2015 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]]. Replacing [[Christian Benteke]] in the 77th minute, he scored from outside the penalty area three minutes later to seal a 5–0 victory at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scholten|first1=Berend|title=Classy Belgium too strong for Cyprus|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/season=2016/matches/round=2000446/match=2013931/postmatch/report/|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=UEFA|date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|final tournament]] in France, making his competition debut in the last 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in [[Toulouse]] on 26 June. With his first touch, he finished [[Eden Hazard]]'s assist for the second goal of a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2016: Hungary 0 Belgium 4 – Alderweireld, Hazard, Batshuayi and Carrasco goals set up quarter-final against Wales|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/26/hungary-v-belgium-euro-2016-live/|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Batshuayi scored once in a 4–3 win away to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 7 October 2017, with the ''Red Devils'' already assured of their place in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Vaishali|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina 3 Belgium 4: Vertonghen and Batshuayi on target as Fellaini forced off with knee injury|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/bosniaherzegovina-3-belgium-4-vertonghen-and-batshuayi-on-target-as-fellaini-forced-off-with-knee-a3653036.html|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=Evening Standard|date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Roberto Martínez]] named him in the 23-man squad to go to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Belgium include Vincent Kompany but Christian Benteke misses out |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44353673 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their second group stage match, he came on as a 68th-minute substitute against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] and missed several chances before finally scoring the fifth goal for Belgium in a 5–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Massart |first1=Simon |title=Batshuayi's perseverance pays dividends |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/batshuayi-perseverance-pays-dividends-2966457 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |publisher=FIFA |date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A December 2015 profiling by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' likened Batshuayi for his speed, strength, positioning and link-up play to [[Didier Drogba]], despite being shorter than the Ivorian.&lt;ref name=four/&gt;

==Personal life==
Batshuayi is nicknamed "Batsman", a play on the name of the superhero [[Batman]].&lt;ref name=batsman/&gt; His younger brother [[Aaron Leya Iseka]] plays for Toulouse in the same position, coming through at Anderlecht and signing for Marseille on loan, one month after Batshuayi's exit.&lt;ref name=bfm&gt;{{cite news |title=OM : cinq choses à savoir sur Aaron Leya Iseka, le petit frère de Michy Batshuayi|trans-title=OM: five things to know about Aaron Leya Iseka, Michy Batshuayi's little brother |url=https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/om-cinq-choses-a-savoir-sur-aaron-leya-iseka-le-petit-frere-de-michy-1030312.html |accessdate=11 August 2018 |publisher=BFM |date=27 August 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
