'''Asmir Begović''' ({{IPA-sh|âsmir bêːɡoʋitɕ|bs}}; born 20 June 1987) is a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Premier League]] club [[AFC Bournemouth]] and the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]], for which he is [[Captain (association football)#Vice-captain|vice-captain]].

Begović started his professional career with English club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], signing for them in the summer of 2003. After a sequence of loans, he made his Premier League debut in May 2009 and was sold to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for £3.25 million in February 2010. In the [[2012–13 Stoke City F.C. season|2012–13 season]] he played  every  league match and won the [[Stoke City F.C. Player of the Year|club's Player of the Year award]]. In November 2013 Begović became the fifth goalkeeper to score a goal in the Premier League, scoring from 97.5 yards against Southampton after 13 seconds, also getting the World Record for 'longest goal scored in football.' In July 2015, he joined Premier League champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee of £8 million, remaining second-choice until his move to Bournemouth two years later.

Begović represented [[Canada national football team|Canada]] at youth level playing for them at the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. In 2009, he decided to change his allegiance and represent his native country, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He soon established himself as their number one goalkeeper and helped them qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], their first major tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Begović was born in [[Trebinje]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was at the time part of Yugoslavia, to a [[Bosniak]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asmir's world settled at last|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Lankhof/2007/07/01/4305227-sun.html|publisher=Sun Media Corp.|author=Bill Lankhof|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Amir, was also a goalkeeper who played for [[FK Leotar|Leotar]] and [[NK Iskra Bugojno|Iskra Bugojno]] whilst his mother, Ajnija, hails from [[Stolac]]. The Begović family fled the [[Bosnian War]] to Germany when Asmir was four years old, where he began to play organised football with local youth club FC Kirchhausen in [[Heilbronn]]. When he was 10, his family moved to [[Edmonton]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir and Nicolle Begovic: 'I think we've found the perfect match'|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Asmir-Nicolle-Begovic-think-ve-perfect-match/story-13745097-detail/story.html|work=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begović attended the [[St. Francis Xavier High School (Edmonton)|St. Francis Xavier High School]] where he played for their academy.&lt;ref name="Cansoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=article on Asmir Begovic|url=http://www.cansoc.org/archive/index.php/t-21455.html|work=cansoc.org|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played Minor League Soccer with the Southwest Sting Soccer Club in Edmonton which earned him a call-up to the [[Canada men's national youth soccer teams|Canada under-17 squad]].&lt;ref name="Cansoc"/&gt; In 2003, he earned a trial with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and his representatives paid for him to fly over to England.&lt;ref name="Pompey News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pompey set to lose out again on keeper|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/opinion/pompey-set-to-lose-out-again-on-keeper-1-5666594|work=Portsmouth News|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days with Portsmouth coaches David Hurst and [[Mark O'Connor (footballer)|Mark O'Connor]] were suitably impressed and offered Begović a contract before his trial at Tottenham could begin.&lt;ref name="Pompey News"/&gt;

===Portsmouth===
Begović signed a youth contract with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in the summer of 2003 and due to him not having a European Union passport he spent two years on an education visa which prevented him from featuring in matches which involved money being taken on the gate.&lt;ref name="Pompey News"/&gt; After playing for the youth team he then spent time on loan at [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louviere]] in Belgium in 2005 where he played twice in the Belgian top flight.&lt;ref name="Pompey News"/&gt; Begović got his [[Visa (document)|UK visa]] in the summer of 2006 which allowed him to sign on [[loan (association football)|loan]] for [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season, making his [[The Football League|Football League]] debut in a 1–1 draw at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 25 November as an 80th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]], after injury to first choice goalkeeper [[Jonny Brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10393~34413,00.html|title=Stockport vs Macclesfield|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=mtfc.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006054741/http://www.mtfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10393~34413%2C00.html|archivedate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His loan spell was cut short, however, as he sustained a knee injury after making just three appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Begovic ends Silkmen stay|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_2399002,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=21 December 2006|accessdate=19 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121224/http://www.skysports.com/story/0%2C19528%2C11674_2399002%2C00.html|archivedate=29 September 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Begović was loaned to [[AFC Bournemouth]] in [[EFL League One|League One]] in a deal lasting until January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bournemouth sign quartet on loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6939920.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 August 2007|accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled back from Bournemouth on 11 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7040054.stm|title=Pair leave Cherries as loans end|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 2007, Begović was named in Portsmouth's 16-man matchday squad for the first time in a [[Premier League]] game in a match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aston Villa 1–3 Portsmouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7122767.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, he signed for [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on loan for a month with Portsmouth having the right to recall him back when they so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7317449.stm|title=Yeovil loan Premier League pair|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March Begović made his debut for Yeovil, keeping a clean sheet against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Begovic happy with Glovers debut|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7322342.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7309334.stm|title=Yeovil 0–0 Bristol Rovers|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently recalled after making two appearances despite Yeovil trying to re-sign him on an emergency loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7340659.stm|title=Glovers fail in Begovic loan bid|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Glovers" manager [[Russell Slade]] revealed in June 2008 that he wanted to sign Begović on loan again after [[Steve Mildenhall]] joined Southend United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7440414.stm|title=Yeovil target Begovic loan deal|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was delayed however due to his grandfather passing away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7529552.stm|title=Begovic return to Yeovil delayed|accessdate=22 November 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined Yeovil on loan, this time for three months in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keeper Begovic agrees Yeovil loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/y/yeovil/7540726.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 August 2008|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 14 league appearances, keeping three clean sheets in a struggling Yeovil side.

On 1 February 2010, Begović signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for a fee of £3.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8488595.stm|title=Stoke sign Portsmouth keeper Asmir Begovic|accessdate=11 January 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the signing manager [[Tony Pulis]] revealed that he had been tracking Begović for a while.

==International career==
===Canada===
Begović was the starting goalkeeper for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. He made several difficult saves for his team in a 3–0 loss to [[Chile national under-20 football team|Chile]] and let in one goal against [[Austria national under-19 football team|Austria]]. Late in the third match of the tournament, after allowing two goals, Begović came out of his area to play a long ball from a [[DR Congo national under-20 football team|Congo]] defender. The ball took a high bounce off the wet pitch, forcing him to use his hands to prevent it from going over his head. He was shown a straight red card, and midfielder [[Jonathan Beaulieu-Bourgault]] was forced to play in goal, as Canada had used up its three substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New number one for Canada fans|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/canada2007/news/newsid=549236.html#new+number+canada+fans|publisher=fifa.com|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=4 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408081919/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/canada2007/news/newsid%3D549236.html|archivedate=8 April 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2007, 20-year-old Begović received his first call-up to the senior Canada squad for the friendly match with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], but didn't see any action on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mitchell and Canada to face Iceland|url=https://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=216145&amp;hubname=soccer|publisher=Canadian Press|date=14 August 2007|accessdate=19 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929164545/http://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=216145&amp;hubname=soccer|archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, he accepted another call for Canada's [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF Third Round|qualifier]] versus Jamaica, but again didn't get any playing time as [[Lars Hirschfeld]] was the preferred option in goal.

Players with dual nationality, like Begović, who had already played for a country's national team at youth level, were not allowed to switch nationalities after they turned 21, but on 3 June 2009 FIFA removed the age limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Simon|title=Soccer-FIFA removes age limit on players switching nations|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/06/03/soccer-fifa-switching-idUKL317735320090603|work=Reuters.com|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2009, he spoke with Bosnian head coach [[Miroslav Blažević]] about the possibility of making his debut for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

On 12 July 2009 on ''[[Full-Time: Vancouver's Soccer Show]]'' on the [[CKST|TEAM 1040]] radio in Canada he indicated his desire to continue with the Canadian national team. He suggested that comments he had made to Bosnia's head coach had been misinterpreted due to poor translation. In the same interview, Begović also said:

There were talks... but I have no intention on playing for Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Begovic: "I don't want to switch"|url=http://fulltimefootballshow.blogspot.com/2009/07/begovic-i-dont-want-to-switch.html|publisher=fulltimefootballshow|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

However, less than two months later, Begović changed his mind and on 21 August 2009 accepted a call-up for two Bosnia [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|2010 World Cup qualifiers]]: away at [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] on 5 September 2009, and four days later versus [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] at home in [[Zenica]]. During the pre-match preparations, Begović gave an interview to the Bosnian web portal, stating among other things:

{{quote|I was born in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina is my homeland and I wouldn't be disappointed even if I don't get a chance to play right away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ako i ne dobijem šansu, neću biti razočaran|url=http://sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/090904063|publisher=sarajevo-x.com|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He did not play in either match. However, his debut for the national team finally came in the next qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]]. He came on to replace [[Kenan Hasagić]] in the 92nd minute of the match, in which Bosnia won the match with a final score of 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/world-cup/2010/estonia-bosnia-herzegovina-249429.html|title=Estonia v Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Yahoo!

On 3 March he played a significant role in a match for the first time as he got to play the second half in Bosnia's [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. Bosnia won the match 2–1 and Begović didn't concede any goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina 2–1 Ghana|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2010/03/03/1816436/bosnia-herzegovina-2-1-ghana-dragons-rally-to-defeat-black|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414035448/http://goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2010/03/03/1816436/bosnia-herzegovina-2-1-ghana-dragons-rally-to-defeat-black|archivedate=14 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first full cap against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in May 2010. Bosnia lost the match 4–2, but Begović was not responsible for any of the goals according to the Bosnian media, as they blamed Bosnia's defense for the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/sweden-v-bosnia-and-herzegovina-29-may-2010-289313/|title=Sweden 4–2 Bosnia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caused controversy after he pulled out of Bosnia's friendlies against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9398677.stm|title=Stoke resolve row with Bosnian FA over Asmir Begovic|accessdate=18 February 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224071708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9398677.stm|archivedate=24 February 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since August 2012, Begović has been the first choice goalkeeper for the national team. On 27 May 2013, Begović has been voted the 2012 Bosnian Footballer of the Year by the Bosnian Sport Writers' Jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begović named Bosnian idol|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bih/news/newsid=1961955.html|publisher=uefa.com|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2013 Bosnia defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 1–0 to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], their first major tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir Begovic: Bosnia goalkeeper plans World Cup upsets|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24574103|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, he was named in Bosnia and Herzegovina's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/bosnia-and-herzegovina/10810419/Bosnia-Herzegovina-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 2014 World Cup Squad|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played full 90 minutes in all 3 matches.

==Personal life==
On 18 June 2011, Begović married his American-born wife, Nicolle Howard, with whom he has two daughters, Taylor and Blair Rose Begović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Asmir-Nicolle-Begovic-think-ve-perfect-match/story-13745097-detail/story.html#axzz2ZJtMAyOf|title=Asmir and Nicolle Begovic: 'I think we've found the perfect match'|website=thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|date=8 July 2012|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Stoke-City-star-Asmir-Begovic-takes-time-open-new/story-19259690-detail/story.html#axzz2ZJtMAyOftitle=Stoke City star Asmir Begovic takes time out to open new building at daughter's school|website=thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsport.ba/magazin/asmir-begovic-postao-otac/226175|title=Asmir Begović po drugi put postao otac!|publisher=sportsport.ba|date=23 February 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 he joined [[FC Edmonton]]'s charity 'Kicks for Kids Program'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4177305|title=Kicks for Kids Program Gets a Boost From a Soccer Star|website=oursportscentral.com|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begović was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina while it was part of the SFR Yugoslavia, and moved to Germany at the age of four.&lt;ref name="Asmir Begovic: World Cup can reunite Bosnia's golden generation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Steve|title=Asmir Begovic: World Cup can reunite Bosnia's 'golden generation'|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27442963|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=BBC Sports|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in Germany, Begović supported [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and cites goalkeeping great [[Oliver Kahn]] as his inspiration. He also attended matches at his local club [[VfB Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoke City Official Matchday Magazine 24 September 2011 v Manchester United&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his native [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], Begović is fluent in three additional languages: [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scsport.ba/vijest/50496 Begović izabrao: RVP i Mata najbolji u Premiershipu, protiv CR7 bilo je najteže, Kahn najveći...] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013 he set up his own charity, the Asmir Begović Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir Begovic Foundation|url=http://www.asmirbegovicfoundation.com/|work=ABF|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begović's younger brother Denis plays for [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City's]] Under 18s as a goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denis Begovic Player Profile|url=https://www.bcfc.co.uk/teams/under-18s-squad/denis-begovic/|work=Bristol City|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
