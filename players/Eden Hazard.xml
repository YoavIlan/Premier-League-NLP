Hazard is the son of two former footballers and began his career in Belgium playing for local youth clubs. In 2005, he moved to France where he began his senior career, joining [[Ligue 1|first division]] club [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. Hazard spent two years in the club's academy and, at the age of 16, made his professional debut in November 2007. He went on to become an integral part of the Lille team under manager [[Rudi Garcia]], racking up over 190 appearances. In his first full season as a starter, he won the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award, becoming the first non-French player to win the award.&lt;ref name="Lille OSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eden Hazard prolonge son contrat au LOSC|url=http://www.losc.fr/?r=0,0,18,4500|publisher=Lille OSC|accessdate=10 April 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]], Hazard captured the award again, becoming the first player to win the award twice.&lt;ref name="young_player"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hazard named Young Player of Year|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/hazard-named-young-player-of-year.htm|publisher=Ligue de Football Professionnel|date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named to the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]].

==Early life==
Hazard was born in [[La Louvière]] and grew up in [[Braine-le-Comte]]. His mother, Carine, and father, Thierry, were both footballers. His father spent most of his career at [[semi-professional]] level with [[R.A.A. Louviéroise|La Louvière]] in the [[Belgian Second Division]],&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/les-hazard-une-famille-de-foot-13-05-2011-1447493.php | title = Les Hazard, une famille de foot | date = 15 March 2011 | accessdate = 19 December 2011 |work=Le Parisien | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; playing mainly as a [[defensive midfielder]].&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt; His mother played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] in the [[Belgian Women's First Division]] and stopped playing when she was three months pregnant with Eden.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eden_family"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/LOSC/2010/01/29/article_avant-d-etre-partagee-entre-lille-et-len.shtml|title=Avant d'être partagée entre Lille et Lens, la famille Hazard a cultivé son jardin secret|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|work=La Voix des Sports|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing football, both parents became sports teachers.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt; Thierry retired from his position in 2009 in order to devote more time to his children.&lt;ref name="eden_leparisien"/&gt;

Hazard is the eldest of four children. He has three brothers, all of whom play football, including [[Thorgan Hazard|Thorgan]], who joined him at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2012 but then moved to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31590137|last=|first=|title=Chelsea man to stay at Borussia Mönchengladbach|date=24 February 2014|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorgan had previously progressed through the youth ranks of Lille's [[Derby du Nord|biggest rivals]] [[RC Lens|Lens]].&lt;ref name="Eden Hazard brother Thorgan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thorgan Hozard joins Chelsea |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2859608,00.html |work=[[Chelsea F.C.]] |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726143551/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10268~2859608%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eden_hazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html|title=Eden Hazard, protection rapprochée|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=10 April 2010|publisher=FIFA|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501150142/http://fr.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=955072.html|archivedate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |title=Eden est entouré de professionnels |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=10 April 2010 |publisher=Foot Goal |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105084607/http://www.footgoal.net/suite.php?selection=21280 |archivedate= 5 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |title=L'interview découverte de Thorgan Hazard |accessdate=10 March 2010 |publisher=Lensois |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313121407/http://www.lensois.com/article-1911-l-interview-decouverte-de-thorgan-hazard.html |archivedate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard's other younger brothers are [[Kylian Hazard|Kylian]] and Ethan.

Hazard and his three brothers were raised in a comfortable environment with their parents ensuring they had whatever they needed to excel.&lt;ref name="eden_hazard2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/hazard-lights-the-way-for-belgium | title = Hazard lights the way for Belgium |date= 5 March 2010 | accessdate = 10 April 2010 | publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived "no more than three metres" from a football training ground and the brothers often ventured onto a training pitch through a small hole in order to hone and develop their skills.&lt;ref name="eden_family"/&gt; Growing up his idol was French playmaker [[Zinedine Zidane]], with Hazard "watching him on television and online for hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelseas-eden-hazard-i-want-to-play-under-zinedine-zidane-a3174561.html |title=Chelsea's Eden Hazard: I want to play under Zinedine Zidane |work=London Evening Standard |date=6 February 2016 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Hazard began his football career playing for hometown club Royal Stade Brainois at the age of four. During his time at the club, one of his youth coaches described him as a "gifted" player. He added: "He knew everything. I had nothing to teach him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |title=À Braine-le-Comte, sur les traces d'Eden Hazard |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011 |publisher=Nord Éclair |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422040603/http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |archivedate=22 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard spent eight years at the club before moving to [[A.F.C. Tubize|Tubize]]. While at Tubize, he was spotted by a Lille scout while playing in a local tournament with the club. The scout's subsequent report on the player prompted club officials to meet with Hazard's father and offer the young player an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract.&lt;ref name="eden_contract"&gt;{{cite news |title=8 nouveaux professionnels au LOSC|url=http://www.losc.fr/?r=0,0,14,20|work=[[Lille OSC]] |accessdate=10 April 2010 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazard's parents accepted the offer from Lille with hopes that the training facilities in France would be better.&lt;ref name="eden_hazard2"/&gt; Hazard's father later admitted that the decision to let Eden and, later Thorgan, join clubs in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|North of France]] was the best solution stating "They remained so close to home and, at the same time, they integrated at structures where they could grow, because in Belgium, unfortunately, it's a little empty for the training of youth".&lt;ref name="eden_family"/&gt;

Hazard joined Lille in 2005 and spent two years developing in the club's local sports school, due to its youth academy in Luchin not being in operation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/video/videoid=1683656.html?autoplay=true|title=Lille's Hazard looks back and forward to Trabzonspor|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=27 September 2011|publisher=[[UEFA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2007, he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Lille.&lt;ref name="eden_contract"/&gt; At the start of the [[2007-08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]], at the age of 16, Hazard was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth level of [[Football in France|French football]], though he still played with Lille's under-18 team in its league and the [[Coupe Gambardella]].

Under Advocaat, Hazard became a starter in the team and, on 14 November 2009, played a full match for the first time in his international career. In the match, which was played against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], Hazard assisted on two goals in a 3–0 win.

In May 2010, Advocaat was replaced as manager by [[Georges Leekens]]. After featuring as a starter in Leekens first three matches in charge, Hazard began appearing as a substitute for Belgium during the 2010–11 season. Leekens justified his benching of Hazard citing the players' domestic performance, which had been underwhelming at the time, while also admitting that Hazard displayed a lack of desire in training with the national team and often neglected his defensive duties during international matches.&lt;ref name="hazard_leekens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hazard-Leekens: l'incompréhension? |url=http://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/diablesrouges/detail_hazard-leekens-l-incomprehension?id=6550763|work=RTBF.be|date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing as a substitute in two straight matches, Hazard returned to the starting lineup for the team's November 2010 friendly match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. In the match, which Belgium won 2–0, Hazard assisted on the team's opening goal scored by [[Romelu Lukaku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Belgium beats Russia 2–0 in friendly |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-11-17-2155338329_x.htm|work=USA Today |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After featuring as a starter in the team's 1–1 draw with [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in February 2011, Hazard was relegated back to the substitute's bench for the team's important March 2011 [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] matches as Leekens preferred [[Nacer Chadli]] and [[Mousa Dembélé (footballer, born 1987)|Mousa Dembélé]] on the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Un problème Hazard? |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2011/20110329_091853_un-probleme-hazard.html|work=[[L'Equipe]]|date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the team's 29 March qualifier against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], he appeared as a second-half substitute and assisted on the team's final goal in a 4–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Belgique flambe avec Hazard |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/154831/la-belgique-flambe-avec-hazard/ |work=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907183753/http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/154831/la-belgique-flambe-avec-hazard/ |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the matches, French media began questioning why Hazard was struggling to be appreciated in his home country, while, at the same time, was being praised in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hazard n'est pas prophète en son plat pays |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |work=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005505/http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Wilmots, assistant coach of the national team, responded to the media reports stating "Some people only see Eden's qualities" and "the French press are sometimes blinded by his moments of magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilmots: Hazard needs more than talent|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1409933.html|publisher=FIFA|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium's next competitive match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 3 June 2011, Hazard started the match, but was substituted out after 60 minutes. Disappointed with his performance and substitution, the midfielder retired to the locker room and was later spotted on television outside the stadium with his family eating a [[hamburger]] while the match was still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leekens et Hazard pourront-ils un jour s'entendre?|url=http://sportmagazine.levif.be/sport/actualite/leekens-et-hazard-pourront-ils-un-jour-s-entendre/article-1195028318709.htm|publisher=Sportmagazine.be|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the episode, which has become known as ''Burgergate'' in Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazard a insulté Leekens!|url=http://sportmagazine.levif.be/sport/actualite/hazard-a-insulte-leekens/article-1195083841449.htm|publisher=Sportmagazine.be|date=17 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard apologized for the defection, while Leekens attributed Hazard's response to the substitution as "a young player making a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal target Hazard fails to impress Wenger after Belgium walkout|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2000706/Arsenal-target-Eden-Hazard-storms-Belgium-boss.html|work=Daily Mail|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leekens: "Hazard, je ne lui en veux pas"|url=http://www.chronofoot.com/belgique/leekens-hazard-je-ne-lui-en-veux-pas_mrm164750.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119041019/http://www.chronofoot.com/belgique/leekens-hazard-je-ne-lui-en-veux-pas_mrm164750.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 January 2013|publisher=Chronofoot|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=5 August 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August, Leekens announced that Hazard would be disciplined for his actions during the Turkey match and, as a result, would miss the team's 10 August friendly match against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], as well as the team's Euro qualifying return match against Azerbaijan on 2 September and friendly against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Slovénie – Belgique: pas de Hazard, Leekens le sanctionne |url=http://www.lalibre.be/sports/football/article/677218/belgique-slovenie-pas-de-hazard-leekens-le-sanctionne.html|work=La Libre|date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August, Hazard's management group issued a press release to the Belgian media.

==Style of play==
[[File:Hazard taking on Howson.jpg|thumb|right|Hazard taking on the [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] defence for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in October 2012]]

Hazard primarily plays as either an [[Attacking midfielders|attacking midfielder]] or a [[Left winger|winger]] and has been credited as being "possibly the outstanding talent in Europe right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new Belgian golden generation|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/770540/wim-van-walle-the-new-belgian-golden-generation|publisher=ESPN FC|first=Wim|last=Van Walle|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Lille under former manager Rudi Garcia, Hazard often played in the latter role in the team's 4–3–3 formation and regularly switched flanks because he could use both feet. Following the departures of fellow [[Playmaker|play-makers]] [[Yohan Cabaye]] and [[Gervinho]] in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, Garcia played Hazard in a creative role as a central attacking midfielder, while also allowing the player to roam back onto the wing if necessary. Two of Hazard's most common exemplary traits are his pace and [[Dribbling#Association football|technical ability]], which have been described as "astonishing" and "mesmerizing".&lt;ref name="hazard_fifa"/&gt; His speed and dribbling skills, combined with his creativity,&lt;ref name="hazard_espn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" St Etienne v Lille"/&gt;&lt;ref name="targets"/&gt; as well as his flair, balance, agility, and low centre of gravity, courtesy of his diminutive stature (1.73 m/5 feet 8 inches),&lt;ref name="Chelsea profile"/&gt; allow him to retain possession, take on defenders, and beat opponents in one on one situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1978449-eden-hazard-what-makes-him-the-best-player-in-the-premier-league |title=Eden Hazard Showing Class That Makes Him Best Player in the Premier League |publisher=bleacherreport.com |last1=Levene |first1=Dan |date=2 March 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/3188122/eden-hazard-among-chelsea-stars-put-through-speed-dribbling-test |title=Eden Hazard among Chelsea stars put through speed dribbling test |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Twomey |first1=Liam |date=25 August 2017 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/are-romelu-lukaku-dries-mertens-and-eden-hazard-the-world-cup-s--82060 |title=Are Lukaku, Mertens &amp; Hazard the World Cup's most complete attacking partnership? |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |date=18 June 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.squawka.com/en/news/eden-hazard-ballon-dor/30473#g9LEXKMWOK20vLqW.97 |title=Eden's Era?

At Chelsea, Hazard matured into a world class player and was primarily utilised as a left midfielder, a position which enables him to cut into the centre and strike on goal with his stronger right foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://it.eurosport.com/calcio/premier-league/2016-2017/diego-costa-fa-felice-conte-il-chelsea-batte-il-west-ham-all-89_sto5724264/story.shtml |title=Diego Costa fa felice Conte: il Chelsea batte il West Ham all'89' |publisher=Eurosport |language=Italian |first1=Stefano |last1=Silvestri |date=15 August 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His development into one of the world's best players was highlighted in the [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 Season]]; during this season he won multiple awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11599121/Eden-Hazard-named-2015-footballer-of-the-year-by-the-Football-Writers-Association.html|title=Eden Hazard named 2015 footballer of the year by the Football Writers' Association|date=12 May 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received praise from pundits and manager alike.

He's also very difficult to dispossess and his finishing is top notch".&lt;ref name="hazard_fifa"/&gt; Hazard's frequent [[goal celebration]] saw him sliding on his knees; since 2018 he has stayed on his feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Eden Hazard has retired his trademark knee-slide celebration |url=https://talksport.com/football/430330/eden-hazard-trademark-knee-slide-celebration-chelsea/ |accessdate=9 October 2018 |agency=Talksport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hazard's favoured role is as a left winger, he is a versatile [[Forward (association football)|attacker]],&lt;ref name="Scheda giocatore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.corriere.it/mondiali/2014/gruppo-h/belgio/eden-hazard.shtml |title=Eden HAZARD |publisher=Il Corriere della Sera |language=Italian |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been deployed as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2654292-eden-hazards-real-madrid-brace-shows-he-can-be-chelseas-second-sriker |title=Eden Hazard's Real Madrid Brace Shows He Can Be Chelsea's 2nd Striker |publisher=bleacherreport.com |author1=Garry Hayes |date=31 July 2016 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|lone striker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/16/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report |title=Eden Hazard ensures Chelsea stay in touch at top with win at Brighton |work=The Guardian |first1=Dominic |last1=Fifield |date=16 December 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false-9]] on occasion throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/03/05/eden-hazard-reveals-frustration-false-nine-role-touching-ball/ |title=Eden Hazard reveals frustration with false-nine role after touching the ball 'three times' in Man City defeat |work=The Telegraph |date=5 March 2018 |accessdate=30 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond his speed, creativity, technical skills, and offensive qualities, he is also an accurate [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en/lists/premier-league-penalty-takers-man-utd-liverpool-man-city-all/e6aap0x4pt4q1jrg1gdjlk0dg |title=Premier League penalty takers: Man Utd, Liverpool, Man City &amp; all 20 clubs spot kick specialists |publisher=Goal.com |date=14 October 2018 |accessdate=17 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Direct free kick|free kick]] taker.&lt;ref name="Scheda giocatore"/&gt;

===Reception===

Hazard's pace, coupled with his finishing and ability to retain possession, led to his former coach [[Claude Puel]] dubbing him "little [[Lionel Messi|Messi]]", in reference to the [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] player.&lt;ref name="hazard_sportsillustrated"/&gt; Puel's sentiments were later echoed by former [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] manager and [[media personality]] [[Rolland Courbis]] who commented "At times it looks to me like Lionel Messi on the right-hand side".&lt;ref name="hazard_fourfourtwo"/&gt; Hazard's "flair and tricky" style of play has been described as being similar to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] player [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]; a comparison later repeated by former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Christophe Dugarry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The next Cristiano Ronaldo, Eden Hazard declares interest in sealing summer move to Arsenal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1215822/The-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Eden-Hazard-declares-sealing-summer-Arsenal.html|work=Daily Mail|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=19 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dugarry compare Eden Hazard à Cristiano Ronaldo |url=http://www.topfoot.com/5452,1/lille-dugarry-compare-eden-hazard-a-cristiano-ronaldo.html |publisher=Topfoot |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331065907/http://www.topfoot.com/5452%2C1/lille-dugarry-compare-eden-hazard-a-cristiano-ronaldo.html |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His vision, described as being the trait he has improved on the most, has also allowed him to develop into an effective passer,&lt;ref name="hazard_france24"&gt;{{cite news|title=Football: Eden Hazard, le Messi(e) de Lille |url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20110314-football-eden-hazard-le-messie-lille |work=[[France 24]] |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408120511/http://www.france24.com/fr/20110314-football-eden-hazard-le-messie-lille |archivedate=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, combined with his finishing ability, enables him to both score and create goals.&lt;ref name="next Messi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheda giocatore"/&gt;

In Belgium, Hazard's talent and similar ascension up the country's football hierarchy has led to comparisons to former Belgian international [[Enzo Scifo]].&lt;ref name="eden_hazard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hazard_scifo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enzo Scifo adoube son héritier: "Eden Hazard, c'est le talent"|url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/LOSC/2010/11/23/article_enzo-scifo-adoube-son-heritier-eden-haz.shtml|work=La Voix des Sports|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both players share the same birthplace and Scifo himself spent time with Hazard while he was in Tubize admitting "Eden, you know, I've coached in Tubize. During the week, I took care of the young people at least once, and he, in those days, I immediately saw he had a secure future".&lt;ref name="hazard_scifo"/&gt;

However, despite the positive opinions, Hazard has endured criticism from some. In 2010, former Belgium national team manager Georges Leekens questioned Hazard's work-rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium play down talk of Hazard spat|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/900525/belgium-play-down-talk-of-eden-hazard-spat|publisher=ESPN FC|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lille youth academy director Jean-Michel Vandamme countered both managers' criticism by arguing that Hazard simply possesses an intellectual honesty that is out of the ordinary and unexpected of today's footballer declaring "He is a real competitor, not a cheat, nor a moaner, because you don't hear him complaining when he gets fouled".&lt;ref name="hazard_fourfourtwo"/&gt;
