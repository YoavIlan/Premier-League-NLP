In 2012, he returned to Leeds for a short loan spell. Delph had a successful start to the [[2012–13 Premier League]] season, leading Villa manager [[Paul Lambert]] to call for his inclusion in the England squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Sky Sports |date=6 October 2013 |title=Paul Lambert wants Fabian Delph to get called-up by England |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12016/8960270/paul-lambert-wants-fabian-delph-to-get-called-up-by-england}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Delph joined Manchester City for £8 million.

====Early career====

On 17 April 2010, Delph had to be carried away from training on a stretcher after picking up a "serious" knee injury.

On 7 March, Delph scored the first goal as Villa defeated local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 2–0 to reach their first [[FA Cup semi-final]] since 2010.
