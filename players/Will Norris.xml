'''William James Norris''' (born 12 August 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

==Club career==
===Royston Town===
Without a club at the start of the 2011–12 season, Norris made an approach to join Hertfordshire side [[Royston Town F.C.|Royston Town]] who in the previous season had narrowly missed out on promotion after finishing 3rd in the [[Spartan South Midlands Football League|Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division]]. He played a number of games for the reserve team where his performances caught the attention of then first team manager, Paul Attfield, who pulled him into the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Norris: How an approach to Royston led to Cambridge United chance|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Norris-approach-Royston-led-Cambridge-United/story-28616792-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2011, he made his debut for Royston in a 4–1 home win against [[Haringey Borough F.C.|Haringey Borough]] in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match Report:Royston Town v Haringey Borough|url=http://www.roystontownfc.co.uk/match-reports/match-report-royston-town-v-haringey-borough-2/|publisher=[[Royston Town FC|roystontownfc.co.uk]]|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris went on to make 41 appearances in all competitions in 2011–12 helping the club to secure the Spartan South Midlands Premier Division title and a cup double which included the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division Cup and the South Midlands Floodlit Cup. In the quarter final of the [[Cambridgeshire Invitation Cup]] against [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]] on 25 January 2012, the game was decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] in which Norris pulled off a number of saves in [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] before scoring the winning penalty to send Royston into the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norris heroics send Crows into semis|url=http://www.royston-crow.co.uk/sport/royston-town-fc/norris_heroics_send_crows_into_semis_1_1189960|publisher=[[Royston Crow (newspaper)|Royston Crow]]|date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norris the hero for Royston|url=http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Norris-hero-Royston/story-21996134-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Hertfordshire Mercury]]|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge United===
On 16 July 2012, Norris signed for Cambridge United on a two-year deal and was loaned back to Royston Town for the duration of the 2012–13 season, helping the club to a 7th-place finish in the Southern Football League Division One Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge United sign teenage goalkeeper Will Norris|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18860112|publisher=[[BBC Sport|bbc.co.uk]]|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris spent the first half of the season 2013–14 with Cambridge as second choice to [[Chris Maxwell (footballer)|Chris Maxwell]], before re-joining Royston in December 2013 on a short-term loan spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge United goalkeeper Will Norris loaned to Royston|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge-United-goalkeeper-Norris-loaned-Royston-ahead-FA-Cup-showdown-Sheffield-United/story-22392060-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to make his first team debut for Cambridge in a 1–0 away win at [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] in the [[Conference Premier]] on 21 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Norris produced a 'mature' performance in Cambridge United's win over Tamworth|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Norris-produced-amature-performance-Cambridge-Uniteds-win-Tamworth-says-Richard-Money/story-22392075-detail/story.html|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]|date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2014, he signed a new contract with the club which extended his previous deal by two and a half years to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duo Sign New Deals|url=http://www.cambridge-united.co.uk/news/article/duosignnewdeals-1328305.aspx|publisher=Cambridge United F.C.|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make a total of 15 league appearances helping Cambridge make a return to [[The Football League]], after a nine-year absence, via the Conference play-offs. Norris kept a clean sheet in Cambridge's 4–0 victory over Gosport Borough in the [[2014 FA Trophy Final|2013–14 FA Trophy Final.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will can't wait for Wembley return in FA Trophy Final|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/competitions/fa-trophy/2014/mar/final-preview-will-norris-210314|publisher=[[The FA|thefa.com]]|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
