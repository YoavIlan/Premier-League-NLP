'''Neil Leonard Dula Etheridge''' (born 7 February 1990) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|CardiffC}} club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines national team]]. He joined the [[Fulham F.C. Academy|Fulham Academy]] after three years as a trainee at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and made his debut for Fulham in [[UEFA Europa League]] against Danish club [[Odense Boldklub]], though he never played in a league match with the club. While with Fulham from 2006 until 2014 he was loaned to various lower tier clubs; [[Leatherhead F.C.|Leatherhead]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].

After leaving Fulham, Etheridge signed with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] before he was loaned to Charlton Athletic. He joined Charlton on a permanent basis in 2015 after his contract with Oldham ended. After months of being without a club, Etheridge joined [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] making more than 90 appearances in all competitions in two seasons before moving to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club Cardiff City in 2017. 

After establishing himself as first choice goalkeeper, he helped the Welsh side win promotion to the Premier League and became the first Filipino player to play in the Premier League in August 2018. A former [[England national under-16 football team|England Schoolboys]] international, he now represents the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] at senior international level.

==Early life==
Etheridge was born in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], London to Englishman Martin Etheridge and Filipina Merlinda Dula, a native of [[Tarlac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/manila-times/20110110/281775625601086 |title=Etheridge: A man with vision for Philippine football |publisher=Philippine Index |author=Noguera, Emil C. |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |via=The Press Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer1&gt;{{cite news |first=Cedelf P. |last=Tupas |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080513-136168/Etheridges-goal-in-between-posts |title=Etheridge's goal in between posts |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006181430/http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080513-136168/Etheridges-goal-in-between-posts |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up football at the age of nine,&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt; initially playing as a left midfielder or striker before switching to playing as a goalkeeper in 2000 after volunteering to switch due to an injury to his youth side's regular goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="XI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/september/05/fulham-first-xi |title=Fulham first XI |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Court Moor School]] in [[Fleet, Hampshire]], where he also represented Hampshire Schools and the Aldershot &amp; Farnborough district teams.&lt;ref name=gethampshire1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/sport/other-sport/keeper-gets-england-call-5364885 |title=Keeper gets England call |work=Get Hampshire |date=11 October 2005 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216044124/http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/sport/other-sport/keeper-gets-england-call-5364885 |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Chelsea Academy===
Having played for local youth sides Cuffy Chiefs and Hart Boys,&lt;ref name="XI"/&gt; Etheridge began attending the [[Chelsea F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Chelsea Academy]] in 2003 at under-14 level,&lt;ref name=gethampshire1/&gt; where he was also teammates with eventual Philippine internationals [[James Younghusband|James]] and [[Phil Younghusband]]. He started out as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but eventually switched to playing as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at the suggestion of his coach.&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt;

===Fulham===
[[File:Neil Etheridge.jpg|thumb|upright|Etheridge training with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 2010]]

In 2006, he moved to local rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and signed professional terms for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fleethants.com/allfleethants/news/news2006.htm |title=20 July&amp;nbsp;– Dream Come True |work=Fleet Hampshire News |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etheridge signed for [[Isthmian League]] Division One South club [[Leatherhead F.C.|Leatherhead]] in September 2008 on loan for the entire 2008–09 season and made his debut on 20 September in the 2–1 home defeat to [[Metropolitan Police F.C.|Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-round-up-september-20-4827360 |title=Football round-up, September 20 |work=Get Surrey |author=Blackledge, Sam |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his loan spell, he received the first red card of his career, being sent off for dissent during a 2–1 defeat to [[Sittingbourne F.C.|Sittingbourne]] in a preliminary round of the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref name="XI"/&gt;

In September 2009, Etheridge underwent surgery on both knees after suffering from [[tendinitis]]. He was expected to be out for the entire [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]] but returned in January 2010, eventually making nine appearances for the reserves. By the end of the season he signed a new one-year deal, keeping him at Fulham until the summer of 2011, attributing his contract extension to his quick recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Cedelf P. |last=Tupas |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/sportsevents/sportsevents/view/20100625-277407/Fulham-FC-signs-goalie-Etheridge-to-extension |title=Fulham FC signs goalie Etheridge to extension |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702072759/http://sports.inquirer.net/sportsevents/sportsevents/view/20100625-277407/Fulham-FC-signs-goalie-Etheridge-to-extension |archivedate=2 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Etheridge received his first senior team call-up on 11 September 2010, when he was named on the substitute bench as cover for [[Mark Schwarzer]] in a home game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] due to an injury to regular second choice goalkeeper [[David Stockdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8977069.stm |title=Fulham v Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Etheridge joined [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on loan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/9418465.stm |title=Addicks sign young Fulham keeper Neil Etheridge |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was recalled six days later without playing for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/9426491.stm |title=Keeper Neil Etheridge recalled from Charlton by Fulham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etheridge signed a new contract in May that would extend his stay at [[Craven Cottage]] until the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/may/10/etheridge-contract-extension |title=Etheridge contract extension |publisher=Fulham F.C |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first senior appearance for Fulham against [[Odense Boldklub]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|2011–12]] [[UEFA Europa League]] on 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/match-centre/2011_2012/europa-league/group-k/home/odense-boldklub |title=Fulham 2–2 Odense BK |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 2012 upon his return to Fulham after completing his international duties, it was announced that Etheridge would be out for the rest of the season due to a wrist injury that was sustained in the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]]. He recovered quickly and on 9 May he has been able to play in the development squad's last game of the season against the reserves of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/may/29/summer-action |title=Summer action |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on an initial one-month loan on 20 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/september/20/etheridge-loan |title=Etheridge loan deal |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first [[English Football League|Football League]] appearance for Rovers against [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] on 22 September,  which was his and Rovers' first clean sheet of [[2012–13 Bristol Rovers F.C. season|2012–13 season]].&lt;ref name=sb1213/&gt; His arrival at the club coincided with an improvement in the club's form, leading to his loan deal being extended until December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/october/23/etheridge-extends-loan |title=Etheridge extends loan |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, Fulham confirmed that Etheridge had been recalled from his loan at Bristol Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2012/november/21/etheridge-recalled |title=Etheridge Recalled |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge signed a one-year extension to his Fulham contract on 8 May 2013, with the option of a further year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/may/08/etheridges-extension |title=Etheridge's Extension |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2013, he joined League One club [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on loan until 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/november/22/etheridge-joins-crewe |title=Etheridge Joins Crewe |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined the club once again on 25 February 2014 on loan until 13 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/february/25/etheridge-rejoins-crewe |title=Etheridge rejoins Crewe |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=25 February 2014 |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was recalled on 4 April by Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2014/april/04/etheridge-recalled |title=Etheridge Recalled |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[2013–14 in English football|2013–14 season]], he was released by Fulham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Premier League clubs submit retained and released lists |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504185633/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2013-14/may/premier-league-clubs-submit-retained-and-released-lists.html |archivedate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oldham Athletic and return to Charlton Athletic===
Following his release from Fulham, Etheridge used his own money to train with Charlton, one of his former loan clubs, where he knew the goalkeeping coach.

==International career==

===England youth===
Etheridge is a former [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16]] international, having played in the 2005 [[Victory Shield]],&lt;ref name=gethampshire1/&gt; in which England and Wales eventually shared the trophy. Despite having represented England at youth level, he remained eligible to represent the Philippines through his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/march/09/through-the-ranks |title=Through the ranks |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
====Early years====
In 2007, Etheridge received an invitation to play for the Philippines but declined the offer, citing unfamiliarity with the language and the players.&lt;ref name=headseast&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2008/april/10/etheridge-heads-east |title=Etheridge heads east |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again invited in early 2008, this time by the new [[Philippine Football Federation]] president [[Jose Mari Martinez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2008_April_29/4-fil-british-players-join/ai_n35373233/?tag=content;col1 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717221021/http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2008_April_29/4-fil-british-players-join/ai_n35373233/?tag=content;col1 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |title=4 Fil-British players join football team |format=reprint |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |publisher=Find Articles |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually accepted the invitation after speaking to the new manager and learning about the set up,&lt;ref name=headseast/&gt; and after encouragement from Chelsea youth teammate Phil Younghusband.&lt;ref name=inquirer1/&gt; He officially switched allegiance to the Philippines in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2008/october/09/international-action |title=International action |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full international debut against [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] in the [[2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualification|2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers]],&lt;ref name="Manila"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19741354 |title=Neil Etheridge's journey from Manila to the Memorial Stadium |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Christine |last=Chapman |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing in all three of his country's matches. He kept three clean sheets but the Philippines still failed to qualify due to an inferior [[goal difference]] to group winners [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/challenge-cup-previous-competitions/afc-challenge-cup-2008/19225 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203142226/http://www.the-afc.com/en/challenge-cup-previous-competitions/afc-challenge-cup-2008/19225 |archivedate=3 February 2013 |title=Tajikistan sail through |publisher=Asian Football Confederation |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 onward====
In 2010, Etheridge was named in the Philippines' squad for the [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]]. The Philippines came in second in their group, with one win and two draws, and conceding only one goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218230526/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_740267/Myanmar_0_Philippines_1_-_Filipinos_through_to_last_four |title=Myanmar 0 Philippines 0 – Filipinos through to last four |publisher=AFF Suzuki Cup |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But both legs of the semi-finals ended in 1–0 defeats for the Philippines against [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221113117/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_749660/Indonesia_1_Philippines_0_-_Gonzales_fires_Indonesia_into_final |title=Indonesia 1 Philippines 0 – Gonzales fires Indonesia into final |publisher=AFF Suzuki Cup |date=19 December 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then called up for his country for the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification|AFC Challenge Cup Qualifiers]] where he conceded only a single goal, enabling the Philippines to qualify for the group stage. Etheridge announced his interest to join the squad for the [[2012 AFC Challenge Cup]] but was originally in doubt to be included due to club commitments. However, after receiving clearance from Fulham to travel, he was included in the final 23-man squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/38217/out-of-it-all-neil-etheridge-stays-with-team |title=Out of it all, Neil Etheridge stays with team |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |last=Tupas |first=Cedelf |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2012 against [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]], he saved a penalty taken by [[Pak Song-chol (footballer, born 1991)|Pak Song-chol]] in the 16th minute as the match ended 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/37197/spirited-azkals-yield-by-just-2-to-north-koreans |title=Spirited Azkals yield by just 2 to North Koreans |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author=Tupas, Cedelf |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[sent off]] in the closing minutes of the semi-final match against [[Turkmenistan national football team|Turkmenistan]], which the Philippines lost 2–1.

[[File:Neil e gk.jpg|thumb|upright|Etheridge during a match against Singapore]]

In August 2014, Etheridge was not included in the training squad for the 2014 Peace Cup, which also serves as the country's preliminary squad for the [[2014 AFF Championship|2014 AFF Suzuki Cup]], due to a lack of first team club football. He labelled manager [[Thomas Dooley]] "disrespectful" over the omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/football/azkals-coach-thomas-dooley-also-criticizes-neil-etheridge |title=Azkals coach Dooley answers Neil Etheridge 'disrespectful' rant over Peace Cup snub |website=spin.ph |last=Sacamos |first=Karlo |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, it was announced that Etheridge would not be included in the [[2016 AFF Championship]] squad, because of club commitments with Walsall.
