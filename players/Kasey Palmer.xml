==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Palmer joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] at the age of nine, and featured for the club for the majority of his youth career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3524622/Kasey-Palmer-impressed-Chelsea-21s-nutmegged-Phil-Jones-youngster-looking-force-way-Guus-Hiddink-s-team-plans.html|title=Kasey Palmer impressed for Chelsea U 21s, but who is the youngster?|website=Mail Online|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having represented his nation at youth level, Palmer attracted interest from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and made the move in March 2013. Due to their academy status, the Blues were able to sign Palmer for only a small compensation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2306844/Kasey-Palmer-cost-Chelsea-800-000-Charlton-move.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: New-signing Palmer could cost Chelsea £800k after move from Charlton|website=Mail Online|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making a handful of appearances for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-18s]] during the remainder of his inaugural season, Palmer became an influential figure in [[Adrian Viveash]]'s side for the 2013–14 while making sporadic appears from the bench for the [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-19s]] and [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|Under-21s]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/development-squad/under-21s/u21-player-profiles/kasey-palmer.html|title=Kasey Palmer|website=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first success came with the Under-21s, when he made appearances in the semi-final and final of the end-of-season playoffs before [[Dermot Drummy]]'s team were named league champions. He later featured as a substitute in every round of the club’s successful [[FA Youth Cup]] campaign while netting twice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He also played in all four [[UEFA Youth League]] knockout ties, while scoring against [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit St Petersburg]] in the second round before the Blues lifted the cup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2015–16 season also proved successful for Palmer, who scored three goals in five matches as they retained their crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10248901/paris-saint-german-1-2-chelsea-blues-retain-uefa-youth-league-crown|title=Paris Saint-Germain 1–2 Chelsea: Blues retain UEFA Youth League crown|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipped as one of the academy's most promising talents, Palmer signed a new contract in February 2016, which committed his future to the club until the end of the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BBS4DysNLUr/|title=Instagram photo by Kasey Palmer • Feb 2, 2016 at 7:03pm UTC|website=Instagram|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given his first taste of senior football under manager [[Guus Hiddink]], being named as an unused substitute against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35949311|title=Swansea City 1–0 Chelsea|last=Stadium|first=Dafydd Pritchard BBC Wales Sport at the Liberty|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
