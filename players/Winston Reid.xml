Reid also established himself in the starting eleven throughout the season until Reid left the club.

=== West Ham United ===

==== 2010–11 season ====
Reid signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 5 August 2010, on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref name="west ham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100805/reid-signs_2236884_2112684 |title=Reid signs |publisher=West Ham United Official Website |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921085430/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100805/reid-signs_2236884_2112684 |archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=811998&amp;sec=transfers&amp;cc=5739 |title=Hammers sign All Whites international Reid |date=5 August 2010 |work=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His transfer fee was the subject of a dispute between West Ham United and FC Midtjylland as West Ham withheld the fee to bring to [[UEFA]]'s attention fees owing to them from the sale of [[Alessandro Diamanti]] to [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham refuse to pay Winston Reid transfer due to bitter dispute with Fifa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/8823344/West-Ham-refuse-to-pay-Winston-Reid-transfer-due-to-bitter-dispute-with-Fifa.html |publisher=Telegraph |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut on 14 August, in a 3–0 loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darling |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8906162.stm |title=BBC Sport&amp;nbsp;– Football&amp;nbsp;– Aston Villa 3–0 West Ham |publisher=BBC News |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored his first goal for the club in a 5–1 win against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the Fifth Round of the [[FA Cup]] on 21 February 2011.&lt;ref name="WHUGoal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/9404702.stm |title=Winston Reid sympathises with New Zealand quake victims |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |author=Leon Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season for West Ham United Reid's first team opportunities were limited, making just 12 appearances in all competitions as the club was relegated.

==== 2011–12 season ====
For the 2011–2012 season Reid stayed at West Ham following relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], and scored his first league goal for West Ham United in a 4–1 away win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottingham Forest 1&amp;nbsp;– 4 West Ham United Match Report |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110828/nottm-forest-1-west-ham-4_2234233_57971 |publisher=WHFC Official Website |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid also scored the winning goal against arch-rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in a 2–1 home win on 4 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham United 2&amp;nbsp;– 1 Millwall Match Report |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120204/west-ham-2-millwall-1_2234233_59529 |publisher=WHFC Official Website |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham finished the season by winning the [[2012 Football League Championship play-off Final|Football League play-offs]] against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], and gaining promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

==== 2012–13 season ====
In summer 2012, Reid opted to stay and train with his West Ham teammates ahead of the new Premier League season rather than represent [[New Zealand at the 2012 Summer Olympics#Men's tournament 2|New Zealand]] at the London Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/west-ham-defender-winston-reid-chooses-club-over-country-as-he-turns-down-olympics-7869151.html |title=West Ham defender Winston Reid chooses club over country as he turns down Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Football&amp;nbsp;– Sport&amp;nbsp;– London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first ever Premier League goal in West Ham's 3–0 victory against Fulham on 1 September 2012, and in May 2013 Reid signed a two-year extension to his contact until the end of the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Winston Reid inks two-year deal at West Ham |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/8616509/Winston-Reid-inks-two-year-deal-at-West-Ham |publisher=www.stuff.co.nz |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his best season since joining the club, Reid was rewarded for his form on 8 May 2013 when he was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]], as West Ham went on to finish the season in 10th.&lt;ref name=Hoty&gt;{{cite web |title=Reid crowned Hammer of the Year |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/reid-crowned-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_3172136 |publisher=Www.whufc.com |accessdate=9 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511115924/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/reid-crowned-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_3172136 |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013–14 season ====
Reid scored the opening goal in a 3–0 away win against rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in October 2013. However, in November 2013 he suffered an ankle injury in training which required surgery. He made his return in February 2014 in a 2–0 home win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Soccerbase season|49688|2013|access-date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20131106/reid-injured_2236884_3526767 |title=Reid injured |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203234221/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20131106/reid-injured_2236884_3526767 |archivedate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20131122/winston-reid-update_2236884_3540685 |title=Winston Reid update |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140201/west-ham-united-2-0-swansea-city-ft_2236884_3648687 |title=West Ham 2–0 Swansea |publisher=www.whufc.com |accessdate=2 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202135628/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20140201/west-ham-united-2-0-swansea-city-ft_2236884_3648687 |archivedate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid made his 100th appearance for West Ham in all competitions on 15 April, in a 1–3 defeat away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

==== 2014–15 season ====
On 20 September, Reid scored the first goal after just two minutes in a 3–1 win against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Upton Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187275 |title=West Ham United 3–1 Liverpool |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Reid signed a new six-and-a-half year contract with West Ham, after much speculation over his future at the club, after being linked with London rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref name="sixandahalf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31744884 |title=Winston Reid: West Ham defender signs six-and-a-half-year deal |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2016, Reid wrote his name into West Ham United folklore, when he scored the last ever goal at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] in a 3–2 win against [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/reid-thrills-boleyn-shred-man-utd-top-four-215126320--sow.html;_ylt=AwrEWDbLWzJXuDcARydXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEybDZvZ21uBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDQjIwNDZfMQRzZWMDc2M- |title=Violence, drama as Man Utd's top-four hopes shredded |publisher= |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
{{update|section|date=July 2016}}
Reid received Danish [[citizenship]] in 2006&lt;ref name="west ham"/&gt; and was subsequently called up for the [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19 national team]]. He played for various Danish age-grade representative teams, in particular the under-19s and [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21s]], and played in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs|2009 European Under-21 Championship qualification]] tournament.

On 11 March 2010, Reid stated that he wanted to play for the senior [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand team]],&lt;ref name="3News_145900"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/All-Whites-bolster-ranks-with-Danish-star-Winston-Reid/tabid/415/articleID/145900/Default.aspx |title=All Whites bolster ranks with Danish star Winston Reid |author=Gourdie, Andrew |date=11 March 2010 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 March 2010 he made himself available for New Zealand's [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] selection.&lt;ref name=commits&gt;{{cite web |author=Woodcock, Fred |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/3443252/Reid-changes-mind-commits-to-All-Whites |title=Reid changes mind, commits to All Whites |work=The Dominion Post |date=13 March 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2010, Reid was included in New Zealand's 2010 World Cup squad even though New Zealand national coach [[Ricki Herbert]] had never seen him play.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnstone |first=Duncan |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/world-cup/3676399/All-Whites-World-Cup-squad-named |title=All Whites World Cup squad named |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his international debut in a friendly against [[Australia national football team|Australia]] in [[Melbourne]] two weeks later. His second appearance came in the All Whites' shock 1–0 victory over [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], leaving Ricki Herbert "suitably impressed" with Reid's performance,&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3756323"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/fifa-world-cup/all-whites/3756323/A-real-downer-for-Serb-fans-in-dress-rehearsal |title=A real downer for Serb fans in dress rehearsal |author=Smith, Tony |date=31 May 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplanting [[Ben Sigmund]] on the right side of Herbert's three-man defence.

On 15 June 2010, Reid scored an equalising goal in stoppage time against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup, thus securing a draw as well as his first ever international goal and New Zealand's first ever point in a World Cup finals match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_12 New Zealand 1–1 Slovakia] ''BBC Sport'', 15 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2010, Winston picked up his first international red card against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in [[Wellington]] for a "vicious"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Worthington |first=Sam |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/4230397/No-serious-damage-for-Winston-Reids-victim |title=No serious damage for Winston Reid's victim |publisher=The Dominion Post |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studs-up tackle on striker [[Federico Santander]] in the 90th minute of the [[New Zealand national football team|All Whites']] 2–0 defeat.

Following the retirement of [[Ryan Nelsen]] from international football in 2013, Winston Reid was named captain of the All Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/8450714/Winston-Reid-named-All-Whites-captain |title=Winston Reid named new All Whites captain |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013 |first=Tony |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November 2013, Reid was ruled out of the All Whites' FIFA World Cup playoff against Mexico, not only leaving a void on defense, but also with his successor as captain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11152966 |title=Key questions: What now for Reid-less All Whites? |date=7 November 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=15 January 2017 |via=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2017, Reid has won 23 caps for his country.
