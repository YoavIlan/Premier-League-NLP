Miazga started playing more frequently during the 2014 season. Also, in August 2014, he signed an endorsement deal with [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] and played in the [[Major League Soccer Homegrown Game]].&lt;ref name=nj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanmyre|first1=Matthew|title=NJ's Matt Miazga, Red Bulls rookie, living dream from mom and dad's at 19|url=http://www.nj.com/redbulls/index.ssf/2014/08/livin_the_dream_from_home_local_kid_matt_miazga_making_mark_with_red_bulls.html|accessdate=April 9, 2016|publisher=NJ.com|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miazga made his [[CONCACAF Champions League]] debut in a 1–1 draw against the [[Montreal Impact]] on October 22.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concacaf.com/category/champions-league/game-detail/203204&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 season, Miazga established himself as a starter for the club, forming a partnership in the backline with [[Damien Perrinelle]]. He was sent off for two bookings in a 2–1 victory against [[New York City FC]] in the first ever [[Hudson River Derby]] match on May 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RED CARD: Matt Miazga is sent off in the first half after a second yellow card|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/05/10/red-card-matt-miazga-sent-first-half-after-second-yellow-card|accessdate=April 9, 2016|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, he scored his first goal as a professional in a 3–1 derby victory over the same opponents at [[Yankee Stadium]].
