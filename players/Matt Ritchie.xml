'''Matthew Thomas Ritchie''' (born 10 September 1989) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. He previously played for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]]. He joined Newcastle United in 2016.

Born and raised in England, Ritchie qualified to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] through his Scottish father. He made his senior international debut on 25 March 2015, in a friendly match against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].

==Club career==
===Portsmouth===
Ritchie had been involved in Portsmouth's academy since he turned 13, previously playing football locally in Gosport, starting at the age of six.&lt;ref name="Ritchie in dream land"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie in dream land|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-in-dream-land-1-1299296|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing his first professional contract with the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&amp;qs_article_id=1315 |title=Portsmouth Football Club :: News |publisher=Portsmouthfc.co.uk |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728052519/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/index.php?cms_ref=news&amp;qs_article_id=1315 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a positive 2008–09 pre-season campaign, including a [[hat-trick]] in a 4–1 victory over hometown club [[Gosport Borough F.C.|Gosport Borough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3967462,00.html |title=Sky Sports &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Pompey see off Gosport |publisher=Skysports.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the match, Ritchie said scoring a hat-trick was 'unreal'.&lt;ref name="Ritchie in dream land"/&gt;

He went on loan to Swindon Town in 2010 but due to Portsmouth's mounting injury list, he was recalled in March and was named on the bench for their 2–0 [[Premier League]] loss at the hands of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] after making four appearances for Swindon. On 14 April, he made his League debut for Portsmouth in the game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. He played 79 minutes but was then substituted for [[Frédéric Piquionne]]. After the match, Ritchie admits making his Portsmouth debut was a dream come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie: It was a dream come true|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-it-was-a-dream-come-true-1-1249529|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=15 February 2010|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, with Portsmouth's relegation from the Premier League confirmed, he signed a new two-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie set for Pompey stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6221148/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2010–11 Football League|2010–11]] season, Ritchie was handed the number 5 shirt and was selected in Portsmouth's starting XI for their first match of the season at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8881422.stm|title=BBC Sport – Football – Coventry 2–0 Portsmouth|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon found himself out of the Portsmouth line-up and, with the club having disbanded its reserve team, manager [[Steve Cotterill]] agreed to loan out the player for fitness reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/frattonlatest/Cotterill-Ritchie-has-a-Blues.6574341.jp|title=Cotterill: Ritchie has a Blues future|website=www.portsmouth.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge====
Ritchie played reserve and academy football at Pompey until late September and continued to impress until he was taken on a one-month loan deal by [[Football League Two|League Two]] club [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/7636244.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; My Club &amp;#124; Dagenham &amp; Redbridge &amp;#124; Daggers bring in Ritchie on loan |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Football League debut against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 27 September 2008, coming on as a late substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7626803.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Dag &amp; Red 1–1 Rotherham |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie scored on his first competitive start for the ''Daggers'' in a 2–0 win over [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7639346.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Rochdale 0–2 Dag &amp; Red |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=4 October 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored again in his next match, a 2–0 win over [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7646415.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; League Two &amp;#124; Dag &amp; Red 2–0 Barnet |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritchie also made clear his wishes to extend the loan deal until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1782_4344933,00.html |title=Daggers boss keen on Ritchie stay |publisher=Teamtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021174750/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0%2C16368%2C1782_4344933%2C00.html |archivedate=21 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagenham announced on 30 December that the player would remain with the club until the end of the current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/7804737.stm | work=BBC News | title=Daggers extend Ritchie loan spell | date=30 December 2008 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His impressive performances saw him rewarded with a new two-year deal at Portsmouth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_5262599,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Pompey offer Ritchie new deal | date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their Young Player of the Season Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hat-trick of honours for Johnson|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/hat-trick-of-honours-for-johnson-1-1232220|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=20 May 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Notts County====
On 28 July 2009, it was reported that [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], were in talks with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] over a six-figure fee for his services, believed to be £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magpies plan Ritchie raid|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/5459759/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 July 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2009, Ritchie signed on loan until 31 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magpies swoop for Ritchie|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/5530180/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 September 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although County wanted to extend his loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie wants Magpies stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/5700069/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan to Swindon and permanent basis===
After [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] failed to secure Ritchie's services on a permanent deal during the transfer window, it was announced on 11 February 2010 that [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] had signed the midfielder on loan for the remainder of the [[2009–10 in English football|season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/headlines/5001709.BREAKING_NEWS__Town_land_Ritchie/ Town land Ritchie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213213509/http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/headlines/5001709.BREAKING_NEWS__Town_land_Ritchie/ |date=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 February against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] after coming on for [[Danny Ward (English footballer)|Danny Ward]] after 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8496999.stm | work=BBC News | title=Swindon 4–1 Stockport | date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making a brief appearance for Pompey on 4 October, Ritchie was loaned again to Swindon Town, on a one-month deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Ritchie-Loaned-To-Swindon-1459.aspx Ritchie loaned to Swindon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007070023/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Ritchie-Loaned-To-Swindon-1459.aspx |date=7 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later the deal was extended to two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/9101408.stm|title=BBC Sport – Football – Swindon extend loan of Portsmouth winger Matt Ritchie|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2011, Swindon Town signed Ritchie on a two-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He added to his tally with goals against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] in a 3–2 loss, a 4–1 loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], a 1–1 draw with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and a 2–1 loss against Notts County. Despite Swindon Town being relegated to League Two, Ritchie was named the Robins' Player of the Season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie wins Swindon Town's player of the year|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/9474972.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 May 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under manager [[Paolo Di Canio]] in League Two, he retained his first team place in the starting eleven and scoring form with ten goals that season. During the season, Ritchie was linked with League One clubs, with the likes of Bournemouth interested in signing the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bournemouth fail in bid for Swindon Town's Matt Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15870897|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bournemouth's bid for him was rejected, manager Di Canio said that he was worth about £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Di Canio puts £2m price tag on Swindon Town's Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15895163|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March, he won the Football League Two Player of the Year for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ritchie scoops League Two honour|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/pompey/ritchie-scoops-league-two-honour-1-3616685|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With teammate [[Paul Caddis]] he was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year.&lt;ref name=PFATOTY1112&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17797832 |title=Arsenal striker Robin van Persie named PFA Player of the Year |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of a new season in League One, Swindon turned down a £900,000 offer from a League One club for Ritchie, insisting he would be sold for £2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swindon Town turn down new bid for Matt Ritchie|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18883762|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie signs Swindon Town contract extension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19523943|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 January 2013, Ritchie signed for AFC Bournemouth on a three-and-a-half year deal for £400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21265257|title=Matt Ritchie: Bournemouth sign Swindon Town winger|date=30 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8457035/League-One-Bournemouth-have-signed-winger-Matt-Ritchie-from-Swindon "League One: Bournemouth have signed winger Matt Ritchie from Swindon"] Sky Sports. 30 January 2013. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Swindon Town, he said that he was surprised to leave the club and that he had left with a "heavy heart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matt Ritchie: Swindon exit saddens Bournemouth winger|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21286981|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Di Canio claimed that the club sold Ritchie behind his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio: Swindon Town manager 'considers future'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21300099|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut on 2 February in a 3–0 win over [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]. Ritchie scored his first goal for his new team on 23 March in a 4–1 win over [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. That win was the first of an eight match run of successive wins, including a brace for Ritchie in a 3–1 victory over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], that culminated in clinching promotion to the Championship.&lt;ref name="sb1213" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchener|first1=Mark|title=Bournemouth 3 – 1 Carlisle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22133176|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 April 2015|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a key performer for Bournemouth during the 2014–15 season. His form helped the side to top the Championship and won him international recognition with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. By April, he had scored 11 goals and provided 13 assists for his team. Ritchie's form saw him voted the [[Football League]]'s best player in a poll by ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cusick|first1=Aiden|title=Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie Tops Four Four Two's Football League Top 50 Poll|url=http://www.90min.com/posts/2017319-bournemouth-s-matt-ritchie-tops-fourfourtwo-s-football-league-top-50-poll|publisher=90 Minutes|accessdate=3 April 2015|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2015, he scored his first ever goal in the [[Premier League]], coming on for Bournemouth in a 2–0 home win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bournemouth 2–0 Sunderland|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34191881|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2015, Ritchie scored his team's only goal of the game after just 1 minute, in Bournemouth's 5–1 drubbing by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bournemouth 1–5 Tottenham Hotspur|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34564964|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2016, Ritchie signed a five-year contract with newly relegated [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], becoming the third signing under manager [[Rafael Benítez]].&lt;ref name="Ritchie Signs On At St. James' Park"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160701/ritchie-signs-on-at-st-james-park_2281670_5696102 | title=Ritchie Signs On At St. James' Park | publisher=Newcastle United | date=1 July 2016 | accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], playing the full 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36921094|title=Fulham 1–0 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal, a penalty, came two matches later in a 4–1 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37030439|title=Newcastle United 4–1 Reading|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 August 2016|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, Ritchie would become the club's designated penalty taker and had a 100% success rate in all competitions, converting from the spot five times. He was involved in two penalty related incidents over the course of the season. On 25 October, he refused to hand the ball to [[Aleksandar Mitrović (footballer)|Aleksandar Mitrović]], tucking it under his shirt, before scoring the third goal in a 6–0 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37686639|title=Newcastle United 6–0 Preston North End|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 2017, against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]], Ritchie scored a penalty, but it was not awarded due to encroachment by [[Dwight Gayle]]. However, referee [[Keith Stroud]] awarded a direct free kick to Burton, rather than allowing Ritchie to retake the penalty. Ultimately, it did not matter as he scored the winner anyway, to keep Newcastle in the promotion hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39426682|title=Newcastle 1–0 Burton Albion|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie's season was ended by suspension, when he argued with a match official after a home draw with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39735735|title=Matt Ritchie: Newcastle United winger misses rest of season through suspension|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 April 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie scored sixteen goals in all competitions, with only Gayle having netted more than the Scotsman.

On 26 August, Ritchie assisted [[Ciaran Clark]] for the second goal of the match, as Newcastle got their first win of the season, beating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40984016|title=Newcastle United 3–0 West Ham United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 August 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then credited with the assists for the goals scored by [[Jamaal Lascelles]] and [[Christian Atsu]] in wins over [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41139095|title=Swansea City 0–1 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 September 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41210052|title=Newcastle United 2–1 Stoke City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 September 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November, he assisted both Newcastle goals from set-pieces in a 2–2 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41210052|title=West Bromwich Albion 2–2 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 November 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the season, Ritchie scored three times, all in home wins over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42934988|title=Newcastle United 1–0 Manchester United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43267239|title=Newcastle United 3–0 Southampton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43686474|title=Newcastle United 2–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 April 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2018, Ritchie set up [[Joselu]] for the equaliser, in a 2–1 home loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45067372|title=Newcastle United 1–2 Tottenham Hotspur|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken off in the second half, much to his disapproval; his emotional outburst on the bench was captured on television cameras, and was discussed on the following night's "2 Good 2 Bad" segment on ''[[Match of the Day 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/11/matt-ritchie-goes-ballistic-newcastle-bench-subbed-off-tottenham-7827421|title=Matt Ritchie goes ballistic on Newcastle bench after being subbed off against Tottenham|work=Metro|date=11 August 2018|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November, Ritchie assisted Clark for the second goal of the match in a 2–1 away win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], although in the second half, he missed a sitter from two yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46256914|title=Burnley 1–2 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 November 2018|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Under [[FIFA eligibility rules]], Ritchie was eligible for the national teams of England, where he was born and raised, and Scotland, his father's native land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31909618|title=Matt Ritchie: Bournemouth winger's joy at Scotland call-up|date=16 March 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2015, he was called up to the [[Scotland national football team]] for a friendly against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualification|qualifier]] against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]]. Ritchie made his debut against Northern Ireland on 25 March at [[Hampden Park]], and took the 85th-minute corner which set up [[Christophe Berra]]'s header for the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scotland 1–0 Northern Ireland|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/31917339|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June he scored his first international goal, a 20-yard strike which was the only goal of a friendly victory over [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] at [[Easter Road]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamont|first1=Alasdair|title=Scotland 1–0 Qatar|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32926060|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came in a European Championship qualifier against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at Hampden Park on 8 October 2015, for which he won "Goal of the Year" award from the [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish FA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14133215.Matt_Ritchie_wins_Scotland_Goal_of_the_Year/?ref=rss |title=AFC Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie wins Scotland Goal of the Year from Scottish FA |work=Daily Echo |publisher= |date=9 December 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
