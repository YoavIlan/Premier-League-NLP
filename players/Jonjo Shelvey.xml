First, he kicked the ball away in the 24th minute, then in the 72nd minute, he blocked [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]]'s run, resulting in the second booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanghera |first=Mandeep |title=Everton 0–0 Swansea |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29768011 |accessdate=2 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, he caught Liverpool's [[Emre Can]] with his arm during a 4–1 away defeat. Although referee [[Andre Marriner]] did not punish him for it, [[the Football Association]] later gave Shelvey a four-match suspension for violent conduct, with one match having been added to the suspension because of his previous dismissal against Everton. He claimed that the act was unintentional and personally apologised to Can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Swansea midfielder gets four-match ban for Can clash |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30634753 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the Liverpool match, Swansea manager [[Garry Monk]] criticised Shelvey's disciplinary record, telling him to "wise up" and put a stop to an accumulation of yellow cards earned through "laziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Swansea midfielder must wise up, says Garry Monk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30620866 |accessdate=1 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Shelvey signed a new, four-year deal with the Swans, which would have kept him at the club until the summer of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shelvey signs new Swans contract |url=https://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/jonjo-shelvey-signs-new-swansea-city-contract-2533483.aspx |publisher=Swansea City A.F.C. |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2016, following a shock 3–2 defeat to League Two team [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the [[2015–16 FA Cup#Third Round Proper|FA Cup]], Shelvey appeared to become embroiled in a row with one Swansea fan and then appeared to invite the man to meet him outside. Manager [[Alan Curtis (footballer)|Alan Curtis]] responded stating "we expect more from Jonjo, it is as simple as that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey in angry confrontation with fan after cup defeat |url=http://www.espnfc.com/swansea-city/story/2784480/swansea-jonjo-shelvey-in-angry-confrontation-with-fan |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=12 January 2016 |date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
On 12 January 2016, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] announced they had signed Shelvey on a five-and-a-half-year deal, for a reported fee of £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newcastle sign Shelvey |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160112/newcastle-sign-shelvey_2281670_5268851 |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |accessdate=12 January 2016 |date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Newcastle sign Swansea midfielder for £12m |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35290127 |date=12 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later he made his debut in a 2–1 Premier League victory over West Ham United, the first win for the club in seven matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey shines in Newcastle debut win but could face FA action |url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/jonjo-shelvey-shines-in-newcastle-debut-win-but-could-face-fa-action-34370240.html |newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin |accessdate=16 January 2016 |date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named [[man of the match]] for his involvement in the build-up to both of Newcastle's goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey made an impressive debut for Newcastle as he helped his team move out of the relegation zone with a win over West Ham |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35270693 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=16 January 2016 |date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Newcastle were on a training break in [[La Manga]] on 20 February, manager [[Steve McClaren]] announced that Shelvey had been made the team's captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=James |title=Newcastle announce shock new captain |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/645920/Newcastle-Jonjo-Shelvey-captain-Premier-League-news |accessdate=20 February 2016 |newspaper=Daily Express |location=London |date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served the role as [[Fabricio Coloccini]] stayed out through a calf injury, and said that he wanted to help the club avoid relegation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Stand-in Newcastle United captain wants to inspire safety push |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35729286 |accessdate=11 May 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were unsuccessful in that aim.

Shelvey scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 27 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37138687 |title=Newcastle 2–0 Brighton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Shelvey was banned for five matches after being found guilty of using racially abusive language towards [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] player, [[Romain Saïss]], in a match on 17 September 2016. He was also fined £100,000 and ordered to attend a [[Football Association]] education course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38366883 |title=Jonjo Shelvey: Newcastle United midfielder handed five-game racial abuse ban |date=20 December 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 47 appearances and scored 5 goals in [[2016–17 Newcastle United F.C. season|2016–17]]&lt;ref name=sb1617/&gt; as Newcastle were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=1502 |title=Championship: 2016/17: Latest table |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the new season, Shelvey changed his squad number from 12 to 8. On 13 August 2017, in Newcastle United's first match back in the Premier League against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Shelvey was sent off three minutes into the second half of the match, for stamping on Tottenham midfielder [[Dele Alli]]. Newcastle would go on to lose the match 2–0, with Shelvey later apologising for his violent conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/10987259/jonjo-shelvey-has-apologised-for-red-card-says-rafa-benitez |title=Jonjo Shelvey has apologised for red card, says Rafa Benitez |publisher=Sky Sports |date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Jonjo Shelvey and Jordan Henderson.jpg|thumb|upright|Shelvey (left) playing for [[England national under-21 football team|England U21s]] in 2012]]

===Youth===
Shelvey captained the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16s]] as they won the [[2007 Victory Shield]] scoring three goals in three matches. He played a key role in the Montaigu Tournament, which England won for the first time in seven years, playing in all four matches and scoring a free kick in the final against France.{{cn|date=April 2017}} In October 2008, he made his debut for the [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17s]] and scored in a 7–0 win over [[Estonia national youth football team|Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lions hit seven |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/Mens-u17s/news/2009/u17s_estonia_report |publisher=The Football Association |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his debut for the [[England national under-19 football team|England under-19s]], in September 2010, he captained and scored a free-kick in a 2–0 win over Slovakia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liverpool lads fire Lions to victory |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u19s/News/Match%20Centre/England%20v%20Slovakia |publisher=The Football Association |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed up by scoring on his following two appearances for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Six of the best |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u19s/News/Match%20Centre/England%20v%20Albania |publisher=The Football Association |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shelvey on target for England |url=http://www.Liverpool.tv/news/latest-news/shelvey-on-target-for-england |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his first Under-21 cap coming on as substitute in a 6–0 win against [[Azerbaijan national under-21 football team|Azerbaijan]] in September 2011.&lt;ref name=u21debut&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Al |title=Henderson scores for Under 21's |url=http://www.lfconline.com/news/tmnw/henderson_scores_for_under_21s_698655/index.shtml |publisher=lfconline.com |accessdate=7 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506202424/http://www.lfconline.com/news/tmnw/henderson_scores_for_under_21s_698655/index.shtml |archivedate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's senior manager [[Roy Hodgson]] claimed that Shelvey missed the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] because he was "reticent" about playing at that level following his senior international debut. Shelvey responded by saying that he had been told by under-21 manager [[Gareth Southgate]] that he would not feature in that squad, and claimed that if he had ever refused international duty he would have faced the wrath of his father.&lt;ref name=snub&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey denies snubbing England U21 duty |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/9976526/jonjo-shelvey-denies-snubbing-england-u21-duty |accessdate=12 January 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
Shelvey was eligible to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] – through his grandfather – and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/dundee-united/278956-craig-levein-wants-liverpool-starlet-to-switch-to-scotland/ "Craig Levein wants Liverpool starlet to switch to Scotland"]. sport.stv.tv. Retrieved 22 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but chose to represent England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.herald.ie/sport/soccer/shelvey-spurns-ireland-despite-promise-of-cap-oshea-happy-at-blues-27928317.html |title=Shelvey spurns Ireland despite promise of cap O'Shea happy at Blues |newspaper=The Herald |location=Dublin |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 Shelvey was called up for the [[England national football team|England]] squad for two [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England call-ups for Jonjo Shelvey and Ryan Bertrand |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19860360 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his senior debut from the bench on 12 October 2012, in a 5–0 home win against San Marino, replacing [[Michael Carrick]] in the 66th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England 5–0 San Marino |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19860360 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2015, Shelvey was selected to start for England for the first time in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match against San Marino, becoming the first man to be capped for England whilst playing for Swansea City. He was named man of the match by the [[BBC]] as England ran out 6–0 winners in [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34165282 |title=San Marino v England: How the players rated |date=5 September 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shelvey was born in [[Romford]], London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/players/jonjo-shelvey-228577/ |title=Jonjo Shelvey |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in a council flat in [[Harold Hill]]. Due to crime in the neighbourhood, he bought his sister a home in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] when she became pregnant. His older brother George was, according to Shelvey, a better footballer, but his career was ruined by drinking and partying.&lt;ref name=rough&gt;{{cite news |last=James |first=Stuart |title=Jonjo Shelvey: 'Growing up it was rough, people were getting stabbed' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/20/jonjo-shelvey-swansea-city-interview |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelvey fell down a staircase as a baby, one of several childhood traumas which he believes could have caused the [[alopecia]] which caused his hair loss. He was prescribed a cream and told to sleep in a woolly hat for a month in order to combat it, but abandoned treatment because of the discomfort it caused, and said of his baldness, "If you don't like it, don't talk to me".&lt;ref name=rough/&gt; Shelvey has supported youngsters who share his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Richman |first=Darren |title=Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey gives young alopecia sufferer day to remember after receiving heartfelt letter |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/11125000/Swanseas-Jonjo-Shelvey-gives-young-alopecia-sufferer-day-to-remember-after-receiving-heartfelt-letter.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Shelvey married Daisy Evans, formerly of the pop group [[S Club 8]]. Comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] performed at the event. The couple have a daughter, born the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jonjo Shelvey marries Daisy Evans in lavish ceremony with helicopter entrance and Jimmy Carr show |url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Jonjo-Shelvey-marries-Daisy-Evans-lavish-ceremony/story-26743379-detail/story.html |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=South Wales Evening Post |location=Swansea |date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his marriage, Shelvey advertised for a live-in chef, who would receive an annual salary of £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graves |first=Steve |title=Jonjo Shelvey advertises for chef on £65,000 a year |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jonjo-shelvey-advertises-chef-65000-9657234 |accessdate=12 January 2016 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that his family responsibilities and new diet would improve his professional behaviour.&lt;ref name=snub/&gt;
