'''Aaron James Ramsey''' (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]]. Ramsey mainly plays as a [[box-to-box midfielder]], but has also been deployed on the left and right [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]]. He played as a schoolboy for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 22 appearances for the senior team&amp;nbsp;– including the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].

Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a £5&amp;nbsp;million deal, where he quickly gained first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]]. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]] campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. He also played in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], which Arsenal won,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio_Estero/Premierleague/13-02-2012/ramsey-macabra-statistica-se-segna-muore-famoso-81326265995.shtml |title=Ramsey, macabra statistica Se segna muore un vip |first=Simona |last=Marchetti |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 February 2012 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live |title=Arsenal 2–1 Chelsea |date=28 May 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will join [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 1 July 2019 after having signed a pre-contractual agreement.

Ramsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their [[UEFA Euro 2016]] campaign, where he helped his nation to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament. He also represented [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]].

==Early life==

After impressing in an [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru|Urdd]] tournament as a youngster he signed for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], who beat off competition from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], as a schoolboy at the age of eight, working his way through the club's youth system. After a few more years he eventually made his Cardiff City debut in the last home game of the [[2006–07 Football League Championship|2006–07 Championship season]], coming on to replace [[Paul Parry]] in the final minute of the 1–0 defeat to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 28 April 2007.

Cardiff also turned down a £1&amp;nbsp;million offer, although the deal was to start with a payment of £200,000 and rise depending on his future achievements, from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Ramsey made his first league appearance of the [[2007–08 Cardiff City F.C. season|2007–08 season]] on 6 October, when he came on as a late substitute for [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] in the 2–1 home win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

He made a total of 22 appearances during the season, his first full season of professional football, and played in five of the club's six [[2007–08 FA Cup|FA Cup]] matches, including [[2008 FA Cup Final|the final]], becoming the second youngest player to play in an [[FA Cup Final]] after [[Curtis Weston]], who played in the [[2004 FA Cup Final]] for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3725063.stm "Man Utd win FA cup"] BBC Sport.

However, he had a solid game during a convincing 3–0 Premier League win against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 24 September 2011.

Ramsey started the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 season]] well, scoring in the first leg of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] play-off against Fenerbahçe and claiming the man of the match award. In the return leg, he scored twice to end the tie 5–0 on aggregate and secure Arsenal's place in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]]. Ramsey continued his fine form in Arsenal's 3–1 win over Fulham in the second round of the [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League]], helping [[Olivier Giroud]] score the first goal via a deflection, and being named man of the match. The absence of [[Mikel Arteta]] from Arsenal's midfield saw Arsène Wenger field Ramsey in a deeper midfield role as opposed to 2011–12, and Ramsey thrived in the new role, with another inspired midfield performance against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[North London derby]] on 1 September, where he was involved in the build-up play to Giroud's goal. He then scored twice against Sunderland on 14 September, with his first goal being a first-touch volley, and the second involving build-up play with Giroud and new signing [[Mesut Özil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunderland 1-3 Arsenal: Match report |url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1314/post/first-team/sunderland-1-3-arsenal-match-report |website=Arsenal.com |accessdate=14 February 2019 |date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey continued his excellent form by scoring in Arsenal's 2–1 win over Marseille in the Champions League at the [[Stade Vélodrome]] and scoring the opener in a 3–1 Premier League win against Stoke City four days later. On 28 September, he was again named as the man of the match as he netted another goal and claimed an assist in the away game against Swansea City, which Arsenal won 2–1. Three days later, in a game against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in a Champions League fixture, he set up Özil's first goal for Arsenal.

Manager [[Gary Speed]] appointed Ramsey as permanent captain of Wales, beginning with the match against England on 26 March 2011.

Ramsey was one of five Welshmen selected to compete at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Football Tournament]] for [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]].

During the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season, Aaron Ramsey developed into one of Arsenal's most influential players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3882551.ece |title=Dynamic Aaron Ramsey turns on the style to silence critics |date=30 September 2013 |newspaper=The Times |last=Arindam |first=Rej}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal's manager [[Arsène Wenger]] has described Ramsey as a "complete midfielder", and stated: "I was a midfielder, and I would have loved to have had what he has.

In November 2013, Ramsey was ranked alongside [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]'s [[Yaya Touré]] as the best central midfielder in the [[2013–14 Premier League]] season.
