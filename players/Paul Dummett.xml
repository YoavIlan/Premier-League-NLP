The following season he was loaned to [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20120831/dummett-is-buddies-bound_2281670_2905979 |title=Dummett Is Buddies-Bound |work=www.nufc.co.uk |publisher=Newcastle United FC |first=Dan |last=King |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "st mirren"/&gt; Dummett made his debut in a 2–0 win over [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] on 15 September 2012, and scored his first senior goal in a 1–1 draw against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St Mirren 1 St Johnstone 1: Buddies salvage point against nine-man Saints |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/st-mirren-1-st-johnstone-1480664|publisher=Daily Record|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from his loan spell at St Mirren,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Dummett to return to Newcastle following St Mirren loan|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/st-mirren/208446-paul-dummett-to-return-to-newcastle-following-st-mirren-loan/|publisher=STV|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dummett made his debut senior appearance for Newcastle in an [[2012–13 FA Cup|FA Cup]] tie away defeat to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 5 January 2013.

====Return to Newcastle United====
[[File:Paul Dummett 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Dummett playing for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2016]]

Dummett returned to Newcastle, and signed a one-year contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conor Newton and Paul Dummett have agreed new deals at Newcastle|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/8792260/Conor-Newton-and-Paul-Dummett-have-agreed-new-deals-at-Newcastle|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club as a substitute during a 4–0 defeat to [[Manchester City]] on the opening fixture of the 2013–14 season, coming on after a sending off of fellow defender [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]] and playing the full second half of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City 4–0 Newcastle United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23662898|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Newcastle in a 2–2 draw at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Goal For Dummett As 10-Man Newcastle Make Point|url=http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/86080/newcastle-united-2-2-liverpool-first-goal-for-dummett-as-10|publisher=Sky Tyne &amp; Wear|date=19 October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210607/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/newcastleunited/article/86080/newcastle-united-2-2-liverpool-first-goal-for-dummett-as-10|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after scoring his goal for the club, Dummett put pen-to-paper on a new contract at Newcastle, signing a deal that could extend until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24504079|title=Newcastle United 2–2 Liverpool|first=|last=Mandeep Sanghera BBC Sport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the final day of the season, Dummett made a challenge on Liverpool forward [[Luis Suárez]]. Due to knee surgery which jeopardised Suárez's chances of playing at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], fans in his native Uruguay sent online death threats to Dummett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luis Suarez injury: Uruguay fans blame Newcastle's Paul Dummett|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27534751|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dummett started the [[2014–15 Newcastle United F.C. season|2014–15 season]] as Newcastle's first-choice left back, with [[Davide Santon]] injured and [[Massadio Haïdara]] on the bench. Dummett grabbed his second Magpies goal on 25 September 2014, scoring a late winner in extra-time against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace 2–3 Newcastle United (aet)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29233096|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing alongside captain [[Fabricio Coloccini]] in the centre of defence, Dummett helped Newcastle keep clean sheets in victories over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester City vs. Newcastle United – 29 October 2014|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/10/29/england/league-cup/manchester-city-football-club/newcastle-united-football-club/1950095/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Bromwich Albion vs. Newcastle United – 9 November 2014|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/09/england/premier-league/west-bromwich-albion-football-club/newcastle-united-football-club/1703711/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 January 2016, Dummett scored a 90th minute equaliser against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a match that ended in a 3–3 draw at [[St James' Park]].

==International career==
Dummett qualifies to play for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] through his Welsh grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dummett profile|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Teams/PlayerProfile/0,,10278~58196,00.html|publisher=nufc.co.uk|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was capped at [[Wales national under-21 football team|under-21]] level for Wales.&lt;ref name="st mirren"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintmirren.net/pages/?p=15248 |title=Defender in on Loan |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |work=www.saintmirren.net |publisher=St Mirren FC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063134/http://www.saintmirren.net/pages/?p=15248 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut for Wales in the match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 4 June 2014, coming in as a substitute in the 83rd minute. Dummett played his second international match on 13 November 2015, again against the Netherlands, coming on for [[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]] in 65th minute. In May 2016, Dummett was listed for the 29-man squad for a pre-[[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] training camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gareth Bale left out of Wales' Euro 2016 training squad because of Champions League commitments|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-bale-left-out-wales-11307513|publisher=Wales Online|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dummett was among six players to be cut for the Euro 2016 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Euro 2016: Huddersfield Town transfer target makes Wales squad but Emyr Huws cut|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/sport/football/news/euro-2016-huddersfield-town-transfer-11408209|publisher=The Huddersfield Examiner|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Wales manager [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] said that Dummett would no longer make himself available for international selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40049274 |title=Paul Dummett: Newcastle United defender quits Wales duty |first=Owain |last=Llyr |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled to the national team in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45342667|title=Hal Robson-Kanu: Wales forward retires from international football|date=29 August 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|via=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
