'''Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly''' ({{lang-ar|محمد صلاح غالي}}&amp;nbsp;, {{IPA-arz|mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli}}; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egypt national team]]. He is considered Europe's top five leagues' fifth most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the [[International Centre for Sports Studies|CIES]].{{efn|As of 7 January 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2018/245/en/ |title=Brand new list of top transfer values for big-5 league players |publisher=International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) |first1=Raffaele |last1=Poli |first2=Roger |last2=Besson |first3=Loïc |last3=Ravenel |date=7 January 2019 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Salah started his senior career with Cairo club [[El Mokawloon SC|El Mokawloon]] in the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in 2010, departing shortly thereafter to join [[FC Basel|Basel]] for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, he starred as he won the league title in his debut season, winning the [[Swiss Super League|SAFP Golden Player Award]] in the process. Salah's performances then attracted [[Premier League]] side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and he joined the club for a £11&amp;nbsp;million fee in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to [[Serie A]] clubs [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15&amp;nbsp;million.

Following consistent match-winning performances in Rome to lead them to [[2016–17 A.S. Roma season|second-placed finish and a record points-tally]] in 2017, Salah relocated back to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9&amp;nbsp;million. During his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a complete [[Forward (association football)|forward]] and quickly became the focal point of the team. He would go on to break the club's scoring record for a debut season, receiving the [[Premier League Golden Boot]] after registering a record 32 goals in 36 league games. He also became the first player to win three [[Premier League Player of the Month]] awards in the same season. His record-breaking performances saw him receive a number of other accolades at the end of the season, including the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]], the [[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers' Player of the Year]] and the [[PFA Fans' Player of the Year]] awards. Salah also came third in the award for [[The Best FIFA Men's Player#Winners|the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player]].

At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level, winning a bronze medal in the [[Africa U-20 Cup of Nations]], and participated in the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. He was awarded the [[CAF Awards|CAF Most Promising African Talent]] of the Year in 2012.&lt;ref name="cafonline 21-12-2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/16154-toure-wins-his-second-african-player-of-the-year-award.html |title=Toure wins his second African Player of the Year Award |website=Confederation of African Football online.com |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=29 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194936/http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/16154-toure-wins-his-second-african-player-of-the-year-award.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making his debut with the senior national team in 2011, he helped Egypt reach the final of the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]], and he became the top scorer during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|CAF qualification]] to help the team qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. For his performances, Salah was named [[CAF African Footballer of the Year]] twice and the [[BBC African Footballer of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/liverpool-mohamed-salah-african-footballer-year |title=Liverpool's Mohamed Salah wins African footballer of the year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2018 |accessdate=4 January 2018 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/41802268 |title=Salah named African Footballer of the Year 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2017 |author=Paul Fletcher |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also selected in the [[CAF Team of the Year]] and [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations#Awards|Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/african-football/caf-announces-2017-african-team-of-the-year/286372 |title=CAF Announces 2017 African Team of the Year |website=soccerladuma.co.za |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/galleries/nations-cup-2017-team-of-the-tournament/1/1izlgkcrkx7gk1vkucyhqs6822 |title=Nations Cup 2017: Team of the Tournament |website=Goal.com |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===El Mokawloon===
Salah played his youth football with [[El Mokawloon SC|El Mokawloon]]. He made his senior team debut in the [[Egyptian Premier League]] coming on as a substitute on 3 May 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against [[El Mansoura SC|El Mansoura]]. During the [[2010–11 Egyptian Premier League|2010–11 season]] Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/mohamed-salah-how-a-boy-from-egypt-is-now-the-king-of-liverpool |title=Mohamed Salah: How a boy from Egypt is now the King of Liverpool |date=23 April 2018 |author=Saketh Ayyagari |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/413347/Live/Egypt-Premier-League-2010-2011-Al-Ahly-Al-Mokawloon-Al-Arab |title=Al Ahly 1–1 Al Mokawloon Al Arab – Premier League 2010/2011 Live |website=WhoScored.com |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a regular for El Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the [[2011-12 Egyptian Premier League|2011–12 season]]. Following the [[Port Said Stadium riot]] on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March 2012, the [[Egyptian Football Association]] announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17324997 |title=Egypt's Premier League cancelled |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basel===
[[Swiss Super League]] club [[FC Basel|Basel]] had been monitoring Salah for some time, so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt U-23 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2015/08/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-mohamed-salah |title=11 Things You Need to Know About Mohamed Salah |publisher=A.S. Roma |date=6 August 2015 |author=Paul Rogers |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match took place on 16 March at the [[Stadion Rankhof]] in [[Basel]], and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.&lt;ref name="Caspar Marti"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2012/03/16/Munteres-Testspiel-gegen-Agyptens-Olympia-Auswahl |title=Cheerful test match against Egypt's Olympics selection ends 3:4 (Translation) |language=de |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |date=16 March 2012 |author=Caspar Marti |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.&lt;ref name="Georges Küng"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/basel-stadt/fc-basel-verpflichtet-den-aegyptischen-jungstar-mohamed-salah-124081175 |title=FC Basel commit to young Egyptian star Mohamed Salah (Translation) |language=de |newspaper=Basellandschaftliche Zeitung |date=10 April 2012 |author=Georges Küng |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/53/38929/Sports/Talents-Abroad/Egypt-rising-star-Salah-officially-joins-FC-Basel.aspx |title=Egypt rising star Salah officially joins FC Basel |newspaper=Al-Ahram |year=2012 |author=Ahmed Abd El Rasoul |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kingfut.com/2018/02/13/former-basel-president-salah/ |title=Former Basel President recalls watching Salah live for first time |publisher=KingFut |date=13 February 2018 |author=Abdelrahman Amr |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14: Final season and league championship====
To the start of the [[2013–14 Swiss Super League]] season Salah was member of the Basel team that won the 2013 [[Uhrencup]].&lt;ref name="fcb 2013-07-082"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2013/07/08/Der-FCB-gewinnt-den-Uhrencup-2013-mit-einem-Sieg-g |title=FCB wins the 2013 Uhrencup with a victory against Red Star Belgrade (Translation) |language=de |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |date=8 July 2013 |author=Caspar Marti |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah scored on his first league appearance against [[FC Aarau|Aarau]] on 13 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/basel-v-aarau/3gu4g4t82whn2qb1sc43p3ogk |title=Basel v Aarau Match preview |website=Goal.com |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] goal a month later against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] on 6 August 2013 in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|third qualifying round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000477/match=2011724/index.html |title=Maccabi revival comes too late to halt Basel |publisher=UEFA |date=6 August 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the first leg on 30 July 2013, Salah did not take part in the [[UEFA]]-mandated pre-match handshakes with Maccabi players. Basel called the incident a "coincidence" and said it was not intended as a snub. Salah was on pressure from several Egyptian voices demanding from him not to travel to Israel and then criticizing his visit.

[[File:Mohamed Salah with Chelsea - Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Salah playing for Chelsea away at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] on 1 January 2015]]

Before the [[2014–15 Chelsea F.C. season|2014–15 season]], Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in a balance after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2014/07/19/chelsea-midfielder-mohamed-salah-could-be-forced-into-military-service-by-egyptian-government-4803656/ |title=Chelsea midfielder Mohamed Salah 'could be forced into military service by Egyptian government' |newspaper=Metro |date=19 July 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was spared of military service after the meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education and the Egyptian national manager [[Shawky Gharib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/mohamed-salah-will-not-have-to-serve-military-service-after-the-egyptian-prime-minister-steps-in-to-solve-chelsea-midfielders-travel-issue--reports-9618033.html |title=Mohamed Salah: Chelsea midfielder will NOT have to serve military service after Egyptian Prime Minister steps |newspaper=The Independent |date=21 July 2014 |author=Jack de Menezes |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by [[Eden Hazard]] changing to number 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2014/08/15/squad-number-changes |title=Squad Number Changes |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salah was rarely used during the season. On 28 October 2014, in a 2–1 win at [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the fourth round of the League Cup, he took a shot that went so far off target that it went for a throw-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/making-mohamed-salah-no-stage-did-i-believe-i-didnt-belong-level-absolutely-not |title=The making of Mohamed Salah: "At no stage did I believe I didn’t belong at this level.

===Controversy===
At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], in which Egypt were based in [[Chechnya]], Salah agreed to posing with [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], after the Chechen leader made a surprise visit to the team's hotel and requested a photo shoot with him at the stadium during their team training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831753/Mohamed-Salah-unknowingly-centre-controversy-Chechen-leader-Ramzan-Kadyrov.html |title=Egypt's Mohamed Salah finds himself at the centre of controversy after Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov requests public photo with the superstar |date=11 June 2018 |newspaper=Daily Mail}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov later gave him honorary citizenship of the Chechen Republic in a public dinner made for the whole Egypt national team and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/23/mohamed-salah-given-honorary-citizenship-chechnya-strongman/ |title=Mohamed Salah given honorary citizenship of Chechnya by strongman ruler accused of human rights abuses |author=Alec Luhn |date=23 June 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several western news outlets and NGOs criticised Salah and the [[Egyptian Football Association|EFA]] for their interactions with Kadyrov, citing the president's alleged human rights abuses and that the player is used for 'political propaganda' by the dictator during Egypt's national team training camp in Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12098/11404005/mohamed-salah-used-for-political-propaganda-by-ramzan-kadyrov-say-gay-rights-and-equality-campaigners |title=Mohamed Salah used for 'political propaganda' by Ramzan Kadyrov, say gay rights and equality campaigners |date=13 June 2018 |accessdate=24 June 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/35849/11414957/mohamed-salah-honoured-by-chechnya-leader-ramzan-kadyrov |title=Mohamed Salah honoured by Chechnya leader Ramzan Kadyrov |date=24 June 2018 |accessdate=24 June 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Liverpool referred Salah to Merseyside police after footage was posted online which showed him allegedly using a phone while driving in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-45175226 |title=Video apparently shows Mo Salah using a phone while driving |date=13 August 2018 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11472119/liverpool-refer-mohamed-salah-to-police-after-allegedly-using-phone-while-driving |title=Liverpool refer Mohamed Salah to police after allegedly using phone while driving |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/mo-salah-referred-to-police-after-being-filmed-using-mobile-phone-while-driving-a3910621.html |title=Police probe as Mo Salah 'is filmed using mobile phone while driving' |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=13 August 2018 |author=Sean Morrison |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah's indiscretion was brought to light after autograph hunter Rob Wylie posted a video online apparently showing the Egyptian ignoring requests for autographs. Wylie, whose conduct had previously resulted in Liverpool instituting a policy which banned players giving autographs from their vehicles, received widespread criticism from the club's supporters and had to temporarily shut down his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mo-salah-mobile-phone-autograph-15029494 |title=Mo Salah mobile phone autograph hunter speaks out after online accusations |author=Jonathan Humphries |date=14 August 2018 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=27 August 2018 |publisher=Reach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.iol.co.za/sport/soccer/premier-league/man-who-took-mohamed-salah-phone-video-denies-sending-it-to-police-16567536 |title=Man who took Mohamed Salah ‘phone video’ denies sending it to police |author=Ashfak Mohamed |date=14 August 2018 |website=Independent Online |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salah's relationship with the [[Egyptian Football Association]] (EFA) was reported to have soured during the World Cup, after his image was used without his permission to promote the national team's sponsor, [[Telecom Egypt|WE]], the mobile service of [[Telecom Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45322205 |title=Mohamed Salah accuses Egyptian FA of ignoring complaints over image rights |author=Tarek Talaat |date=27 August 2018 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the incident, Salah was sponsored by WE's telecommunications rivals, [[Vodafone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-forward-mohamed-salah-embroiled-15077448 |title=Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah embroiled in fresh row with Egyptian FA over image rights |author=Ian Doyle |date=27 August 2018 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=27 August 2018 |publisher=Reach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool fans created a chant to the tune of [[Dodgy]]'s "[[Good Enough (Dodgy song)|Good Enough]]", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – "If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-43081318/mohamed-salah-inspires-i-ll-be-muslim-too-chant |title=Mohamed Salah inspires "I'll be Muslim too" chant |publisher=BBC News |date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah gave his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43208945 |title=Mohamed Salah: Is Liverpool striker's success improving engagement with Muslim fans? |last1=Din |first1=Tusdiq |date=1 March 2018 |accessdate=14 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.&lt;ref name=AlSayyad/&gt; During his [[goal celebration]], Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank god in [[sujud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/champions-league-final-liverpool-star-mohamed-salah-s-unapologetic-muslim-ncna877736 |title=Champions League final: Liverpool star Mohamed Salah's unapologetic Muslim faith sends extraordinary message |publisher=NBC News |date=26 May 2018 |author=Jalal Baig |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in ''[[FIFA 19]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://talksport.com/football/418292/fifa-19-new-celebrations-cristiano-ronaldo-paul-pogba-neymar |title=UPDATED FIFA 19 new celebrations and tutorial, ft Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba and Neymar |publisher=talkSPORT |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his goal that led Egypt to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup finals]] for the first time since [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], a school in Egypt was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/egyptian-school-named-after-liverpool-star-salah-follow-world-cup-heroics-4202820 |title=Egyptian school named after Liverpool star Salah following World Cup heroics |publisher=Tribal Football.com |date=29 June 2018 |author=Eshlin Vedan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police did arrive to cordon off his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-comes-out-to-meet-fans-outside-of-home-after-address/1bmka2qglx9vk1ebkp65qrm7of |title=Mohamed Salah news: Liverpool star comes out to meet Egypt fans after huge crowd appears outside of home |website=Goal.com |date=29 June 2018 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
