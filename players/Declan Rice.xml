===West Ham United===
On 16 December 2015, just over a year after joining West Ham United at youth level, Rice signed his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/december/28-december/declan-rice-career-timeline |title=Declan Rice: A career timeline |date=28 December 2018 |accessdate=28 December 2018 |publisher=West Ham United F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice was called into the West Ham senior squad for the first time for the games against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in April 2017, after impressing in the [[West Ham United F.C. Under-23s and Academy|under-23 team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/players/exclusive-declan-rice-says-stay-13007172 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Declan Rice says he will stay level headed despite West Ham call-up |first=Sam |last=Inkersole |website=football.london |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on the last day of the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season, coming on as a 91st-minute substitute for [[Edimilson Fernandes]] in a 2–1 away win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39912028 |title=Burnley 1–2 West Ham United |date=21 May 2017 |accessdate=21 May 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2017/may/22-may/rice-its-dream-come-true |title=Rice&amp;nbsp;– It's a dream come true |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; five days after captaining the under-23's to promotion with a 2–1 win at [[Newcastle United F.C.

In April 2018, Rice was named as runner-up for the 2017–18 [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]] award behind [[Marko Arnautović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/april/25-april/arnautovic-crowned-betway-hammer-year |title=Arnautovic crowned Betway Hammer of the Year |publisher=West Ham United F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December, he made his 50th appearance for West Ham, the first player to do so while still a teenager since [[Michael Carrick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mason's ironic cheers &amp; Rice going mad – West Ham moments missed |last=Inkersole |first=Sam |website=football.london |date=15 November 2018 |accessdate=30 December 2018 |url=https://www.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/fixtures-results/masons-ironic-cheers-holebass-clearance-15588611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Analysis: Resilient Rice has shown age is no barrier |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |date=29 December 2018 |accessdate=30 December 2018 |url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/december/29-december/analysis-resilient-rice-has-shown-age-no-barrier}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December, Rice signed a new contract until 2024 with the option of an additional year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/december/28-december/west-ham-united-sign-declan-rice-new-long-term-contract |title=West Ham United sign Declan Rice to new long-term contract |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |accessdate=29 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice scored his first goal for West Ham, and was named [[man of the match]], in a 1–0 win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 12 January 2019 in West Ham's 50th Premier League game at the [[London Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46766896 |title=West Ham United 1–0 Arsenal |first=Neil |last=Johnston |date=12 January 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Although born in London, Rice is eligible to play for Ireland as his grandparents were from [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/rice-grateful-to-talent-scout-otoole-for-helping-his-swift-rise-36198526.html |title=Rice grateful to talent scout O'Toole for helping his swift rise |first=John |last=Fallon |newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin |date=5 October 2017 |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March 2017, Rice was named [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|Republic of Ireland U17]] player of the year.&lt;ref name="3fai2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/winners-revealed-for-three-fai-international-football-awards |title=Winners revealed for Three FAI International Football Awards |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 2017, only days after his [[Premier League]] debut, Rice was named in the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] squad to play friendlies against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and a World Cup qualifier at home to [[Austria national football team|Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/west-ham-teenager-declan-rice-called-into-ireland-senior-squad-by-martin-oneill-along-with-cork-duo-35747101.html |title=West Ham teenager Declan Rice called into Ireland senior squad by Martin O'Neill along with Cork duo |first=Aidan |last=Fitzmaurice |newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut on 23 March 2018 in a 1–0 defeat to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the42.ie/ireland-turkey-report-3921212-Mar2018/ |title=New faces fail to inspire Ireland in Turkey |date=23 March 2018 |website=The42.ie |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Rice was omitted from the squad to play [[Wales national football team|Wales]] by manager [[Martin O'Neill]] who said that Rice was considering switching to play for [[England national football team|England]] after being approached by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/27/england-have-spoken-to-declan-rice-martin-oneill-west-ham |title=England 'have spoken to' West Ham's Declan Rice, says Martin O'Neill |agency=Press Association |date=27 August 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2018, having been omitted from three squads selected by O'Neill, Rice said he was no closer in deciding whether to play for Ireland or England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46153251 |title=Declan Rice: Choosing between England and Republic of Ireland not easy |date=9 November 2018 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, Rice met with new Ireland manager [[Mick McCarthy]] and his assistant, [[Robbie Keane]]. McCarthy said that Rice was a potential future captain of Ireland and that he would build the team around Rice should he decide to play for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46666804 |title=Declan Rice: Republic of Ireland boss Mick McCarthy says West Ham player could be his captain |date=23 December 2018 |accessdate=28 December 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2019, Rice pledged his future to England.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/declan-rice-england-republic-of-ireland-country-nationality-west-ham-united-gareth-southgate-a8777776.html |title=Declan Rice pledges future to England |date=13 February 2019 |accessdate= 13 February 2019 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47286157|title=Declan Rice: Is West Ham midfielder ready for England?|date=18 February 2019|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
