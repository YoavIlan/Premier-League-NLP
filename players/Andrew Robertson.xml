'''Andrew Robertson''' (born 11 March 1994) is a Scottish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and captains the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]].

Robertson began his senior career with [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] in 2012 before joining [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] a year later. His form in his first season as a professional led to him being named [[SPFA Young Player of the Year]] and also making his international debut. He joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in July 2014 for a fee of £2.85&amp;nbsp;million, before joining Liverpool in July 2017 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be an initial £8&amp;nbsp;million. 

Robertson made his full international debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in May 2014, and he was appointed [[list of Scotland national football team captains|Scotland captain]] in September 2018.

==Early life and career==
Robertson was born in [[Glasgow]]. He attended [[St Ninian's High School, Giffnock|St Ninian's High School]] in [[Giffnock]], East Renfrewshire, from 2006 to 2012, where he captained the football team. He also played for Giffnock Soccer Centre and joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a youth, but was released at under-15 level because he was considered to be too small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dundee-united-starlet-andy-roberston-2900858|title=Dundee United starlet Andy Roberston: Celtic made a small blunder the day they let me go|work=Daily Record|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then signed for [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].

==Club career==

===Queen's Park===
Focusing on his studies, Robertson was on the brink of starting university at undergraduate degree level before he was called up to the Queen's Park first team at the beginning of the [[2012–13 in Scottish football|2012–13 season]]. He made his debut for the club in the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]], in a penalty shoot out win against [[Berwick Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19027896 |title=Ramsdens Cup: Berwick Rangers 2–2 Queen's Park (aet, 2–3 pens) |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make a total of forty appearances during the season,&lt;ref name="Andrew Robertson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=124&amp;ID=415|title=Andrew Robertson|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=5 August 2013}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping the club to a third-place finish in the [[2012-13 Scottish Third Division|Scottish Third Division]]. His first goal for the club came in a 2–1 defeat to [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] on 13 November 2012.&lt;ref name="Andrew Robertson"/&gt;

===Dundee United===
Robertson signed for [[Scottish Premiership]] side [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], along with Queen's Park teammate [[Aidan Connolly]], on 3 June 2013;&lt;ref name="Dundee United sign Robertson and Connolly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22762888|title=Dundee Utd sign Queen's Park's Robertson and Connolly|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=3 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; he took the squad place of the departing [[Barry Douglas]] who had made the same move three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/news/2895/BARRY-DOUGLAS-JOINS-UNITED.html|author=|title= Barry Douglas joins United|work=|date=21 June 2010|publisher= [[Dundee United F.C.]] |accessdate=9 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having being ignored in their requests for a transfer fee for Douglas, Queen's Park (an amateur club) protested at the prospect of more players departing to United for nothing and eventually agreed a deal involving a percentage of future transfers, which would later prove beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13172018.300k-robertson-boost-a-cut-above-for-queens-park/|author=|title= £300k Robertson boost a cut above for Queen's Park|work=The Herald |date=27 July 2014|publisher= |accessdate=9 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson immediately became part of manager [[Jackie McNamara]]'s first team plans, making his debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 0–0 draw with [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. On 22 September 2013, Robertson scored his first goal for Dundee United, in a 2–2 draw against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee United 2–2 Motherwell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24098544|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran from his own half before sending a low left-foot drive in to the goal from 22 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/dundee-utd-2-2-motherwell-ainsworth-stuns-utd-1-3106278 |title=Dundee Utd 2–2 Motherwell: Ainsworth stuns Utd |newspaper= The Scotsman|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he agreed a new contract with United, until May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee secure Robertson extension|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=2&amp;nid=4617&amp;cd=2013|publisher= Dundee United F.C. |date=4 October 2013|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted [[Scottish Professional Football League monthly awards|SPFL young player of the month]] for September 2013 and player of the month for November 2013.&lt;ref name="pom1113"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee United defender wins player award|url=http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/sport/dundee-united/dundee-united-defender-wins-player-award-1.162529|work=Evening Telegraph|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2014, Robertson played in the [[2013–14 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] Semi-final against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], which United won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangers 1–3 Dundee United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26898652|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Wilson|first=Richard|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Robertson won the [[PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year]] award&lt;ref name="ypoy14"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Celtic players make player of year shortlist|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27052382|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Robertson: Dundee United defender wins PFA prize|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27183894|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also named in the [[PFA Scotland Team of the Year]] for the [[2013–14 Scottish Premiership]].&lt;ref name="toy14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27080030|title=Celtic and Dundee United trios in SPFL Premiership team of year|date=18 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was first selected by the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21 team]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24352061|title=Billy Stark names Scotland Under-21 squad for Euro 2015 ties|date=1 October 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut as a substitute in a 2–1 win against [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2015/teams/player=250066157/index.html|title=Under-21 – Andrew Robertson – UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
