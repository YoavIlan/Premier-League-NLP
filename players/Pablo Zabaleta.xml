'''Pablo Javier Zabaleta Girod'''  ({{IPA-es|ˈpaβlo saβaˈleta|am}}; born 16 January 1985&lt;ref name=MCFC2014/&gt;) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]] for English {{English football updater|WestHamU}} club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

With [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Zabaleta won all of English football's major honours: the [[FA Cup]] ([[2010–11 FA Cup|2011]]), the Premier League ([[2011–12 Premier League|2012]] and 2014), and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] ([[2013–14 Football League Cup|2014]] and 2016). Before joining Manchester City, Zabaleta played for [[La Liga]] club [[RCD Espanyol]], where he won the [[2005–06 Copa del Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/players/pablo-zabaleta/|title=Pablo Zabaleta|accessdate=22 April 2014|publisher=Eurosport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 333 appearances over nine seasons for Manchester City before signing for London-based club West Ham United in the summer of 2017.

A full international since 2005, Zabaleta represented Argentina at the [[2011 Copa América|2011]] and [[2015 Copa América]], and was part of their team which finished as runners-up in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He was also in their team which won gold at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]].

==Club career==
===San Lorenzo===
Born in [[Buenos Aires]], Zabaleta was raised in [[Arrecifes]]. He began his career at [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro]] in 2002 after progressing through their youth ranks, having been signed at the age of 12 from local club ''Obras Sanitarias''. He started playing as a [[defensive midfielder]] but eventually moved to the right side of midfield.

===Espanyol===
Zabaleta was transferred to [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] in 2005 for €3 million after being [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20]]s [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], which Argentina won. During the [[2005–06 La Liga|2005–06 season]], Zabaleta helped Espanyol to win the [[2005–06 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], playing the full 90 minutes in the 4–1 defeat of [[Real Zaragoza]] in [[2006 Copa del Rey Final|the final]].&lt;ref name="paradise"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zabaleta rejects Juventus in favour of move to 'paradise' |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/29/manchestercity.espanyolzabaleta |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 August 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Zabaleta suffered a [[shoulder]] injury that kept him off the pitch for almost three months, already having established himself as an undisputed first team choice. Later in the season, he featured in the [[2006–07 UEFA Cup]] [[2007 UEFA Cup Final|final]], where Espanyol lost on penalties to fellow Spanish side [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].

===Manchester City===
====2008–2012====

In the summer of 2008, Zabaleta transferred to [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] after rejecting an offer from [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He stated upon joining that "the offer of Manchester City is impossible to reject."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Espanyol's Zabaleta turns down Juventus to join Man City for £6.5m |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1050567/Espanyols-Zabaleta-turns-Juventus-join-Man-City-6-5m.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=29 August 2008 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ladyman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having passed a medical and agreed personal terms, Zabaleta completed a five-year deal with City on 31 August 2008 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be the buy-out clause Zabaleta had attached to his contract of around £6.45 million.&lt;ref name=paradise/&gt; Zabaleta joined a day before Manchester City was bought by the [[Abu Dhabi United Group]], led by [[Sheikh Mansour]], which enabled a wealth of investment in the club.

On 13 September 2008, Zabaleta made his debut for Manchester City in a 3–1 defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]]. On 5 October, he received his first [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] in English football when he was sent off in a 3–2 loss to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in his fourth Premier League appearance. He scored his first goal for City on 17 January 2009, the only goal of the game in a 1–0 league win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7815631.stm|title=Man City 1–0 Wigan|publisher=BBC|date=17 January 2009|accessdate=2 January 2010|first=Chris|last=Bevan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2010, Zabaleta scored his second Premier League goal in Manchester City's 4–1 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. In the same match, he [[Assist (football)|assisted]] a [[Carlos Tevez]] goal, helping his compatriot to earn his ninth goal for the club during the [[2010–11 Manchester City F.C. season|2010–11]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fulham 1–4 Manchester City |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/293144?cc=5901 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2011, Zabaleta played his 100th game for Manchester City in all competitions, coming off the bench against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in a 1–0 win at Eastlands. Two weeks later, on 15 January, Zabaleta made his second assist of the season in a 4–3 win over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester 4–3 Wolves |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/match?id=293123&amp;cc=5901 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This win meant that City went top of [[2010–11 Premier League|the league]] above [[Manchester derby|local rivals]] [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. However, City's title challenge faded with a loss of form in February and March 2011.

On 1 May 2011, Zabaleta scored his second goal of the season in a Premier League match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. This secured a 2–1 win for the Citizens and put them seven points ahead of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the race for [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|fourth place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester City 2–1 West Ham |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/293139?cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2011, Zabaleta appeared as an 88th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for Carlos Tevez in the [[2011 FA Cup Final]] as Manchester City beat [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 1–0.&lt;ref name=11cup&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibbs|first=Thom|title=FA Cup final 2011: Manchester City v Stoke City live|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/8513729/FA-Cup-final-2011-Manchester-City-v-Stoke-City-live.html|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011, it was reported that Italian club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] were keen on signing Zabaleta, but Manchester City insisted the player was not for sale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Roma to launch £6m Zabaleta bid, but Manchester City unwilling to sell Argentina defender |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2014502/Roma-launch-6m-bid-Pablo-Zabaleta-Manchester-City-unwilling-sell-Argentina-defender.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=14 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zabaleta agreed a three-year contract in July 2011. On 1 October 2011, Zabaleta started and played the full 90 minutes at right-back in a 4–0 win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] in the Premier League, as regular starter [[Micah Richards]] was not available. On 23 October, he was an unused substitute in the convincing 1–6 win over rivals Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]], with Richards starting at right-back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zabaleta agrees three-year deal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/zabaleta-agrees-threeyear-deal-2318961.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=23 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Zabaleta extended his contract with City until the summer of 2015. Zabaleta said, "I'm in a very good team, and I try to do my best for the club, the team and the fans. I didn't think twice, I gave a quick answer because I was so happy to sign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2063216/Manchester-City-new-deals-Adam-Johnson-Pablo-Zabaleta.html | location=London | newspaper=Daily Mail | title=Going places!

On 30 April 2012, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the right-back slot in a 1–0 victory over rivals Manchester United thanks to a first-half stoppage time header by [[Vincent Kompany]] from a corner at the City of Manchester Stadium. Zabaleta scored the first goal in City's dramatic 3–2 win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on the final day of the [[2011–12 Premier League|season]], a result which secured the first league title for the club since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man City 3 QPR 2|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4313835/Man-City-3-2-QPR-Match-report-pictures-video-highlights.html|newspaper=The Sun|location=London|first=Shaun|last=Custis}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2012, Zabaleta scored a late equalising goal in a 3–2 defeat to Manchester United.

Zabaleta was sent off in the [[2013 FA Cup Final]] against Wigan Athletic for a second [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] after a clear foul on [[Callum McManaman]] 84 minutes into the match.
