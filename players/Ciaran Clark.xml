'''Ciaran Clark''' (born 26 September 1989) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]]. Clark is naturally a [[Defender (association football)|central defender]], but is also able to operate as a [[Midfielder|central midfielder]] and at [[Leftback|left-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark is Villa's 'Mr Versatile' |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/aston-villa-fc/2011/01/04/ciaran-clark-is-villas-mr-versatile/ |work=[[Express &amp; Star]] |date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark captained [[England national football team|England]] at under-18, under-19 and under-20 level, but in October 2010 declared his ambition to play for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], the country of his parents' birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark confirms allegiance to Ireland |url=http://greenscene.me/2010/10/ciaran-clark-confirms-allegiance-to-ireland/ |publisher=GreenScene |date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called up to the national team a month later for the friendly match against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and made his full debut against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 8 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_commentary/0,19764,11065_3344087,00.html?reloaded |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910104855/http://www.skysports.com/football/match_commentary/0,19764,11065_3344087,00.html?reloaded |dead-url=yes |archivedate=10 September 2012 |work=Sky Sports |title=FT: Republic of Ireland 3 Wales 0 |date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
====Early career====
Clark was born in [[Harrow, London]],&lt;ref name=Hugman1011/&gt; and grew up in [[Sandy, Bedfordshire]]. He came through the [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|Aston Villa youth academy]] after joining at the age of eleven, and captained the academy U18 team to the [[2007–08 Premier Academy League]]—the academy's maiden league title. He was given a squad number for the 2008–09 season and named on the bench for Villa's [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]] match away at [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], but remained an unused substitute. He captained the reserves to the [[Premier Reserve League|Premier Reserve League South]] title and defeated PRL North winners Sunderland in the play-off final to win their first ever Reserve League trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RESERVES: VILLA 3–1 Sunderland |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1664139,00.html |date=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181207/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10265~1664139%2C00.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–10 season====
Clark was included in the squads for the pre-season friendlies and the [[2009 Peace Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peace Cup squad |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1730353,00.html |publisher=Aston Villa F.C. |date=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181216/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1730353,00.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2009, he made his debut in a 2–0 win against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. With [[Curtis Davies]] unavailable through injury, the 19-year-old was named in Villa's starting line-up, partnering [[Carlos Cuéllar]] in defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Fulham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8222321.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped keep a clean sheet and nearly marked his debut with a goal but sent his header inches wide. [[Garth Crooks]] of the [[BBC]] named the youngster in his team of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garth Crooks' team of the week |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 August 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/score_on_bbci/7631245.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the formidable partnership of new signings [[James Collins (footballer, born 1983)|James Collins]] and [[Richard Dunne]] limited him to the bench, he was tipped to break into the first team on a regular basis within several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Future is bright for Aston Villa youngsters, says Gordon Cowans |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/future-is-bright-for-aston-villa-youngsters-64815 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, he signed a contract extension until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark grateful for deal at Aston Villa |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2009/11/28/ciaran-clarke-grateful-for-deal-at-aston-villa-97319-25272783/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926181537/http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2009/11/28/ciaran-clarke-grateful-for-deal-at-aston-villa-97319-25272783/ |archivedate=26 September 2012 |work=Birmingham Mail |date=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–11 season====
Clark started in the first two league games of the 2010–11 season: against [[West Ham United]], partnering Richard Dunne and keeping a clean sheet; then against [[Newcastle United]]. Clark was also handed a start in [[Gérard Houllier]]'s first match as new Villa manager, against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. He then started the match against local rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in midfield and continued in the role against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] due to the club's injury crisis. On 27 November 2010, Clark scored his first two goals for the club in a 4–2 defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at home. He scored a 91st-minute equaliser against Chelsea on 2 January 2011 to rescue a point. He also became the only player in Premier League history to be booked in six successive appearances within the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/298830089494343680 |title=Twitter / OptaJoe: 6 – The only player in PL history |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=25 November 2013}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011–12 season====
Clark scored his first FA Cup goal for the club against Bristol Rovers on 29 January 2012, with a solo run, including stepovers and a left-footed strike curled into the bottom corner.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====2012–13 season====
[[File:CiaranClark.JPG|thumb|upright|Clark playing for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 2013]]

On 25 August 2012, he was sent off against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a professional foul on [[Nikica Jelavić]]. On 3 September 2012, he scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. On 8 December 2012, after captaining Villa's youth and reserve sides, Clark was handed the armband for the senior side for the first time in a 0–0 draw at home to [[Stoke City F.C|Stoke]], after [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]] who had started the match as captain was replaced by [[Darren Bent]]. Three days later, Clark followed up his initial role as captain by performing the role again, this time for the full 90 minutes, in a 4–1 victory in the League Cup away at [[Norwich City F.C|Norwich]] which saw Villa qualify for the semi-finals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====2013–14 season====
Clark started Aston Villa's first game in their 3–1 away victory at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. After a dip in his form midway through Aston Villa's season, he was dropped to the bench as Lambert preferred a partnership between Ron Vlaar and fellow academy graduate, [[Nathan Baker]]. However, due to injury constantly plaguing Aston Villa's defence, along with consistently poor results, Clark still managed 28 appearances in a season that saw Villa finish 15th on 38 points. He accumulated nine yellow cards throughout the season.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In January 2014 during a training game Clark broke the right leg of his team-mate [[Libor Kozák]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2014/01/07/4527629/clark-backs-aston-villa-team-mate-kozak-to-come-back&lt;/ref&gt; The mishandled injury&lt;ref&gt;https://7500toholte.sbnation.com/2015/1/3/7486465/libor-kozak-aston-villa-injury-update-january-fitness-test&lt;/ref&gt; virtually ended Kozák's Premier League carrier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/aston-villa/362/blog/post/2749468/libor-kozak-waiting-for-second-chance-at-aston-villa&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
Aston Villa began the 2014–15 season in good form with [[Paul Lambert]] re-introducing [[Alan Hutton]], forming a new look back four of Alan Hutton, [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Philippe Senderos]] and [[Aly Cissokho]]. When an injury ruled Vlaar out, Nathan Baker came into the back four, with Clark remaining on the bench. After injuries to both Baker and Senderos, Clark was called on along with [[Jores Okore]] and formed a solid partnership. Clark scored his first goal of the season from a free-kick curled in by [[Ashley Westwood (footballer, born 1990)|Ashley Westwood]] in a 2–1 home victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aston Villa 2–1 Leicester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30266471 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newcastle United===
On 3 August 2016, Newcastle announced that they have completed the signing of Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160803/united-complete-clark-capture_2281670_5776745 |title=United Complete Clark Capture |website=Newcastle United |date=3 August 2016 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having established himself alongside club captain [[Jamaal Lascelles]] in central defence, he scored his first goal for the club in a 6–0 win against [[Queens Park Rangers]] on 13 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37282510 |title=QPR 0–6 Newcastle |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to add further goals against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] while also helping Newcastle concede the joint-lowest number of goals in the division as they returned to the [[Premier League]] at the first time of asking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/england/championship/20162017/regular-season/r36638/tables/ |title=CHAMPIONSHIP |website=Soccerway |date=18 July 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===England===
Clark [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the [[England national under-19 football team|England U19]] team through qualification for the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|2008 European Championships]], playing in five out of the six qualifiers and scoring a goal. He missed out on the tournament through an ankle injury sustained during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Captain's Pride |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/Mens-u20s/news/2009/ciaran_clark_italy_reaction_010409 |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czechs' rivals aim to be class acts |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/news/newsid=732738.html |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being promoted to the [[England national under-20 football team|England U20s]], he was appointed captain and scored in only his second match, in a friendly against Italy on March 2008.

===Republic of Ireland===
[[File:FIFA WC-qualification 2014 - Austria vs Ireland 2013-09-10 - Ciaran Clark 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Clark playing for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in 2013]]

In late September 2010, [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) officials approached Clark about switching his allegiance. They sent [[Scout (association football)|scout]] and former [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|Republic of Ireland under-21]] manager, [[Don Givens]], to watch him in the match against Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republic of Ireland approach Ciaran Clark about switching his England allegiance |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/republic-of-ireland-approach-ciaran-clark-132582 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2010, it was reported that Clark had pledged his international future to the Irish national team as he qualified through his Irish parents. [[Richard Dunne]] played a role in convincing him and had spoken to FAI scouts about his eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark pledges international future to Ireland – after ringing endorsement from Richard Dunne |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ciaran-clark-pledges-international-future-132941 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2010, Clark was named in the Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ciaran Clark called up the Irish Squad |url=http://greenscene.me/2010/11/ciaran-clark-called-up-the-irish-squad/ |publisher=GreenScene |date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his debut on 8 February 2011 against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the [[Aviva Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0208/ireland_wales_carlingnationscup.html |title=Republic of Ireland 3–0 Wales |date=8 February 2011 |work=RTÉ Sport |accessdate=8 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211022530/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0208/ireland_wales_carlingnationscup.html |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2013, Clark scored his first goal for the Republic of Ireland, helping them to a 2–0 friendly victory against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref name="Republic of Ireland 2–0 Poland"&gt;{{cite news |title=Republic of Ireland 2–0 Poland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21313667 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Republic of Ireland's opening match at [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], Clark deflected a ball from [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] into his own net to level the scores. [[Wes Hoolahan]] had earlier given Ireland the lead but Clark's mishap saw them share the spoils as the match ended 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hytner |first=David (13 June 2016) |title=Republic of Ireland give up draw to Sweden with Ciaran Clark own goal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-sweden-euro-2016-match-report |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
