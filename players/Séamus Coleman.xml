'''Séamus Coleman''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|m|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|m|ən}} (born 11 October 1988) is an Irish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and is [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

Originally a [[Gaelic football]]er, Coleman started his association football career with amateur club St Catherine's in Killybegs. He joined [[League of Ireland Premier Division|League of Ireland]] side [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] in 2006 after impressing in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against them. He then made the move to England to sign for Everton in January 2009 for a £60,000 fee. In 2010, he spent half a season on loan with [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], helping them win promotion via the [[2010 Football League Championship play-off Final|Championship play-offs]], before returning to Everton where he has made over 200 appearances, and has been regarded as one of the league's top full-backs.

Coleman has been a senior international for the Republic of Ireland since 2011, acquiring over 40 caps. He won the [[2011 Nations Cup]] and was awarded the [[FAI International Football Awards#Under 21 International Player of the Year|FAI Under-21 International Player of the Year]] in both 2009 and 2010. He was selected for the Ireland squad at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] Ireland against both [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[France national football team|France]]. He was named the new Ireland captain in September 2016 following [[Robbie Keane]]'s international retirement.

Sligo Rovers coach [[Rob McDonald]] did not rate Coleman very highly as a player, telling him that he should join [[League of Ireland First Division]] club [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]].&lt;ref name="Hannigan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hannigan|first=Mary|title=No drama and no sulking for Coleman – just dreams of Brazil|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/no-drama-and-no-sulking-for-coleman-just-dreams-of-brazil-1.1517900|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=10 September 2013|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald departed Sligo Rovers in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finn|first=Stephen|title=McDonald departure leaves Sligo behind eight-ball|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/mcdonald-departure-leaves-sligo-behind-eightball-26269136.html|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=10 September 2013|date=6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Paul Cook (footballer)|Paul Cook]], of whom Coleman later said: "He made me feel like I was the best player in the League.

===Everton===
Following a recommendation by [[Willie McStay (footballer, born 1961)|Willie McStay]] to former teammate and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] manager [[David Moyes]], Coleman was signed by the [[Merseyside]] club for £60,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/good-deal-everton-fcs-seamus-3385779|title=We got good deal for Everton FC's Seamus Coleman says Sligo Rovers boss Paul Cook|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2009, ahead of other interest from [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/everton-to-sign-seamus-coleman-1661881|title=Everton to sign Seamus Coleman|work=Sunday People|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before playing a game for Everton, Coleman had to undergo surgery on a career-threatening infected blister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683662/new-blow-as-evertons-james-vaughan-undergoes-surgery|title=New blow as James Vaughan undergoes surgery|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|date=7 October 2009|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 22 October 2009 in the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] group stage in a 5–0 loss to [[S.L.
