'''Alfie Robert John Mawson''' (born 19 January 1994) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Fulham}} club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

He started his senior career with [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] from the youth ranks but spent his entire time on loan with four different clubs, including three separate loan spells with [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]] and winning the [[EFL League Two|League Two]] Player of the Year award with [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in 2015. He was transferred to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] after failing to record a League appearance with Brentford, and made 49 appearances during the one season there, helping the former to win promotion to the Championship. He signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 2016, and his second season there he featured in every Premier League match of the campaign but could not prevent the team from relegation.

Mawson has made six appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] and was called up for the [[England national football team|England]] squad in March 2018 but did not play in the two friendlies.
