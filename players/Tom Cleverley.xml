'''Thomas William Cleverley''' (born 12 August 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|Watford}} club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

After starting his career in the youth set-up at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], Cleverley joined Manchester United at the age of 12. Between 2007 and 2009 he played for Manchester United's reserve team, and occasionally in first-team [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly match]]es. Cleverley was [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the start of 2009, for whom he made his first [[English Football League|Football League]] appearances, helping the team secure the League One title and promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. He spent the [[2009–10 Watford F.C. season|2009–10 season]] on loan with Watford in the Championship, where he scored 11 goals in 33 league matches and was voted as their [[Watford F.C. Player of the Season|Player of the Season]]. On 31 August 2010, he joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on a season-long loan, where he scored four goals in 25 appearances and helped them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He returned to Manchester United for the start of the [[2011–12 Manchester United F.C. season|2011–12 season]] and made his first competitive appearance in the [[FA Community Shield]] victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. He won the Premier League with Manchester United in 2013.

Cleverley played for [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]], and later that year made his debut for the [[England national football team|England national team]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Cleverley was born in [[Basingstoke]], Hampshire,&lt;ref name=Hugman2010-11/&gt; but grew up in [[Bradford]], West Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Dream debut for Tom |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Dream-debut-for-Tom.aspx |publisher=Manchester United |page=1 |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012214131/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Dream-debut-for-Tom.aspx |archivedate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Hanson School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Famous Students |url=http://www.hansonoldstudents.org/links/ |publisher=Hanson Old Students Association |accessdate=15 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City's]] youth set-up, but joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as an 11-year-old trainee in July 2000.&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Cleverley exclusive: Why I was right to leave Manchester United and Everton|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/08/25/tom-cleverley-exclusive-right-leave-manchester-united-everton/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005–06 season, he made nine appearances for the under-18 team. He also received a taste of reserve team football when he was named on the bench for the team's 4–1 away win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 21 February 2006.&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester United's Wonderkid – Tom Cleverley: Do You Know Him?|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2292/editorials/2011/08/08/2610406/manchester-uniteds-wonderkid-tom-cleverley-do-you-know-him|publisher=Goal.com|date=8 August 2011|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearance for the reserves came in a 0–0 away draw to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] almost a year later, on 15 February 2007, by which time he had become a regular in the under-18 team. However, just over a month later, he suffered a long-term injury and was ruled out for seven months.&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=United kids can make Paul proud|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/united-kids-can-make-paul-989648|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to action in October 2007, playing for the reserves in a 1–1 home draw with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"/&gt; The 2007–08 season marked Cleverley's emergence as a regular in the Manchester United reserve team, making 21 appearances as the team went on to win both the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] and the [[Lancashire Senior Cup]], in which he scored in the final against Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glory for young Reds|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/glory-for-young-reds-962573|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored his first goals in a Manchester United shirt on 23 January 2008, when he scored both of United's goals in a 2–0 away win over Bolton Wanderers in the [[Premier Reserve League]]. His consistent performances for the reserves earned him the captaincy of the team in the absence of regular captain [[Sam Hewson]], as well as a nomination for the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award – he lost out to [[Richard Eckersley (footballer)|Richard Eckersley]].&lt;ref name="CleverleyGoal.com"/&gt;

In recognition of his performances for the reserves, on 24 July 2008, Cleverley was called up to the Manchester United first team for the remainder of their tour of South Africa and the match against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Trio join senior squad |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Trio-join-senior-squad.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=24 July 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054823/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Trio-join-senior-squad.aspx |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first-team debut against [[Kaizer Chiefs FC|Kaizer Chiefs]] in the final of the 2008 Vodacom Challenge, coming on in place of [[Rodrigo Possebon]] at half-time, before he scored the third of United's four goals just after the hour mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Report: Chiefs 0 United 4 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2008/Jul/Report-Chiefs-0-United-4.aspx?pageNo=3 |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |page=3 |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054812/http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2008/Jul/Report-Chiefs-0-United-4.aspx?pageNo=3 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to regular reserve team duty for the 2008–09 season, but was given a first-team squad number – 35 – when the first-team squad list was announced on 15 August 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=Reds squad numbers registered |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Aug/Squad-numbers-registered.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061947/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Aug/Squad-numbers-registered.aspx |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named on the bench for United's [[2008–09 Football League Cup|League Cup]] matches against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 3–1 Middlesbrough|url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7626743.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2008}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Lyon |title=Manchester United 1–0 Queens Park Rangers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7708789.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut on 19 January 2009 in a 2–0 away win over [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]], coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for [[Matty Fryatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yeovil 0–2 Leicester |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7816036.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleverley scored his first Leicester City goal few weeks later on 3 February 2009, in a 4–1 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walsall 1–4 Leicester City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7869349.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleverley then scored his second goal for the club on 7 March 2009, in a 4–0 win over [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Match report: Leicester City 4–0 Cheltenham Town|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/city-verdict-impressive-display-fires-clear-warning-chasing-pack/story-12065076-detail/story.html|newspaper=Leicester Mercury|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=16 August 2016}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two goals in 15 matches for Leicester, Cleverley's loan spell came to a premature end after he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anxious wait for Tom Cleverley|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/anxious-wait-cleverley/story-12048221-detail/story.html|newspaper=Leicester Mercury|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=16 August 2016}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Manchester United for treatment and underwent surgery on his shoulder on 2 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleverley sends message to fans |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~1607650,00.html |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=31 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403172603/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~1607650,00.html |archivedate=3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his loan had ended, Cleverley was presented with a medal on 24 April after Leicester secured their promotion as champions of [[EFL League One|League One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Champions picture special |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~1638777,00.html |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428152937/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~1638777,00.html |archivedate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the season, along with [[James Chester]] and [[Corry Evans]], Cleverley was nominated by Manchester United reserve team manager [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] for the Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bostock |title=Reserve Player of the Year |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2009/Apr/Reserve-Player-of-the-Year.aspx |publisher=Manchester United F.C. |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013014509/http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Reserves/Reserves-News/2009/Apr/Reserve-Player-of-the-Year.aspx |archivedate=13 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Watford====
After being featured and scored in the pre–season [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly match]] against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], Cleverley was told by [[Alex Ferguson]] that he would be loaned out to gain further first-team experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleverley's a wanted man|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cleverleys-a-wanted-man-926542|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 August 2009, Cleverley signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on loan, and was able to play in their match away to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watford seal Cleverley loan deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8206810.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started the match and was booked within four minutes of the start of the second half, but then sealed a 4–2 win with a goal in the second minute of injury time at the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nottingham Forest 2–4 Watford|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8195606.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored another goal on his home debut four days later, scoring Watford's second goal in a 2–2 draw with [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watford 2–2 Blackpool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8202363.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became Watford's joint-top scorer with the second goal in a 2–0 win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watford 2–0 Preston |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8341219.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he extended his loan deal at Watford until the end of the [[2009–10 Watford F.C. season|2009–10 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleverley commits |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1880013,00.html |publisher=Watford F.C. |date=20 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121120433/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1880013,00.html|archivedate=21 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleverley scored a further five goals in 20 appearances for Watford before a knee ligament injury in April 2010 ended his season prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watford midfielder Tom Cleverley out for season |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8610377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the team's [[Watford F.C.
