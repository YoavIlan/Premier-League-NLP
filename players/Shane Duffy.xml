'''Shane Patrick Michael Duffy''' (born 1 January 1992) is an Irish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].

He came through the youth academy at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], where he completed his development after being promoted into the senior squad, spending most of his time at the club out on loan. He joined [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in 2014 for an undisclosed fee, spending two years with the Lancashire club before moving to Brighton in 2016, where he earned promotion to the Premier League.

Born in [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, Duffy played for Northern Ireland at youth international level before switching allegiance to the Republic of Ireland. He made his debut for their [[Republic of Ireland national football team|senior team]] in 2014 and represented the country at [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

==Early life==
As a youth, Duffy played [[Gaelic football]] for [[Doire Colmcille CLG]] and association football for Foyle Harps, both based in [[Derry]]. He represented Northern Ireland at [[Northern Ireland national under-16 football team|under 16 level]] in the 2007 [[Victory Shield]] tournament and impressed Everton manager [[David Moyes]] in a performance at [[Bloomfield Road]] against [[England national under-16 football team|England]].

==Club career==
===Everton===
[[File:Shane Duffy Bohemians V Everton (17 of 51).jpg|thumb|Shane Duffy Bohemians V Everton (17 of 51)|Duffy for Everton]]

Duffy joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 2008 as a first-year scholar and worked his way through the U-18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/08-09/under18.asp|title=Everton Under-18s|date=2 May 2009|work=ToffeeWeb|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reserve teams. Manager [[David Moyes]] named him and several young players in the first team for the pre-season friendlies and Duffy scored his first Everton goal against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] in a 4–0 victory. He made his professional debut versus [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in December 2009, coming on for the injured [[Sylvain Distin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/fixturesresults/round=2000037/match=2000876/report=lu.html|title=Everton vs AEK Athens|date=2 December 2009|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Everton's next European fixture, Duffy made his home debut at [[Goodison Park]], completing the full 90 minutes against [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8415881.stm|title=Everton 0 – 1 BATE Borisov|date=17 December 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 December 2009|first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 Duffy got seriously injured after colliding with a goalkeeper during a training match. He had undergone emergency surgery after lacerating his liver, and losing over 3 litres of blood in what medical staff described as 'freak accident'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8699813.stm|title=Injured Shane Duffy thought he 'was going to die'|date=23 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 May 2010|first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Burnley====
Duffy joined [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on loan on 24 March 2011 on an initial 28-day loan with the possibility of an extension until the end of the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/9435322.stm |publisher=BBC Sport | title=Burnley complete Duffy loan move | date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy made his debut for Burnley on 2 April 2011 in the 2–1 defeat to Ipswich Town, playing the full 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10413~51912,00.html|title=Burnley 1–2 Ipswich|date=2 April 2011|publisher=Burnley FC|accessdate=2 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407090945/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10413~51912,00.html|archivedate=7 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Scunthorpe====
Duffy joined [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] on loan on 1 September 2011. He made his debut on 10 September against Sheffield United, winning the Man of the Match award. He made a total of 19 appearances for the Iron before his parent club recalled him on 5 January 2012, due to an injury to [[Phil Jagielka]], Everton's regular centre-back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.football365.com/everton/7413202/Duffy-recalled-from-Iron-spell | title=Duffy recalled from Iron spell | publisher=Football365 | date=5 January 2012 | accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Everton===
[[File:Shane Duffy.jpg|thumb|Duffy with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2011]]
Duffy made his [[Premier League]] debut at [[White Hart Lane]] on 11 January 2012, coming on as a substitute for the final 30 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.setanta.com/IE/Articles/2012/01/11/Tottenham-v-Everton/gnid-125643/ | title=Spurs move within three of summit | publisher=Setanta Sports | date=11 January 2012 | accessdate=12 January 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114051724/http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2012/01/11/Tottenham-v-Everton/gnid-125643/ | archivedate=14 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Everton's regular centre-backs, [[Sylvain Distin]] and [[Phil Jagielka]], injured for the next game three days later, Duffy made the first [[Premier League]] start of his career in a 1–1 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2009-2010/villa-v-everton_sto3102537/story.shtml | title=Everton make point at Aston Villa | publisher=Eurosport | date=14 January 2012 | accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Yeovil====
On 26 September 2013, Duffy joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on an initial month loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24291069 |title=Shane Duffy: Everton defender joins Yeovil Town on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy's loan was eventually extended for a further two months and he made a total of 14 appearances for Yeovil before returning to Everton on 27 December 2013. Duffy rejoined Yeovil on 1 January 2014 when the transfer window re-opened, joining on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25529010 |title=Yeovil Town: Everton's Shane Duffy to stay with Glovers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=1 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 1 September 2014, Duffy joined [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/news/article/rovers-complete-duffy-deal-1889248.aspx |title=Rovers Complete Duffy Deal |publisher=Blackburn Rovers F.C.|date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy lost out to [[Sam Byram]] after making it to the final 3-man shortlist for the December 2015 [[EFL Championship Player of the Month|Championship Player of the Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11715/10119136/anthony-martial-wins-pfa-fans-player-of-the-month-for-augustseptember | title=Sam Byram wins PFA Fans' Player of the Month award for December | publisher=[[Sky]] | date=5 January 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, during a league match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], Duffy scored 2 own goals and was later sent off in the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/17/shane-duffy-blackburn-cardiff-qpr-barnsley-championship|title=Shane Duffy bags two own-goals and sees red as Blackburn lose at Cardiff|last=Association|first=Press|date=2016-08-17|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 26 August, Duffy signed a four-year deal with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/shane-duffy-brighton-hove-albion-blackburn-rovers-3273273.aspx|title=DUFFY DEAL DONE|last=Camillin|first=Paul|date=26 August 2016|website=seagulls.co.uk|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier the same day, it had been reported by [[Daily Mirror|''The Mirror'']] that the transfer cost the ''Seagulls'' a club record fee of £4 million, after turning down an extension to his contract at Blackburn Rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/brighton-sign-blackburns-shane-duffy-8708319 | title=Brighton sign Blackburn's Shane Duffy in club record £4million transfer | work=mirror.co.uk/sport | date=26 August 2016 | accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy was an ever-present in Brighton's backline in his first season at the club, helping them gain promotion to the Premier League in 2016–17 by making over 30 league appearances for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=51537&amp;season_id=149|title=Shane Duffy 2016·17|work=Soccerbase|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer following Brighton's promotion, Duffy signed a new contract with the club, extending his stay on the south coast to June 2021.&lt;ref name=TrioNewDeals&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightonandhovealbion.com/news/2017/august/trio-sign-new-deals/|title=Trio Sign New Deals|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Northern Ireland===
Duffy was part of the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] youth set-up from the U16 level upward. An U17 regular, he was in the squad for their unsuccessful [[2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2009 European Championship]] qualifying campaign and scored the only goal of the match, a penalty, in the opening game against Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgium join flawless Austra|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under17/news/kind=1/newsid=753650.html|publisher=UEFA|date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 17, he was called up to the senior team in June 2009 for a friendly against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] but was an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/07/northern-ireland-italy-pisa|title=Experimental Northern Ireland side beaten by Italy in Pisa friendly|date=7 June 2009|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, he made his Northern Ireland U21 debut, playing the whole match and scoring in the 2–1 away loss to [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8194945.stm|title=Portugal U21 2–1 N Ireland U21|date=11 August 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duffy played several games in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification|2010 UEFA Under-19 Championship qualifiers]], scoring twice in a 4–0 victory over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-19 football team|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Northern Ireland national under-19 football team|Northern Ireland]]'s first win of the qualifying campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coleman and Duffy in international action|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/duffy-helps-u19-s-to-4-0-win.html|publisher=Everton FC|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
Duffy opted to play for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], for which he was eligible through his [[Irish nationality law|Irish nationality]]. Following a discussion with former international [[Liam Brady]], Duffy was called up to the Republic of Ireland training camp in May 2010. Everton formally informed the [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] of Duffy's change in allegiance,&lt;ref name=DonegalDream&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalsport/Shane-Duffy-follows-his-dream.6101022.jp|title=Shane Duffy follows his dream|last=Foley|first=Alan|date=25 February 2010|work=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Publishing|accessdate=16 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217195848/http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/donegalsport/Shane-Duffy-follows-his-dream.6101022.jp|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the player was called up for a training camp squad for the Republic of Ireland squad to take place in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100890:trapattoni-names-squad-of-23-for-summer-training-camp&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8|title=Trapattoni names squad of 23 for Summer Camp training|accessdate=26 April 2010|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the camp Duffy suffered a 'freak' injury, during a match between the Republic of Ireland development squad and the Ireland amateur side, when he collided with goalkeeper Adrian Walsh and had to undergo life saving surgery at the [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin|Mater Hospital]] after damaging his liver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0522/duffys.html|title= Shane Duffy undergoes emergency surgery|publisher=RTÉ Sport|date=22 May 2010|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was discharged six days later after making a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shane Duffy discharged from hospital|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101004:shane-duffy-discharged-from-hospital&amp;catid=1:senior-men&amp;Itemid=8|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was expected to take a number of months for him to recuperate and regain his fitness, Duffy returned to action in little over ten weeks after his injury and has since appeared for Republic of Ireland under-19 and under-21 squads. He was called up for the U21 friendly versus Portugal in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101607:king-names-u21-squad-for-portugal-friendly&amp;catid=3:under-21&amp;Itemid=11|title=King names U21 squad for Portugal friendly|work=FAI.ie|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players such as Duffy, [[James McClean]], [[Daniel Kearns (footballer)|Daniel Kearns]], [[Darron Gibson]] and [[Marc Wilson (Irish footballer)|Marc Wilson]] had represented Northern Ireland at youth level but later opted to play for Republic of Ireland. The [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] disputed the players' right to do so under [[FIFA]] rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish FA set to take player eligibility dispute to CAS|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8538702.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt the current rules were a "clear disadvantage over all other 206 Associations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IFA to bring case to Court of Arbitration|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0301/ifa_fai.html|publisher=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Football Association]] took a case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] with the hope of getting FIFA to 'uphold' the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first= Emmet|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0518/1224270599814.html|title=Duffy gets his chance to impress Trapattoni|work=The Irish Times |date=18 May 2010|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Duffy's name is often linked with this dispute and the IFA appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], his situation differs from that of players such as [[Darron Gibson]] because of his close family ties to [[Donegal]]. This means he would have been eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland wherever he was born.

On 13 February 2012, less than two years after sustaining a life-threatening injury, Duffy received a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad, replacing the injured [[Richard Dunne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/international/senior-men/102366.html|title=Duffy replaces Dunne in Republic squad|publisher=Football Association of Ireland|date=13 February 2012|accessdate=13 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517154321/http://www.fai.ie/international/senior-men/102366.html|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2012, Duffy was named in the provisional 26-man Republic of Ireland squad for the friendly fixture against Greece on 14 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efcfeelinblue.com/coleman-duffy-called-up-gibson-set-to-return/|title=Coleman &amp; Duffy called up, Gibson set to return?|publisher=Efcfeelinblue.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=9 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104024425/http://efcfeelinblue.com/coleman-duffy-called-up-gibson-set-to-return/|archivedate=4 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy received his next call-up on 9 May 2014 when he was included in the 32-man provisional squad ahead of friendlies against Turkey, Italy, Costa Rica and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3942/ireland/2014/05/09/4805745/oneill-announces-ireland-squad-for-summer-friendlies |title=O'Neill announces Ireland squad for summer friendlies |publisher=Goal.com|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duffy had his international debut in June 2014 lining up against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in a friendly in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/international/2014/0608/622423-duffy-keen-to-add-to-ireland-caps/ | title=Shane Duffy keen to add to Ireland caps after debut against Costa Rica | publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] | date=8 June 2014 | accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he made his second appearance for Ireland against Switzerland, winning the [[Man of the Match]] award, setting up [[Ciaran Clark]] for the only goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/ireland-switzerland-player-ratings-euro-2016/71431 | title=Player ratings: Shane Duffy the star as Ireland see off Switzerland 1–0 | publisher=sportsjoe.ie | date=25 March 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Doherty, Conan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.derrynow.com/sport/duffy-is-man-of-the-match-in-republics-win-over-switzerland/82788 | title=Duffy is Man of the Match in Republic's win over Switzerland | publisher=Derry Now | date=25 March 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was called up for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], but was an unused sub for the first two matches against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. In the final group game of the tournament Duffy came into the team and a heroic performance helped secure an historic victory against Italy to propel the Republic of Ireland into the last sixteen. He was sent off for a professional foul on [[Antoine Griezmann]] as the Republic of Ireland were knocked out Euro 2016, losing 2–1 to [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36569511|title=France 2–1 Republic of Ireland|date=26 June 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|via=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
