'''Kieran John Trippier''' (born 19 September 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] for {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Trippier started his career in the youth system at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] but failed to make the breakthrough to the first team, having two loans at [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. In 2011, he signed for Championship club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on a season-long loan which was made permanent in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He was named in the Championship [[PFA Team of the Year]] for two consecutive seasons in 2012–13 and 2013–14. In 2014, he secured promotion with Burnley to the Premier League as the team finished runners-up in the Championship. A year later, he signed for Tottenham for a £3.5 million fee.

Trippier also represented England at all levels from under-18 to under-21, featuring in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]] and [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. He made his senior international debut in June 2017 and was part of the team that reached the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].
