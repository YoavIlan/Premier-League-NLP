A left-footed player traditionally used as a central defender, he also plays left back.

==Career==
===Youth and college===
Born in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]], Ream was a 2005 NSCAA All-Midwest Region selection with his high school, [[St. Dominic High School (O'Fallon, Missouri)|St. Dominic]], and after finishing his career with 15 goals and a school-record 39 assists, was tabbed All-State, All-Conference and Class 2 Defensive Player of the Year in both 2004 and 2005, was a St. Louis Post-Dispatch All-Metro selection and garnered Archdiocesan Athletic Association Player of the Year honors following senior season. He helped lead St. Dominic to the 2004 Missouri Class 2 state title. Ream also played with academy club [[St. Louis Scott Gallagher Soccer Club|St. Louis Scott Gallagher SC]], winning national championships in 2003 and 2004.

Ream attended [[Saint Louis University]] where he was a regular figure as a defender for the [[Saint Louis Billikens]], earning NSCAA first-team All-Region and second-team All-Conference honors. During his college years Ream also played for [[Chicago Fire Premier]] in the [[USL Premier Development League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/teams/13381239/22315-13381307/10355035.html |title=United Soccer Leagues (USL) |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711123416/http://www.uslsoccer.com/teams/13381239/22315-13381307/10355035.html |archivedate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Red Bulls===

|quote="He has a future. I probably shouldn't say too much, but Ream has a chance to be a national team player. He's a center back who is comfortable and calm in possession of the ball. He plays a good passing game, he's an excellent passer. A European-type center back who, I think, reminds me of Rio Ferdinand in the Premier League. Ream is strong tactically and never stressed, and of course he's good in the air. He has a top-class attitude and spirit."
|source= -Red Bulls coach [[Hans Backe]] speaking about Tim Ream, March 17, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/red-bulls-coach-likes-one-young-defender-in-particular/ |work=The New York Times |first=Jack |last=Bell |title=Red Bulls Coach Likes One Young Defender in Particular |date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ream was drafted in the second round (18th overall) of the [[2010 MLS SuperDraft]] by [[New York Red Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mlsnet.com/mls/events/superdraft/2010/draft_tracker.jsp 2010 MLS SuperDraft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117173019/http://web.mlsnet.com/mls/events/superdraft/2010/draft_tracker.jsp |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His play during pre-season impressed many observers, including new coach Hans Backe who was pleased with his distribution and tactical awareness.

On March 20, 2010, Ream started and played the full 90 minutes for Red Bulls in a 3–1 victory against [[Santos FC]], which was the first match played at the new [[Red Bull Arena (Harrison)|Red Bull Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php?article_id=22956 |title=THE STARTING XI Salou, Kandji partner up top |publisher=Bigapplesoccer.com |date=March 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201611/http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php?article_id=22956 |archivedate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional debut on March 27, 2010, playing the full 90 in New York's opening game of the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010 MLS season]] against [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] that ended in a 1–0 victory for New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/gamecast?id=289679&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=USA.1 |title=Gamecast: New York Red Bulls v Chicago – Major League Soccer – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=March 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2010, he scored his first professional goal (and MLS goal) against the [[Colorado Rapids]] in a 3–1 win for [[New York Red Bulls]]. Ream ended his first professional season starting all 30 matches for New York and helped New York capture its second regular season [[2010 Major League Soccer|Eastern Conference]] title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/red-bulls-beat-revs-clinch-eastern-conference ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023070503/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/red-bulls-beat-revs-clinch-eastern-conference |date=October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon the conclusion of the 2010 season, he was named the team's Defender of the Year, and he was one of three listed candidates for [[MLS Rookie of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/10/12/new-york-red-bulls-2010-mls-season-awards-contenders |title=New York Red Bulls 2010 MLS Season Awards Contenders |publisher=New York Red Bull Official Website |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701205837/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/10/12/new-york-red-bulls-2010-mls-season-awards-contenders |archivedate=July 1, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/11/19/red-bulls-announce-2010-team-awards |title=Red Bulls announce 2010 team awards |publisher=New York Red Rulls Official Website |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322023644/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/post/2010/11/19/red-bulls-announce-2010-team-awards |archivedate=March 22, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Ream's second season in New York, he played and started in 28 of 34 matches during the regular season; he missed 6 matches largely due to international call-ups during the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

In December 2011, during the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] off-season, Ream spent a short time training with both [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] with permission from the Red Bulls to maintain his fitness during the winter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2074044/West-Brom-Bolton-warned-Tim-Ream.html |title=West Brom and Bolton warned off Tim Ream &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=December 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of January 2012, Bolton made a transfer offer of £2.5m for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Trotters move for American |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7415635/Bolton-launch-Ream-bid |title=Bolton launch Ream bid &amp;#124; Latest Football Transfer News |publisher=Sky Sports |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was accepted and after personal terms were agreed he received a work permit on January 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Holden welcomes arrival of fellow USA international |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11672/7452668/Ream-granted-work-permit- |title=Ream 'granted work permit' &amp;#124; Bolton Wanderers News, Fixtures, Results, Transfers |publisher=Sky Sports |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the start of the 2012–13 season, Ream was given the number 5 shirt, previously worn by [[Gary Cahill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-announced-5.6.12-217943.aspx |title=Squad Numbers Announced |publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227211807/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/squad-numbers-announced-5.6.12-217943.aspx |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given his first start of the 2012–13 season in a 2–0 loss against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burnley 2 – 0 Bolton Wanderers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221523 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=August 18, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was sidelined from the first team, due to losing his starting place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/glad-to-be-back-22.10.12-439687.aspx |title=Glad To Be Back |publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024221419/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/glad-to-be-back-22.10.12-439687.aspx |archivedate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was relegated to the substitutes bench. Despite this, Ream went on to make fifteen appearances.

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Ream was linked with a move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], a move that was denied by the club and Ream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US star Tim Ream ready to learn new trade with Bolton Wanderers |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10554989.US_star_Tim_Ream_ready_to_learn_new_trade_with_Bolton_Wanderers/ |publisher=The Bolton News |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing the first three matches as an unused substitute, he started as defensive midfielder for four matches in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tim looks for first team spot |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10634103.Tim_looks_for_first_team_spot/ |publisher=The Bolton News |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2014, he was forced to wear a protective mask in Wanderers games after a collision with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Charlie Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tim Ream injury sparks defensive dilemma at Bolton Wanderers |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10969799.Tim_Ream_injury_sparks_defensive_dilemma_at_Bolton_Wanderers/ |publisher=The Bolton News |date=January 29, 2014 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 2013–14 season, Ream played in the left–back position and center–back, where he established his partnership with [[Matt Mills]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dougie Freedman hails Bolton Wanderers standard bearers Matt Mills and Tim Ream |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10732074.Dougie_Freedman_hails_Bolton_Wanderers_standard_bearers_Matt_Mills_and_Tim_Ream/ |publisher=The Bolton News |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redeemed himself in the first team making 42 appearances.
