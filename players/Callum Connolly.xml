His versatility means he can also play anywhere across the back four of defence and in midfield.

==Career==
Connolly began his career at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and has earned representation at [[England national under-17 football team|England under-17]] and [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkbride|first1=Phil|title=Everton youngster Callum Connolly cuts holiday short to prepare for new season|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-youngster-callum-connolly-cuts-9582572|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 2016, he joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on a one-month loan deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton defender Callum Connolly joins Barnsley on one-month loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35717908|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut two days later, in a 3–1 win over [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the [[Bescot Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walsall 1 – 3 Barnsley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35675595|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connolly made his first Everton teamsheet on 16 April 2016, when he was named as a substitute for the 1–1 draw with Southampton, coming on as a second-half substitute for injured right-back [[Seamus Coleman]] to make his Premier League debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton debutants revel in 'dream come true' moment|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-debutants-revel-dream-come-11197134|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2017, Connolly signed on loan for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] until the end of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CALLUM CONNOLLY SIGNS ON LOAN FOR WIGAN ATHLETIC|url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/callum-connolly-signs-for-wigan-athletic-3516926.aspx|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=Wigan Athletic|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just hours later made his debut and scored both goals as Wigan beat [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton Albion 0–2 Wigan Athletic|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38539037|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2017-2018 season, Connolly played on loan for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the [[EFL Championship]]. Used largely in central midfield for the first time in his career,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/evertons-callum-connolly-tough-successful-14373121&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly returned to Everton at the end of the season, having played an impressive 36 matches, scoring four goals.&lt;ref name="evertonfc.com"&gt;http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/06/12/connolly-ready-to-hit-ground-running&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the  [[2018–19 Wigan Athletic F.C. season|2018–19]] season Connolly re-joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on loan, initially for the whole of the season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Callum Connolly: Everton youngster joins Wigan on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45130345 |website=BBC Sport |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 31 January 2019 he was recalled by Everton and sent on loan for the second half of the season to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Callum Connolly: Everton youngster leaves Wigan to join Bolton on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47081594 |website=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connolly was part of the England squad for the [[2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]], and started the first game, a 2–1 win against [[France national under-19 football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England hold off France fightback |url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2016/matches/round=2000598/match=2019792/postmatch/index.html|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=UEFA|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he sustained an injury in the second half of the match, and withdrew from the squad six days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CALLUM CONNOLLY WITHDRAWN FROM ENGLAND UNDER-19S SQUAD|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/Jul/18/callum-connolly-withdrawn-from-squad-180716|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=The FA|date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After also beating the [[Netherlands national under-19 football team|Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England pip Netherlands in added time|url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2016/matches/round=2000598/match=2019796/index.html|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=UEFA|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Croatia national under-19 football team|Croatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England finish group stage with third straight win|url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2016/matches/round=2000598/match=2019799/index.html|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=UEFA|date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to top the group, England were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals against [[Italy national under-19 football team|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy down England with Dimarco double|url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/season=2016/matches/round=2000599/match=2020324/index.html|accessdate=14 January 2017|work=UEFA|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
