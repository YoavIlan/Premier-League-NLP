'''Dazet Wilfried Armel Zaha''' (born 10 November 1992) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivorian national team]].

Zaha advanced into the Crystal Palace first team from their academy, in 2010. In January 2013, he transferred to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for an initial fee of £10&amp;nbsp;million, [[Alex Ferguson]]'s last transfer before his retirement at the end of the season. Zaha remained on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Palace until the end of the season, helping them return to the Premier League. After an unsuccessful 2013–14 season with Manchester United (partly spent on loan at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]), Zaha returned to Palace in August 2014 on a season-long loan, before rejoining the club on a permanent basis in February 2015.

Born in the Ivory Coast, Zaha grew up in England from the age of four. He made his debut for the [[England national football team|England national team]] in 2012. He made two non-competitive appearances for England, the last of which came in 2013, before switching his allegiances to the Ivory Coast ahead of the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]].

On 11 August 2013, Zaha made his debut for Manchester United in the [[2013 FA Community Shield]] against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].&lt;ref name=sb1314/&gt; He was included in the starting line-up and played 61 minutes before being replaced by [[Antonio Valencia]] as he won his first major honour in football.&lt;ref name=FACS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23565298 |title=Community Shield: Man Utd 2–0 Wigan |first=Tom |last=Rostance |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704152704/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23565298 |archivedate=4 July 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not play again until 29 October, starting in a 4–0 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the third round of the League Cup at [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United 4–0 Norwich City |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24619369 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Premier League]] debut was on 7 December in a 1–0 home loss to [[Newcastle United]], as a substitute for [[Nani]] shortly after his team conceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |title=Manchester United 0–1 Newcastle United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25164173 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2014, Zaha completed a loan move to Cardiff City for the remainder of the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] season after being left out of favour by manager [[David Moyes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transfer deadline day: Man Utd's Zaha joins Cardiff City on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25973209 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, following Moyes' sacking, Zaha said that he was never given a chance by the Scot. He contrasted his experience with that of [[Raheem Sterling]], another young attacker who was given a chance by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a difficult start. He also said that false and malicious online rumours about him had upset him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zaha: Moyes never trusted me |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/306745.html |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=ESPN FC |date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Crystal Palace===
====2014–15 season====
On 28 August 2014, Zaha agreed to a season-long loan deal with Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilfried Zaha rejoins Crystal Palace on loan from Man Utd |url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/2007971/wilfried-zaha-rejoins-crystal-palace-on-loan-from-man-utd |publisher=ESPN FC |date=28 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, in the first match of his loan, he scored a stoppage-time equaliser in a 3–3 draw at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |title=Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha scores last-gasp equaliser at Newcastle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/30/newcastle-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report |accessdate=30 August 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 August 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2015, the final day of the winter transfer window, Zaha's move to Palace was made permanent with the signing of a five-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. It also included a buy back clause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilf returns home |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/february/wilf-returns-home/ |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be in the region of £3&amp;nbsp;million, rising to £6&amp;nbsp;million with add-ons; Manchester United will also receive a percentage of the fee if Palace sell Zaha in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilfried Zaha 'glad to be back permanently' at Crystal Palace |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31099507 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaha played regularly for Crystal Palace throughout the season, finishing the season with four goals and two assists as Crystal Palace finished the league in 10th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilfried Zaha statistics |url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/85059/History/Wilfried-Zaha |publisher=Whoscored |date=10 December 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, Zaha was a regular for Crystal Palace in this season, making 34 appearances, scoring two goals and recording one assist, while Crystal Palace finished in 15th place.&lt;ref name=sb1516/&gt; He helped Crystal Palace reach the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], by playing in every match since the third round entry and scoring two goals along the way.&lt;ref name=sb1516/&gt; Zaha played the whole 120 minutes in the final, but could not help Palace to a victory, as Manchester United won 2–1.&lt;ref name=FAC2016&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36292265 |title=Crystal Palace 1–2 Manchester United |first=Phil |last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaha won the [[Crystal Palace F.C.

====2016–17 season====
On 26 December 2016, Zaha was declined a penalty in the closing minutes against Watford. Some speculated that Zaha had overplayed the foul or taken a dive. After the match Watford's mascot attempted to rile Zaha up by mimicking a dive in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/watford-mascot-harry-the-hornet-wilfried-zaha-video-diving-a7497211.html |title=Watford mascot Harry the Hornet captured on video diving behind Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha |first=Jack|last=De Menezes |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=27 December 2016 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/12/26/harry-hornet-order-mocking-wilfried-zaha-says-sam-allardyce/ |title=Harry the Hornet 'out of order' for mocking Wilfried Zaha after Watford vs Crystal Palace, says Sam Allardyce |first=Sean |last=Gibson |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=27 December 2016 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2017, Zaha scored the opening goal in the third minute of the Crystal Palace Hull city game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39833968 |title=Crystal Palace 4–0 Hull City |first=Neil |last=Johnston |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2017 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that simultaneously mathematically secured Crystal Palace's top flight status and relegated Hull City to the  Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170921155912/https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/24046/crystal-palace-safe-resounding-victory-relegated-hull-city/ "Crystal Palace mathematically safe"].

Despite their poor start, Palace stayed up with a game in hand under new manager [[Roy Hodgson]], with the combination between Zaha and fellow winger [[Andros Townsend]] a key factor.&lt;ref name = "move up front"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Adrian |title=Move up front makes Zaha a striking force |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/668140 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Premier League |date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Premier League: Crystal Palace and Stoke – how one stayed up and one went down |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44017358 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Palace survival depends on Zaha staying fit, says Townsend |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-cry-townsend/palace-survival-depends-on-zaha-staying-fit-says-townsend-idUKKBN1GV0NJ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Reuters |date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named their Player of the Year for the third time in a row, a feat only done before by goalkeeper [[Julián Speroni]].&lt;ref name=poty18&gt;{{cite news |title=Zaha Named Palace’s 2017/18 Player of the Year |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2018/may/zaha-named-palaces-201718-player-of-the-year/ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2018–19 season====
In Palace's first game of the new season on 11 August, Zaha scored the second goal of a 2–0 win at Fulham. It was his 23rd Premier League goal for the club, drawing level with [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] as their top scorer in the competition's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=Charlotte |title=Fulham 0–2 Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha on target in Palace win |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/fulham-vs-c-palace/390759 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen days later, with a consolation goal in a 2–1 loss at Watford, he overtook Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fayiga |first1=Kunle |title=Wilfried Zaha can truly be fulfilled at Crystal Palace |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ng/news/wilfried-zaha-can-truly-be-fulfilled-at-crystal-palace/w0120dqxwdkr1an8d8qjcjghy |accessdate=30 August 2018 |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring a winning goal against [[Huddersfield Town]] in September 2018, Zaha publicly complained about what he considered to be a lack of appropriate protection by referees against fouls, saying that he would need a broken leg before any action would be taken. Data proved that in the last five years, he was the second most fouled player in the league after [[Eden Hazard]].&lt;ref name=bysouth&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bysouth |first1=Alex |title=Wilfried Zaha: Is the Crystal Palace winger a target?

==International career==
Zaha was eligible to represent both the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[England national football team|England]], the former because he has Ivorian parents and it was where he was born, and the latter because it is where he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Stick with England, Pearce pleads with Palace wonderkid Zaha |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2109427/Stuart-Pearce-tells-Wilfried-Zaha-stick-England.html |location=London |newspaper=Daily Mail |first=Sami |last=Mokbel |date=2 March 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zaha was in good form for Crystal Palace under Hodgson ahead of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the manager said that he regretted not fielding the winger in a competitive game to tie him to England.&lt;ref name=brighton/&gt;

===Ivory Coast (2016–present)===
On 27 November 2016, the [[Ivorian Football Federation]] confirmed that Zaha had sent correspondence to [[FIFA]] to switch his international football allegiance from England to the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/10675387/wilfried-zaha-swaps-england-for-the-ivory-coast "Wilfried Zaha swaps England for the Ivory Coast"]. Sky Sports. 27 November 2016.

In January, Zaha was named in the Ivory Coast squad for the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38451141|title=Afcon 2017: Wilfried Zaha in Ivory Coast's final squad|publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2017|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut against Sweden in a friendly in [[Abu Dhabi]] on 8 January, being subbed on at half time and assisting [[Giovanni Sio]]'s goal in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/sweden-vs-ivory-coast/teams/368294|title=Internationals (Sky Sports)|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, against [[Uganda national football team|Uganda]] at the same venue, he made his first international start and scored his first goal in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref name=uganda/&gt; At the tournament in Gabon, the reigning champion Elephants were eliminated at the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations Group B|group stage]], with Zaha starting each game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ivory Coast 0–0 Togo |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38605798 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ivory Coast 2–2 DR Congo |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38605798 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morocco 1–0 Ivory Coast |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38646336 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Zaha can play as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] or as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].&lt;ref name="move up front" /&gt; In 2018, Adrian Clarke of the Premier League's website opined that he "offers more threat" as a frontman, going on to add that "his ultra-mobile combination with [Andros] Townsend generates more goals and points", citing "the speed, athleticism and unpredictable movement of the Zaha-Townsend axis is more difficult for opponents to contain".&lt;ref name="move up front" /&gt;

Zaha has been accused of [[diving (association football)|diving]], however Roy Hodgson, who managed him at club level for Crystal Palace and internationally [[England national football team manager|for England]], has stated: "Wilf Zaha does not dive for penalties. He gets knocked over sometimes – sometimes he gets knocked over or unbalanced without it being a penalty or a foul – because he runs at such speed and has such agility with the ball. But he certainly doesn’t dive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Hodgson warns ‘disgraceful’ Harry the Hornet over diving antics|agency=Press Association|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/24/roy-hodgson-warns-disgraceful-harry-the-hornet-over-diving-antics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson also said that Zaha's characterisation as a diver is because of a "campaign" and it causes fouls against him to be dismissed by referees.&lt;ref name=bysouth/&gt;
