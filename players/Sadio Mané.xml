'''Sadio Mané''' (born 10 April 1992) is a Senegalese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for {{English football updater|Liverpoo}} club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]].

Having begun his career with [[FC Metz|Metz]] in France, he transferred to [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in 2012. After winning the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga#Österreichische Fußball-Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] and [[Austrian Cup]] in [[2013–14 FC Red Bull Salzburg season|2014]], he was signed by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In [[2014–15 Southampton F.C. season|2015]], Mané set a new [[Premier League]] [[Premier League records and statistics|record]] for the fastest [[hat-trick]] when he scored three times in 176 seconds during a 6–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref name=trick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/16/southampton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report|title=Southampton’s Sadio Mané hits record hat-trick to rout Aston Villa|date=16 May 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to Liverpool in 2016 for a fee of £34 million, making him the most expensive African player in history at that time.&lt;ref name=BBC36642523/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eight things about the Premier League Africans|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37255038|agency=BBC News|date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since joining Liverpool, Mané among other achievements scored in the [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final]].

Mané has earned over 50 [[Cap (association football)|caps]] for Senegal since his debut in 2012, and represented the national team at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]], [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]], [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Sédhiou]], Sénégal, Mané started his career at the Académie Génération Foot, Senegalese football academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio MANE de passage à l’Académie Génération Foot|url=http://www.asgenerationfoot.com/site/?p=3424|publisher=Academie Generation Foot|language=French}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mané made his professional debut for [[FC Metz|Metz]] on 14 January 2012, coming on as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Kévin Diaz (footballer born 1988)|Kévin Diaz]] in the 75th minute of a 0–1 home defeat against [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] in [[Ligue 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metz 0–1 Bastia|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/01/14/france/ligue-2/fc-de-metz/sporting-club-de-bastia/1115285/|website=Soccerway|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 19 appearances in [[2011–12 Ligue 2|his first league season]], 12 as a starter, and scored a solitary goal in a 2–5 loss to [[EA Guingamp|Guingamp]] at the [[Stade Saint-Symphorien]] on 4 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metz 2–5 Guingamp| url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/05/04/france/ligue-2/fc-de-metz/en-avant-de-guingamp/1115453/|website=Soccerway|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metz were [[relegation|relegated]] to the [[Championnat National]] at the end of the season.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
[[File:RBS gegen Metz59.JPG|thumb|Mané (right) playing for [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in 2013]]

On 31 August 2012, Mané moved to [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] side [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] for the third biggest transfer fee that [[FC Metz]] had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio Mané transféré au Red Bull Salzburg|trans-title=Sadio Mané transferred to Red Bull Salzburg|url=http://www.fcmetz.com/article/Transfert/2012-08-31-17-25-55_sadio-mane-transfere-au-red-bull-salzburg.html|website=www.fcmetz.com|publisher=[[FC Metz]]|accessdate=2 September 2014|language=French|date=31 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103230754/http://www.fcmetz.com/article/Transfert/2012-08-31-17-25-55_sadio-mane-transfere-au-red-bull-salzburg.html|archivedate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Bullen im Kaufrausch|trans-title=The Bulls on a spending spree|url=http://www.news.at/a/red-bull-salzburg-die-bullen-kaufrausch-340805|website=www.news.at|publisher=news.at|accessdate=2 September 2014|language=German|date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was believed to be €4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://diepresse.com/home/sport/fussball/national/3840165/Salzburg_Wer-Geld-hat-kann-gross-einkaufen | title =Salzburg: Wer Geld hat, kann groß einkaufen | language = German | trans-title = Salzburg: Who got money, can go on a shopping spree | publisher = [[Die Presse]] | accessdate = 2 September 2014 | date = 17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first [[hat-trick]] for the club on 31 October, in a 3–1 away win at [[SC Kalsdorf|Kalsdorf]] in the third round of the [[Austrian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalsdorf 1–3 Salzburg|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/match/kalsdorf-vs-salzburg/1397693/lineups|website=Goal.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2013, he netted his first hat-trick in the Austrian Bundesliga, during a 3–0 win away to [[SV Grödig|Grödig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grödig 0–3 Salzburg|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/gr%C3%B6dig-vs-salzburg/1487388/preview|website=Goal.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored another treble on 7 May 2014 as Salzburg won 7–0 at [[SV Horn|Horn]] in the cup semi-finals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bulls in cup final after goal fest!|url=http://www.redbulls.com/en/fc-red-bull-salzburg/news/saison_2013_14/red-bulls-in-cup-final-after-goal-fest.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=[[Red Bull]]|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the season ended with the team winning a domestic [[Double (association football)|double]]. At the end of August 2014 Mané forced a transfer out of the club, by not coming to the training and to the most important game for Salzburg at that time to qualify for the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltfussball.at/news/_n1232661_/skandal-um-sadio-mane-vor-malmoe-spiel/ Skandal um Sadio Mané vor Malmö-Spiel], weltfussball.at, 26 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
====2014–15 season====
On 1 September 2014, Mané transferred to [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for £11.8 million, signing a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Southampton sign £10m forward Sadio Mane &amp; Toby Alderweireld |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29025087|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| accessdate=3 September 2014|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut 22 days later in a 2–1 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], winning the penalty for Southampton's first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arsenal 1–2 Southampton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29216769 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first league appearance for the club in another 2–1 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 27 September, starting and assisting [[Ryan Bertrand]] for the first goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29289926|title=Southampton 2–1 Queens Park Rangers|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club in an 8–0 victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 18 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reddy |first1=Luke |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29580147 |title=Southampton 8–0 Sunderland |work=BBC Sport |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was subsequently credited as an own goal by [[Patrick van Aanholt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton 8 – 0 Sunderland |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/matches/2014-2015/epl.match-stats.html/southampton-vs-sunderland|publisher=Premier League |accessdate=24 October 2014|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, score his first goal in his next game, a 1–0 win over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canavan|first1=Steve|title=Southampton 1–0 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29670448|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=26 October 2014|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December and January he scored in three successive matches, against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544147 |title=Crystal Palace 1–3 Southampton |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=26 December 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30566736 |title=Southampton 1–1 Chelsea |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=28 December 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30600817 |title=Southampton 2–0 Arsenal |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mané scored two late winning goals in 1–0 league victories at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 7 February 2015 and at home to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 3 March respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31071178 | title=QPR 0–1 Southampton | publisher=BBC Sport | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31598153 | title=Southampton 1–0 Crystal Palace | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=3 March 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mané had been dropped from Southampton's starting line-up for their 0–2 home defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 22 February as a punishment for being late to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton: Sadio Mane dropped for being late – Koeman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31579123|accessdate=22 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, during Southampton's final home match of the season, Mané scored three times in 2 minutes 56 seconds in a 6–1 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to set a new [[Premier League records and statistics|Premier League record]] for the fastest [[hat-trick]]. The record had been held since 1994 by [[Robbie Fowler]], who scored three against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 4 minutes and 33 seconds.&lt;ref name=trick/&gt; Mané finished the season with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions.

====2015–16 season====
[[File:Audi- quattro-Cup 23.JPG|thumb|Mané (right) playing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2015]]

Mané began the [[2015–16 Southampton F.C. season|2015–16 season]] by registering two assists in the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] third qualifying round first leg match with [[Vitesse Arnhem]] at home and scoring in the return leg, as Southampton eased through to the next round 5–0 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33667103 | title=Southampton 3–0 Vitesse Arnhem | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33738509 | title=Vitesse Arnhem 0–2 Southampton | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Sport | date=6 August 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, he took 39 seconds to open the scoring against Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, but the Saints eventually lost 6–1 at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 1–6 Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34918281|accessdate=2 December 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2016, he was again dropped from the starting line-up by manager [[Ronald Koeman]] for a match at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] when he turned up late for a pre-match meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sadio Mane: Southampton midfielder dropped for being late|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/35214588|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a straight red card on 12 March at the end of a 2–1 win at [[Stoke City]] for a collision into [[Erik Pieters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharpe|first1=Rich|title=Stoke City 1 Southampton 2: Ronald Koeman says his side will appeal against Sadio Mane’s red card|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-1-Southampton-2-Ronald-Koeman-says/story-28913551-detail/story.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=Stoke Sentinel|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was quickly overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton win appeal against Sadio Mane red card|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35803664|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadio Mane's claim against red card upheld by Commission|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/governance/2016/mar/sadio-mane-southampton-red-card-appeal-upheld|publisher=The FA|accessdate=15 March 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having failed to score in the league for over four months, Mané scored twice in a 3–2 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 20 March 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henson|first1=Mike|title=Southampton 3 Liverpool 2|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35796778|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 May 2016|date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by five goals in the next five matches, including a hat-trick in a 4–2 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=James|title=Southampton’s Sadio Mané in hat-trick romp against Manchester City|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report|accessdate=2 May 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season as Southampton's top scorer, with 15 goals in all competitions.

===Liverpool===
[[File:Liver-SM 2017 (11 cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Mané playing for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2017]]

On 28 June 2016, Mané joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for a transfer fee of £34 million on a five-year contract.
