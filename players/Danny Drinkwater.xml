At the end of the season, he was called up to the Manchester United first team for their [[dead rubber]] league match against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 24 May 2009. He was named on the bench, but did not take to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hughes |title=Hull 0–1 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048308.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 May 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loans====
To gain first-team experience, on 14 August 2009, Drinkwater joined [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on loan for the duration of the 2009–10 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drinkwater moves to Huddersfield |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/huddersfield_town/8201452.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club the very next day, coming on in the 72nd minute for [[Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1984)|Gary Roberts]] in a 3–1 win at home to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huddersfield 3–1 Southampton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8200493.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first goal for Huddersfield came three days later in a 7–1 home win over [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], five minutes after coming on as a 64th-minute substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huddersfield 7–1 Brighton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8205231.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start for Huddersfield in a 1–0 defeat at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] on 22 August.&lt;ref name=sb0910/&gt;

On 8 July 2010, Manchester United agreed for Drinkwater to spend a season-long loan spell at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. As they were under a transfer embargo at the time, Cardiff said that the move would be completed once this had been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man U youngster Daniel Drinkwater joins Cardiff on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8799988.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was eventually confirmed on 6 August 2010, once the embargo had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Embargo lifted, players registered |url=http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10335~2113888,00.html |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324115635/http://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10335~2113888%2C00.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinkwater's competitive debut for Cardiff two days later, in their 1–1 home draw with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on the opening day of the [[2010–11 Football League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardiff 1–1 Sheff Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8881637.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the loan having originally been intended to last the entire season, Manchester United recalled Drinkwater from Cardiff on 25 January 2011. During his time with Cardiff, Drinkwater made 12 appearances, including nine in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Drinkwater returns to Man United from Cardiff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/9373359.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
