Many panel members commissioned by ''[[The Guardian]]'' considered him to be one of the best players in the world in 2018.{{efn|A voting panel comprised 225 judges (coaches, broadcasters, reporters, correspondents, editors, and former players) from 69 countries (19 judges from Africa, 20 from Asia, 140 from Europe, 11 from North and Central America, and 35 from South America).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/dec/18/the-100-best-male-footballers-in-the-world-2018-nos-100-71 |title=The 100 best male footballers in the world 2018 |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=20 December 2018 |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Born and raised in [[Walthamstow]], Kane began his professional career at Tottenham Hotspur, where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, he was promoted to the senior team in 2009, at age 16. He did not initially feature for the side, and instead, was [[Loan (sports)|loan]]ed out several times to clubs across the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]], including [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].

Kane's involvement at Tottenham began to increase following the appointment of [[Mauricio Pochettino]] as head coach in 2014. In his [[2014–15 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|first full season]] at the club, Kane netted 31 goals across all competitions, and finished as the league's second highest goalscorer, winning the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award. After the [[2015–16 Premier League|following campaign]], at age 23, Kane finished as league's [[List of top Premier League goal scorers by season#2015.E2.80.9316|top goalscorer]], and guided the club to [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification. In the [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17 season]], Kane also completed the season as the league's top goalscorer, and helped the club finish as the competition's runners-up, while he won the [[PFA Fans' Player of the Year]] award. In the [[2017–18 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2017–18 season]], Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date, with 41 goals scored in 48 games in all competitions. 

Kane holds the record for most [[Premier League Player of the Month]] awards (six; shared with [[Steven Gerrard]]) and has been selected for the [[PFA Team of the Year]] four times. He established himself as Tottenham's fourth [[List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. records and statistics#Top 10 all-time scorers|all-time scorer]] in official competitions in January 2019, and holds the [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|best strike-rate]] (0.70 goals per game) in Premier League history. 

An English international, Kane has scored 20 goals in 35 games for his country. He has appeared and scored at every youth level, and made his senior debut in March 2015 at age 22, where he scored on his debut. Kane featured and scored at [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]], before he was selected as the squad's captain from May 2018, prior to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. In the tournament, Kane led England to fourth-place, their highest finish since 1990, by finishing as the top goalscorer, and won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Boot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44840817 |title=World Cup 2018: Harry Kane wins Golden Boot |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 July 2018 |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane's former youth coach [[Alex Inglethorpe]] has said of him:&lt;blockquote&gt;When he first came into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved slightly awkwardly, he was a bit cumbersome. But look closer, he had a lot of ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|holding midfielder]].&lt;ref name=jim/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While a teenager, Kane initially struggled in Tottenham's academy, as partially due to his date of birth in July, he was not as physically developed as other players, nor was he as quick.

When profiling Kane in February 2013, [[Talksport]] said that he was best as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position.&lt;ref name=talksport&gt;{{cite news |last=Roden |first=Lee |title=Is this Tottenham starlet the man to solve the club's striker crisis? |url=http://talksport.com/magazine/features/130204/tottenham-starlet-man-solve-clubs-striker-crisis-190960 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |publisher=Talksport |date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote that he preferred to place his shots, although he could also score from distance.&lt;ref name=talksport/&gt; The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich.&lt;ref name=talksport/&gt; Initially a back-up to £26&amp;nbsp;million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; Under Pochettino, Kane said that his game has improved through the tough training techniques instituted by the manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31852098 |title=Pochettino key to my improvement – Kane |date=13 March 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also strives to achieve marginal gain in order to maximise his potential by tweaking various aspects of his training and preparations as well as nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/harry-kane-england-marginal-gains |title=Harry Kane turns to kitchen rather than training ground for England recipe |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 October 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quoted=1|quote=He seems to have that natural ability to get goals. He's also young, fresh and his attitude appears to be very, very good. What I like about him, is that he is willing to run in behind defenders, as well as go short. When he gets opportunities he inveariably [''sic''] takes them. He wants to get his shot away very quickly, which is good to see. It looks as if he could have a very good future in the game.|source=— [[Alan Shearer]], the Premier League's all-time top scorer, on Kane in March 2015&lt;ref name=shearer&gt;{{cite news |title=Shearer on the Barclays Premier League's top four strikers |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/mar/090315-alan-shearer-on-diego-costa-sergio-aguero-harry-kane-charlie-austin.html |accessdate=9 March 2015 |publisher=Premier League |date=9 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311145830/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/mar/090315-alan-shearer-on-diego-costa-sergio-aguero-harry-kane-charlie-austin.html |archivedate=11 March 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Former Tottenham manager [[David Pleat]] described Kane as an "old-fashioned traditional centre-forward".&lt;ref name=mcnulty/&gt; [[Clive Allen]], who coached him at Tottenham, stated that "one thing I'd say about him, which unfortunately you don't say about a lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game. He loves football, he loves playing, he loves scoring goals".&lt;ref name=mcnulty/&gt; His former Tottenham under-21 coach [[Les Ferdinand]] likened Kane's movement to their former forward Teddy Sheringham, and the power and accuracy of his shots to Alan Shearer.&lt;ref name=jim/&gt;

Kane's style of play has been compared to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann, a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=Kevin |title=Harry Kane flattered by Jurgen Klinsmann comparisons |url=http://www.espnfc.com/tottenham-hotspur/story/2281527/harry-kane-flattered-by-jurgen-klinsmann-comparisons |accessdate=8 February 2015 |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Football Association]] chairman [[Greg Dyke]] named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; Shearer said that month that the three best strikers playing in the league were Kane, Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero.&lt;ref name=shearer/&gt;

After Tottenham's victory over Chelsea in January 2015, blogger Chris Miller wrote, "Nobody thought he was the guy who was going to give that performance against Chelsea".&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; In February 2015, [[BBC Sport]] wrote that Kane was best as a lone striker, with his "hold-up play and close control" making him apt in other positions as well.&lt;ref name=mcnulty&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Harry Kane: England's next number nine? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31395579 |accessdate=11 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, ''[[Match of the Day]]'' pundit [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] said that the England team should be built around Kane, stating, "I'm struggling to see a weakness in the lad's game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry Kane: Build England around striker – Murphy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31204958 |accessdate=8 February 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN FC|ESPN]] reporter Michael Cox stated that "Kane was initially considered a pure goal scorer, he's actually a good all-round player, often playing as an attacking midfielder", pointing out that during the 2018 FIFA World Cup "Kane's contributions in deeper positions were outstanding, his back-to-goal work as impressive as ever".&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;
