'''Alexandre Lacazette''' ({{IPA-fr|alɛksɑ̃dʁ lakazɛt}}; born 28 May 1991) is a French professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].

Lacazette came into prominence as a member of the academy at [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], where he made his professional debut aged 19. He helped the club win the [[2012 Coupe de France Final|Coupe de France]] and [[2012 Trophée des Champions|Trophée des Champions]] in 2012, and was named the [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|Ligue 1 Player of the Year]] in [[2014–15 Ligue 1|2014–15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crossan|first1=D.|title=LACAZETTE NETS HAT-TRICK AS OL WALLOP LILLE|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/lacazette-nets-first-hat-trick-as-ol-wallop-lille.htm|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=[[Ligue 1]]|date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in France, Lacazette cultivated a reputation as a prolific goalscorer and poacher, recording multiple twenty-goal seasons, which earned him a move to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in a then club-record £46.5&amp;nbsp;million (€53&amp;nbsp;million) deal in 2017.&lt;ref name="Arsenal F.C"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/alexandre-lacazette-agrees-join-arsenal|title= Alexandre Lacazette agrees to join Arsenal |date=5 July 2017|access-date=6 July 2017|website=arsenal.com|publisher=Arsenal F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since debuting for the national side, Lacazette has represented France across all youth levels. He was a key player in France's victory in the [[2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]], where he scored the match-winning goal in the final against Spain.&lt;ref name="ESPN FC"&gt;{{cite web|title=France calls on Alexandre Lacazette|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1457666/france-subs-in-alexandre-lacazette-for-injured-jeremy-menez|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made his senior international debut in June 2013, scoring his first goal in March 2015.

Known for dribbling, pace, and ability with both feet, as well as his persistence to press and tackle when out of possession, Lacazette has been compared to former Arsenal forward [[Ian Wright]] by [[Gérard Houllier]].&lt;ref name="metro.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/05/arsenal-transfer-target-alexandre-lacazette-is-like-ian-wright-says-gerard-houllier-6757159/|title=Alexandre Lacazette is like Ian Wright, says Gerard Houllier|website=Metro.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2017, Lacazette signed a reported five-year deal for Premier League club Arsenal for a club record fee;&lt;ref name="Arsenal F.C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Lyon disclosed that the fee was an initial €53&amp;nbsp;million (£46.5&amp;nbsp;million) plus up to €7&amp;nbsp;million (£6.1&amp;nbsp;million) in potential bonuses.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyonpress"/&gt; The fee was the largest ever received by Lyon from the sale of a player, beating the €41.5&amp;nbsp;million (£37.7&amp;nbsp;million) record set by [[Corentin Tolisso]]'s transfer to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] three weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="Lyonpress"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.actusnews.com/documents_communiques/ACTUS-0-49376-olg-050717-cession-a-lacazette-arsenal-gb.pdf|title=Transfer of Alexandre Lacazette to Arsenal|date=5 July 2017|access-date=6 July 2017|publisher=Olympique Lyonnais Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communiqué : Transfert de Corentin Tolisso au Bayern Munich {{!}} OLWeb.fr|url=http://www.olweb.fr/fr/article/communique-transfert-de-corentin-tolisso-au-bayern-munich-31268.html|publisher=Olympique Lyon|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee also surpassed the previous Arsenal record €50&amp;nbsp;million (£42.5&amp;nbsp;million) that Arsenal paid [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for [[Mesut Özil]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexandre Lacazette joins Arsenal for club record £46.5m from Lyon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40496970 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 July 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2017, it was reported that a verbal arrangement had been reached for Lacazette to join [[Atlético Madrid]] in the summer of 2017, but that fell through on 1 June 2017, after the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] upheld Atlético's ban on registering players for two [[transfer window]]s (1 January – 2 February 2017 and 1 June – 31 August 2017) that was imposed in July 2016 by [[FIFA]] on the club for breaching [[FIFA]] rules over the signing of minors.
