'''Martin Dúbravka''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈmaɾtin ˈduːbɾaʊ̯ka}}; born 15 February 1989) is a Slovakian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[Slovakia national football team]].

==Early life==
As a child, Dúbravka enjoyed playing ice hockey as well as football, and could have moved into the former sport were it not for a leg injury he sustained when he was five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/13/martin-dubravka-interview-hyperactive-ice-hockey-goalkeeper |title= Exclusive Martin Dubravka interview: From hyperactive ice-hockey goalkeeper to Newcastle cult hero – via a freak machete injury |work= Daily Telegraph |first=Luke |last=Edwards |date= 13 April 2018 |accessdate= 13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Dúbravka made his senior team debut in a 5–2 home win against [[MFK Dubnica|Dubnica]] on 26 May 2009. In the [[2009–10 Slovak Superliga|next season]] he played 26 [[Slovak Superliga|Corgoň Liga]] games, finishing as a league champion. He became a first choice after the transfer of [[Dušan Perniš]] in January 2010. He qualified with Žilina to the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]] and played all 6 group games. He kept a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Play-off round|play-off round]] against [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]].&lt;ref name=joinsparta&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fotbal.idnes.cz/liberecky-brankar-martin-dubravka-prestoupil-do-sparty-pjw-/fotbal.aspx?c=A170612_162313_fotbal_min|title=Další nováček ve Spartě, z Liberce přichází brankář Dúbravka|language=cs|work=idnes.cz|date=12 June 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2014, he signed a 3½ year deal with the [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Esbjerg fB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2048808.html|title=Esbjerg bring in Dúbravka from Žilina|first=|last=uefa.com|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dúbravka joined [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]] of the [[Czech First League]] in July 2016 on a one-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/fotbal-liberec-dubravka-0s0-/fot_pohary.aspx?c=A160728_2262637_fot_pohary_tof|title=Liberec ulovil brankáře Dúbravku.

===Newcastle United===
In January 2018, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest in Dúbravka, initially offering Sparta Prague a [[loan (sports)|loan]] for €500,000, with an option to sign in the summer for €4.5 million. He finally joined the [[Premier League]] side  on 31 January 2018, the final day of the [[List of English football transfers winter 2017–18|winter transfer window]] on a half-year loan deal, due to expire at the end of [[2017–18 Newcastle United F.C. season|2017–18 season]]. According to isport.cz, he joined the club for €2 million, with an option to sign in the summer for €4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sport.aktuality.sk/c/318531/newcastle-a-sparta-sa-dohodli-dubravka-mieri-do-premier-league/|title=Newcastle a Sparta sa dohodli, Dúbravka mieri do Premier League!|language=sk|author=SPORT.SK, s.r.o. &amp; Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia a.s.|publisher=|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He made his debut on 11 February, playing a pivotal role and keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He became the sixteenth Slovak player and only the second Slovak goalkeeper, after [[Ján Mucha]], to start in a Premier League fixture. After a very successful loan spell, he signed permanently for Newcastle on 30 May for an undisclosed fee of around 5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/magpies-confirm-permanent-d%C3%BAbravka-deal{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2019 in [[Durham, England|Durham]], Dúbravka was recognised as the Player of the Year 2018 by [[Football Writers' Association|North East Football Writers' Association]], joing the alikes of [[Alan Shearer]], [[Kevin Keegan]] or [[Shay Given]]. He became the 7th goalkeeper to win the award, in its 39 seasons. Dúbravka stated that he was happy to win the award because "amazing players have won this trophy before". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/dubravka-receives-north-east-football-writers-association-player-of-the-year-award|title=Dúbravka receives North East Football Writers' Association player of the year award|website=Newcastle United Football Club|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Dúbravka, a former [[Slovakia national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|under-21]] national player, was selected for the [[Slovakia national football team]] for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] home game against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

Dúbravka made his national team debut against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] on 23 May 2014 (2–0 win).&lt;ref name=debrep&gt;[http://sport.sme.sk/c/7213206/slovensko-vyhralo-nad-ciernou-horou-20-kozakovi-chybala-atmosfera.html Slovensko vyhralo nad Čiernou Horou 2:0, Kozákovi chýbala atmosféra], SME.sk, retrieved 25. 5. 2014 {{sk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, he played his first full game for the national team, having played 45 minutes in both of his previous matches. While he was benched against [[Uganda national football team|Uganda]] (1–3 loss), on 12 January he was fielded in an unofficial friendly match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. Slovakia lost the game 0–6, despite only trailing 0–1 at half time. This match also marked the first time Dúbravka conceded in the national team and he was also Slovak [[captain (association football)|captain]] for the game, being the most experienced with international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportinak.sk/online-prenos-pripravny-zapas-futbal--slovensko---uganda|title=Prípravný futbalový zápas: Slovensko prehralo s Ugandou 1:3|language=sk|website=www.sportinak.sk|date=8 January 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportinak.sk/online-prenos-pripravny-zapas-futbal--slovensko---svedsko-teraz|title=Slováci prehrali so Švédskom 0:6. To je niečo strašné, hovorí Kozák|language=sk|website=www.sportinak.sk|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his competitive debut in a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier]], against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] (2–1 win), on 10 June 2017, when the preferred goalkeeper in the qualification, [[Matúš Kozáčik]], was unavailable due to injury. He however achieved his first competitive clean sheet on 1 September in a home [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group F|qualifier]] against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. Slovakia won thanks to an 81st-minute goal by [[Adam Nemec]]. Just as in the previous [[cap (sport)|cap]], Dúbravka was chosen due to a prolonged injury of Kozáčik. After Kozáčik's return to the squad, Dúbravka remained preferred for the remaining matches against [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. In the match against Scotland, Dúbravka made a series of saves before he was finally beaten by an [[own goal]] from [[Martin Škrtel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/scotland/41525121 |title=Scotland still in it after dramatic late win over Slovakia |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Tom |last=English |date=6 October 2017 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ján Kozák's resignation incident===
Dúbravka was nominated for a double fixture against [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on 13 October and 16 October 2018, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportdnes.sk/futbal/trener-kozak-nominoval-na-cesko-a-svedsko-aj-skrtela-ci-pekarika-pozvanku-dostali-a-mladici-zo/|title=Tréner Kozák nominoval na Česko a Švédsko aj Škrtela či Pekaríka, pozvánku dostali a mladíci zo Serie A|work=SportDnes.sk|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the entirety of both games, but was also involved in an incident, that had led to resignation of [[Ján Kozák (footballer, born 1954)|Ján Kozák]], then Slovakia's longest-serving and most successful coach, who introduced him to the national team.

Dúbravka violated the code of conduct of national team players, along with [[Michal Šulla]], [[Norbert Gyömbér]], [[Ľubomír Šatka]], [[Milan Škriniar]], [[Vladimír Weiss (footballer, born 1989)|Vladimír Weiss]] and [[Stanislav Lobotka]]. On the night of 13 October 2018, after loss in Slovakia's second [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]] fixture and a derby match against Czech Republic (1–2), they left the hotel and went out, missed the bedtime and violated the wellness policy, regarding regeneration and rehabilitation. They were allegedly discovered by Ján Kozák at about midnight, admitting to the incident and apologising during the next day.
Ján Kozák resigned from the national team during the afternoon of 14 October, revealing the details of his decision in a press conference on 18 October, to avoid distractions during the preparation for the fixture against Sweden, that was managed by his former assistant [[Štefan Tarkovič]] on a caretaker basis. Kozák cited his inability to work with such squad under these conditions as the primary reason, as almost a third of the team was concerned, including players, those Kozák described as crucial, with Dúbravka being a part of this group. President of [[Slovak Football Association|SFZ]], Ján Kováčik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for future nominations and performances in the national team during the upcoming qualification cycle. During the press conference, Kozák also revealed that Dúbravka had claimed "difficult times at Newcastle" as one of the reasons for his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sport.sme.sk/c/20940265/online-jan-kozak-o-rezignacii-tlacova-konferencia.html|title=Kozák vymenoval hráčov, ktorí po zápase s Českom porušili večierku (minúta po minúte)|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=sport.sme.sk|access-date=2018-10-18|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October, SFZ published Dúbravka's official statement. He acknowledged that missing the bedtime was a violation, but maintained that the rest was within norms. He accepted any sanctions and stressed that the conduct was not aimed against Kozák, commenting that he regrets that Kozák didn't accept an apology from the trespassers. He also stated that Kozák's resignation surprised him, because of the good relations within the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futbalsfz.sk/sr-a-hraci|title=SR A – Všetci siedmi reprezentanti sa ospravedlňujú: Mrzí nás to, bola to chyba a budeme za ňu niesť následky|last=zväz|first=Slovenský futbalový|website=www.futbalsfz.sk|language=sk|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Dúbravka is a third-generation [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]: his father and grandfather also played in the position.&lt;ref name = "reluctant"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reluctant keeper Martin Dubravka makes right impression at Newcastle|first=Louise|last=Taylor|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=24 February 2018|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/23/martin-dubravka-goalkeeper-newcastle-bournemouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dúbravka has been dubbed the "quintessential sweeper-keeper" due to his "outstanding footwork" and he believes "in modern football the keeper's almost like a [[libero (football)|libero]]. You need to play with the ball, not just kick it long".&lt;ref name="reluctant" /&gt;

Louise Taylor of ''[[The Guardian]]'' christened Dúbravka the "reluctant keeper" after he admitted his favourite position to play is [[right winger (association football)|right wing]]; he sometimes plays as an outfielder in training and coaching staff have suggested that he switch to a [[midfielder|midfield]] role.&lt;ref name="reluctant" /&gt;
