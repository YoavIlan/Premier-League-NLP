Bournemouth| Bournemouth]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Bath, Somerset]], to former non-league striker Adie Mings, Mings joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2001 as an eight-year-old, but was released in 2009 when the youth budget was axed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/sport/8299798.FOOTBALL__Youngster_Mings_aims_for_England/ | publisher =This Is Wiltshire | accessdate =5 May 2013 | date = 29 July 2010 | title = Football: Youngster Mings aims for England}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Southampton, he attended [[Millfield]] school for two years on a football scholarship. After leaving school, Mings signed for non-league side [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]]. In the summer of 2012, he considered quitting football before eventually signing for his home town team [[Chippenham Town F.C.|Chippenham Town]].&lt;ref name="stuartjames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich|title=Tyrone Mings makes his mark at Ipswich on and off the pitch|author=Stuart James|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ipswich Town===
Mings signed for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2013 after a short trial for a fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]10,000 and an agreement for Ipswich to play a pre-season game against Chippenham.&lt;ref name="stuartjames"/&gt; &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22320506 | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate =4 May 2013 | date = 4 May 2013 | title = Burnley 2–0 Ipswich}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 2013, Mings made his debut for Ipswich on the last day of the [[2012–13 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2012–13 season]] against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He went on into the [[2013–14 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2013–14 season]] starting two more games due to the suspension of [[Aaron Cresswell]]. On 4 January 2014, Mings started an FA Cup tie against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at right back instead of his usual left back role.

Following [[Aaron Cresswell]]'s transfer to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], Mings was handed the number 3 shirt. Because of this, Mings offered to purchase new shirts for two fans who had bought shirts with his old number 15 printed on the back.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On transfer deadline day summer 2014, Mings was subject to a £3&amp;nbsp;million pound bid from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] which was rejected by Ipswich. On 20 September 2014, Mings signed a new three-year contract with Ipswich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29294717|title=BBC Sport – Tyrone Mings: Ipswich Town defender signs new contract|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2014, Mings won the Sky Bet Championship Player of the Month Award for September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/news/article/2014/20141009sepchampionshippotmrp-2007954.aspx|title=Ipswich Town full-back Tyrone Mings named Sky Bet Championship Player of the Month|author=The Football League|work=football-league.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 26 June 2015, Mings signed for newly promoted [[Premier League]] club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be £8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33293441|title=Bournemouth sign defender Tyrone Mings from Ipswich for £8m|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 June 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mings made his Premier League debut for Bournemouth on 29 August 2015 in a 1–1 draw with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. However, he suffered a knee injury six minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34025389|title=Bournemouth 1–1 Leicester|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 August 2015|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2015, it was confirmed that Mings' injury would mean that he would be sidelined for between 9 and 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34148465|title=Tyrone Mings: Bournemouth left-back's season over|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his comeback in a 3–0 defeat to [[Millwall F.C|Millwall]] in the third round of the [[2016–17 FA Cup|FA Cup]] on 7 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/bournemouth-eddie-howe-jordon-ibe-fa-cup-millwall-third-round|title=Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe calls Jordon Ibe a 'disappointment'|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=9 January 2017|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2017, Mings was banned by [[The Football Association|the FA]] for five matches following an alleged stamp on [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] in a match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the previous weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man United 1 Bournemouth 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/38604380|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 March 2017|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyrone Mings: Bournemouth defender to serve five-match ban|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39210644|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 March 2017|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Stuart|title=Anger at Bournemouth as Tyrone Mings gets five-match ban for violent conduct|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/08/bournemouth-defender-tyrone-mings-to-serve-five-match-ban|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=The Guardian|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aston Villa (loan)====
On 31 January 2019, Mings joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on loan for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transfer news: Tyrone Mings joins Aston Villa |url=https://www.avfc.co.uk/News/2019/01/31/transfer-news-tyrone-mings-joins-aston-villa |accessdate=31 January 2019 |work=Aston Villa F.C. |date=31 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Villa debut on 2 February against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. The match was the subject of controversy following an incident where Mings stepped on the face of Reading forward [[Nélson Oliveira]] after a tussle for the ball. Oliveira was forced off with deep gashes to his forehead and nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ref Watch: Dermot Gallagher ponders whether Tyrone Mings deliberately stamped on Nelson Oliveira? |first=Dermot |last=Gallagher |publisher=Sky Sports |date=4 February 2019 |accessdate=4 February 2019 |url= https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11627731/ref-watch-dermot-gallagher-ponders-whether-tyrone-mings-deliberately-stamped-on-nelson-oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medical&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/nelson-oliveira-tyrone-mings-stamp-face-watch-video-wife-instagram-aston-villa-reading-a8763056.html|title=Nelson Oliveira thanks medical staff for treatment on facial injuries as wife demands ban for Tyrone Mings |work=[[The Independent]] |date=4 February 2019 |accessdate=26 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/07/reading-release-shocking-new-footage-tyrone-mings-stamp-nelson-oliveira-8470189/amp/|title=Reading release shocking new footage of Tyrone Mings’ stamp on Nelson Oliveira |work=Metro.co.uk |date=7 February 2019 |accessdate=26 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mings later apologised, insisting that it was not intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tyrone Mings sends message to Nelson Oliveira after horrific stamp |work=Metro.co.uk |date=3 February 2019 |accessdate=4 February 2019 |url= https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/03/tyrone-mings-sends-message-nelson-oliveira-horrific-stamp-reading-star-8430745/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8339467/tyrone-mings-stamp-readings-oliveira-blood/|title=Tyrone Mings apologises after brutal stamp on Reading’s Oliveira leaves face streaming with blood |work=The Sun |date=3 February 2019 |accessdate=26 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As referee Geoff Eltringham had seen the incident and determined that it was accidental, no retrospective action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tyrone Mings: Aston Villa defender will not face action over Nelson Oliveira incident |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2019 |accessdate=4 February 2019 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47119805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mings scored his first Aston Villa goal in his second game, on 8 February 2019. He scored in the 82nd minute of the home game against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. At that point, Aston Villa had been losing 3–0, but they went on to complete a late comeback to draw the game 3–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47083170|title=Villa come from 3-0 down to deny Sheff Utd top spot|last=|first=|date=8 February 2019|work=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mings is the son of Adie Mings, a former striker with non-league [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]] and [[Gloucester City A.F.C.|Gloucester City]] who currently works as a scout for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/11277314/Tyrone-Mings-transfer-Why-Chelsea-hold-an-unusual-advantage-over-Arsenal.html|title=Tyrone Mings transfer: Why Chelsea hold an unusual advantage over Arsenal|date=6 December 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was assistant manager then manager at Chippenham Town, but became director of football shortly before Tyrone joined the club.

Off the field, Mings has gained a reputation for charitable and generous acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.twtd.co.uk/ipswich-town-news/22662/supporters-club-praise-for-generous-mings | publisher = twtd.co.uk | accessdate =26 December 2013 | date = 17 March 2013 | title = Supporters Club Praise for Generous Mings}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent Christmas Day 2013 feeding homeless people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.twtd.co.uk/ipswich-town-news/24276/mings-spends-christmas-day-feeding-homeless | publisher = twtd.co.uk | accessdate =26 December 2013 | date = 26 December 2013 | title = Mings Spends Christmas Day Feeding Homeless}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when he was given the number 3 shirt by Ipswich at the beginning of the [[2014–15 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2014–15 season]], he replaced the shirts of fans who had already bought ones with his old number on the back.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-28416351|title=Footballer Tyrone Mings vows 'to buy shirts for fans'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of football, Mings has a business interest in an interior design company in Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/15013542.The_designer_and_the_Cherries_star_bringing_luxury_to_Bournemouth___s_homes/ | publisher = dorsetecho.co.uk | accessdate =26 September 2017 | date = 15 January 2017 | title = KTM Design's Katie Thomas on the business she's set up with AFC Bournemouth player Tyrone Mings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
As well as being eligible for [[England national football team|England]], Mings is also eligible for [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]] through his paternal grandparents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twtd.co.uk/ipswich-town-news/23976/mings-could-be-towns-first-barbados-international/on-this-day|title=Mings Could Be Town's First Barbados International - Ipswich Town News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Adie turned down a call-up from Barbados during his own playing career.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/15675312.mings-would-potentially-consider-representing-barbados/&lt;/ref&gt;
