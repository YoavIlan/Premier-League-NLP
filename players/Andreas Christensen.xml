'''Andreas Bødtker Christensen ''' ({{IPA-da|ˈkʁɛsdn̩sn̩|pron}}; born 10 April 1996) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[centre back]] for {{English football updater|Chelsea}} club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]].

He began his career at [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] and joined Chelsea at the age of 15 in February 2012, making his professional debut in October 2014. From 2015 to 2017 he was loaned to [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]], where he made 82 appearances and scored 7 goals. Christensen made his full international debut for Denmark in June 2015, and represented the nation at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
====Early career====
[[File:Andreas Christensen.jpg|thumb|upright|Christensen playing for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2013]]

The son of former [[Brøndby IF]] goalkeeper Sten Christensen, he began his career with Brøndby IF. He spent eight years there, attracting the interest of Europe's elite clubs including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. On 7 February 2012, Christensen signed for Chelsea on a free transfer, near the end of [[André Villas-Boas]]' tenure as the club's manager. Upon joining the [[London]] side, Christensen said: "I have chosen Chelsea because they play the kind of football I like.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/02/07/2892141/chelsea-complete-signing-of-15-year-old-brondby-defender-andreas-|title=Chelsea complete signing of 15-year-old Brondby defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer|date=7 February 2012|website=Goal.com|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen was first included in a Chelsea senior squad for their last game of the [[2012–13 Chelsea F.C. season|2012–13 season]] on 19 May 2013, but did not feature in the match, which ended a 2–1 home win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in [[Rafael Benítez]]'s last match as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Owen|title=Chelsea 2–1 Everton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499152|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-season tour of the United States before the [[2013–14 Chelsea F.C. season|2013–14 season]], he was part of the senior team squad and signed a professional contract thereafter.&lt;ref name=chelsea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/andreas-christensen.html |title=Christensen Chelsea Profile |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815081559/http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/andreas-christensen.html |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014–15 season====
He made his professional debut on 28 October 2014, playing the full 90 minutes at right back as Chelsea won 2–1 away to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in the fourth round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Shrewsbury 1–2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29699744|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen did not play again until 24 January 2015, when he was utilized in the same position for Chelsea's 2–4 home defeat to [[EFL League One|League One]] team [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emons|first1=Michael|title=Chelsea 2–4 Bradford|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30860394|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christensen played no further part in the campaign, Chelsea won the League Cup with a 2–0 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in [[2015 Football League Cup Final|the final]]. When asked who was [[man of the match]] for the final, manager [[José Mourinho]] said "Man of the match was Andreas Christensen who played well against Shrewsbury. There are more than [[John Terry]] (the official Man of the match for the final) because we are a team. I am proud of the guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matic's kit, phone calls, but no party: Chelsea's cup celebrations|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31687889|accessdate=2 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2015, Christensen played for Chelsea U19 in the final of the 2014–15 [[UEFA Youth League]] against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] in Switzerland and although he scored an own goal to cancel out [[Izzy Brown]]'s opener in the first-half, Chelsea still ended with a 3–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefayouthleague/season=2015/matches/round=2000561/match=2016409/postmatch/report/index.html#brown+inspires+chelsea+youth+league+glory&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 24 May, replacing [[John Obi Mikel]] with 12 minutes remaining in a 3–1 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winton|first1=Richard|title=Chelsea 3–1 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32770811|accessdate=24 May 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christensen only made one league appearances out of the whole season, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica medal from his club for his contributions this season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/chelsea/story/2450893/jose-mourinho-every-chelsea-player-to-get-prem-medal |title=Every Chelsea player to get a Premier League medal says Jose Mourinho |publisher=ESPN |date=15 May 2015 |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loan to Borussia Mönchengladbach====
On 10 July 2015, Christensen joined [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] on a two-year [[loan (sports)|loan]] deal from Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German loan for Christensen|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/07/german-loan-for-christensen.html|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borussia.de/english/season/news/borussia-news/news-detailansicht.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=14343&amp;cHash=fdce92ddca7a52a6d25fe4c765c9add5
|title=Borussia bring in Chelsea's Andreas Christensen on loan|publisher=Borussia Mönchengladbach|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 10 August  against [[FC St. Pauli]] in the first round of the [[2015–16 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]], winning 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=St. Pauli vs. Borussia M'gladbach 1 – 4|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/10/germany/dfb-pokal/fc-st-pauli-von-1910-ev/borussia-monchengladbach/2038932/|website=Soccerway|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Christensen made his [[Bundesliga]] debut in a 4–0 loss at [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Borussia Dortmund vs. Borussia M'gladbach 4 – 0

After an impressive debut season, Christensen was voted the team's Player of the Season, ahead of [[Granit Xhaka]], the  team [[captain (association football)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/13/chelsea-prodigy-andreas-christensen-wins-borussia-monchegladbach-player-of-the-year-ahead-of-arsenals-granit-xhaka-5942365/|title=Chelsea prodigy Andreas Christensen wins Borussia Monchegladbach player of the year ahead of Arsenal's Granit Xhaka|website=Metro|publisher=Metro|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of his first season, Monchegladbach made multiple attempts to move his loan move into a permanent during the [[List of English football transfers summer 2016|2016 summer]], although it was reported Chelsea rejected the £14.25&amp;nbsp;million bid from the German side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10506225/chelsea-reject-borussia-monchengladbach-bid-for-andreas-christensen-sky-sources |title=Chelsea reject Borussia Monchengladbach bid for Andreas Christensen – Sky sources |date=19 July 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016–17 UEFA Europa League]], Christensen scored the final goal of a 4–2 win away to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in the second leg of the last 32 to assure a 4–3 aggregate win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiorentina 2–4 Borussia Mönchengladbach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39068922|accessdate=29 December 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on target again in the next round against neighbours [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]], who won on away goals after a 3–3 aggregate draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Borussia Monchengladbach 2 Schalke 2 (3-3 agg, Schalke win on away goals): Bentaleb penalty sends visitors through|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/borussia-monchengladbach-2-schalke-2-3-3-agg-schalke-win-away-goals-bentaleb-penalty-sends|accessdate=29 December 2017|website=FourFourTwo|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Chelsea====
On 12 August 2017, Christensen made his first appearance for Chelsea following his two-year loan spell in Germany, coming off the bench following captain [[Gary Cahill]] being sent off, in Chelsea's 3–2 opening day home defeat against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40835426|title=Chelsea 2–3 Burnley|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, he made his first Premier League start in a 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40914668|title=Tottenham Hotspur 1–2 Chelsea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2018, Christensen signed a new four-and-half-year deal with Chelsea running until 2022, after establishing himself in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christensen commits |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2018/01/christensen-commits-.html |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=9 January 2018 |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen made 40 appearances for the Blues in 2017–18, including three in the victorious [[FA Cup]] campaign. However, a back injury meant he was not involved in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Revealed: Why Andreas Christensen was not in Chelsea's squad for FA Cup victory over Man United |url=https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/christensen-chelsea-fa-cup-final-14680790 |publisher=football.london |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the season's finish, he was awarded the club's [[Chelsea Young Player of the Year|Young Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christensen: Great to play on the big stage |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2018/05/christensen--great-to-play-on-the-big-stage.html |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New manager [[Maurizio Sarri]] preferred to pair [[David Luiz]] and [[Antonio Rüdiger]] in central defence, and by February 2019 Christensen had made 15 appearances, only two of which in the league. However, he ruled out wanting to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burton |first1=Chris |title=Christensen had ‘doubts’ but never considered leaving Chelsea |url=https://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/christensen-had-doubts-but-never-considered-leaving-chelsea/1onure75w5lpv1lfg1tlqzis4y |accessdate=26 February 2019 |publisher=Goal.com |date=18 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
On 8 June 2015, Christensen made his senior international debut for [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in a 2–1 home friendly win against [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] at the [[Viborg Stadium]], as a 69th-minute substitute for [[Pierre-Emile Højbjerg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Allan|title=Pierre-Emile er vores panzerwagen!|trans-title=Pierre-Emile is our tank!|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/kommentarer/allanolsen/pierre-emile-er-vores-panzerwagen/5598839|accessdate=8 June 2015|newspaper=Ekstra Bladet|location=Copenhagn|date=8 June 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 2016, Christensen made his first Denmark start in a 2–1 victory over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], playing the full 90 minutes of the friendly at the [[MCH Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Denmark vs. Iceland (2 : 1) |url=https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/denmark-vs-iceland-lineup-24-473799?period=FullTime |publisher=OneFootball |date=25 March 2016 |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406031642/https://www.onefootball.com/en-US/match/denmark-vs-iceland-lineup-24-473799?period=FullTime |archive-date=6 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen played six matches in Denmark's successful [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. On 14 November 2017 he scored his first international goal to equalise in a 5–1 win over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in the second leg of the play-off.&lt;ref name=ireland/&gt; Manager [[Age Hareide]] called him up for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|final tournament in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Nicklas Bendtner left out of Denmark squad because of injury |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44350548 |accessdate=26 February 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He partnered [[Simon Kjær]] in central defence, having been able to play in that position due to [[Andreas Bjelland]]'s absence through injury, but played in defensive midfield in the final group game against [[France national football team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Sam |title=Andreas Christensen gives next Chelsea manager food for thought with commanding midfield display |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/06/26/andreas-christensen-gives-next-chelsea-manager-food-thought/ |accessdate=26 February 2019 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 16 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], he remained in midfield to combat the opponents' strength in that sector, but made an error that allowed [[Mario Mandžukić]] to equalise as the Croats went on to win on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Jack |title=Croatia vs Denmark, World Cup 2018: Andreas Christensen falls flat on his face in midfield audition – scouting report |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/croatia-vs-denmark-world-cup-2018-andreas-christensen-chelsea-analysis-manager-maurizio-sarri-a8425921.html |accessdate=26 February 2019 |work=The Independent |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Christensen is a [[centre back]]. In 2018, Chelsea manager [[Antonio Conte]] said the Dane had displayed "great maturity" adding that he has "a lot of trust in Christensen. This player is a player for the present for Chelsea, and for Chelsea's future for 10 or 12 years. He can also become the captain of this team in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea boss Antonio Conte backs Andreas Christensen to become club captain|first=Vaishali|last=Bhardwaj|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=24 February 2018|newspaper=London Evening Standard|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/antonio-conte-backs-andreas-christensen-to-become-chelsea-captain-a3774486.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
