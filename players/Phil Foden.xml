After he won the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup#Awards|FIFA U-17 World Cup Golden Ball]] award in [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup|2017]], Foden received significant media coverage.

On 17 December 2017, Foden was named the [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Stockport]], Greater Manchester and a boyhood supporter of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first%20team/first%20team%20news/2017/july/phil%20foden%20man%20utd%20v%20man%20city |title=City Starlet Foden: Silva's My Idol |date=20 July 2017 |publisher=Manchester City |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined at the age of eight and signed his [[Manchester City F.C. EDS and Academy|Academy]] scholarship in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/phil-foden |title=Manchester City U18's Phil Foden profile |publisher=Manchester City |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was privately educated at [[St Bede's College, Manchester|St Bede's College]], with his tuition fees being paid for by Manchester City.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ducker |first=James |date=3 August 2018 |title=Phil Foden may have gone from ballboy to 'Pep Guardiola's lad', but Man City's local hero remains firmly grounded |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/08/03/phil-foden-may-have-gone-ballboy-pep-guardiolas-lad-butman-citys/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pollard |first=Rob |date=11 May 2016 |title=Pivotal Man City moment that helped shape Blues' vision for their next generation |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-st-bedes-news-11311766 |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2016, City head coach [[Pep Guardiola]] included Foden in the matchday squad for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage match with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]; he was an unused substitute in the 1–1 home draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |date=6 December 2016 |title=Manchester City 1–1 Celtic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38202631 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guardiola said of Foden: "It’s dangerous to say good things about young players because they are still young, and they have to grow and they have to learn many, many things … But we have a lot of confidence to help him, because we believe he is a guy who has potential, even if he’s not strong, he’s not tall … I think he has absolutely good potential to be helped, and that is what we do."&lt;ref name="GoalSL"/&gt;

In July 2017, Foden was included in Manchester City's squad for the club's [[2017 International Champions Cup#United States|pre-season tour of the United States]], where he performed impressively in a 0–2 loss to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Handler |first=Paul |date=21 July 2017 |title=Guardiola: Foden display 'Another level' |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2017/july/phil-foden-pep-guardiola-manchester-derby |publisher=Manchester City |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also started in a 4–1 win over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clayton |first=David |date=27 July 2017 |title=City 4 Real Madrid 1 |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first%20team/match%20report/2017/july/city%20v%20real%20madrid |publisher=Manchester City |access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardiola stated after the Manchester United match: "It’s a long time since I saw something like this. His performance was another level. He’s 17-years-old, he’s a City player, he grew up in the academy, he loves the club, he’s a City fan and for us he’s a gift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2017/july/phil-foden-pep-guardiola-manchester-derby |title=Foden display 'another level' |date=21 July 2017 |publisher=Manchester City |access-date=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
