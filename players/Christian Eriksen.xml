==Club career==
===Early career in Middelfart and Odense===
Born in [[Middelfart]], Denmark, Eriksen followed in his father Thomas' footsteps when he started playing football in the academy of local side, [[Middelfart G&amp;BK|Middelfart]].&lt;ref name=makings&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/christian-eriksen-making-of-denmark-tottenham |title=The making of Christian Eriksen: from the start he was a ‘wow’ footballer |publisher=The Guardian |last=Ames |first=Nick |date=15 June 2018 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen's father was also one of the coaches at the time and in 2004 they helped the youth side finish unbeaten in the local youth championship for the third time in a period of four years.&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; The following year, he joined [[Odense Boldklub]] who competed in the Danish youth championships and within a year had helped the club to an age-group title. It was at OB that Eriksen first began showing signs of his technical ability, with his dribbling and free-kick techniques lauded by then-coach, Tonny Hermansen.&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; His form at youth level attracted the attention of a number of major European clubs, including the likes [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FC Barcelona kigger på OB-talent |date=4 April 2008 |newspaper=[[B.T. (tabloid)|BT]] |url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/fc-barcelona-kigger-paa-ob-talent |first=Niels |last=Hansen |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen ultimately underwent trials with both clubs as well as [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], but finally decided to move to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], stating, "My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=139277 |title='De eerste stap moest niet te groot zijn, Ajax was fantastische optie' |publisher=Voetbalzone |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ajax===

[[File:EriksenAjax3.jpg|thumb|Eriksen represented [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] between 2008 and 2013 during which time he helped the club to four [[Eredivisie]] titles.]]

On 17 October 2008, Eriksen signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with [[Amsterdam]]-based club, [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].&lt;ref name=uefastarlet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=762604.html |title=Danish starlet Eriksen opts for Ajax |publisher=UEFA |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transfer fee]] received by OB was estimated at €1&amp;nbsp;million (£847,199) while Middelfart also received a sum of €35 000 which they later used to construct a football pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/34596/_Wenger_eager_to_sign_up_Ajax_starlet_after_Bergkamps_endorsemsent_.aspx |title=Wenger eager to sign up Ajax starlet after Bergkamp's endorsemsent |website=Sport.co.uk |first=Nigel |last=Brown |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226101000/http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/34596/_Wenger_eager_to_sign_up_Ajax_starlet_after_Bergkamps_endorsemsent_.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=makings/&gt; He worked his way through the youth teams at Ajax and was promoted to the [[first team]] squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt.&lt;ref name=uefafaith/&gt; Later that month, he made his first team debut in a 1–1 [[Eredivisie]] with [[NAC Breda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eriksen fik debut i Ajax |language=Danish |date=17 January 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2010 |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]] |url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/2010/01/17/160629.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://talksport.com/uncategorized/100325/christian-eriksen-player-every-club-wants-ten-things-you-need-know/ |title=Christian Eriksen – The player every club wants: Ten things you need to know |publisher=talkSport |last=Mannion |first=Damian |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He scored his first goal for Ajax on 25 March in a 6–0 win over [[Go Ahead Eagles]] in the [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] and extended his contract with the club the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfvoetbal.nl/Overige/181292/Supertalent-Eriksen-tot-2014-bij-Ajax |title=Supertalent Eriksen tot 2014 bij Ajax |publisher=ELF Voetbal |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=11 March 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May, he played in the second match of the final of the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|2009–10 Dutch Cup]] as Ajax beat [[Feyenoord]] 4–1, prevailing 6–1 on aggregate.&lt;ref name=2010cup&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=291558&amp;cc=5739 |title=Report: Feyenoord Rotterdam vs Ajax Amsterdam&amp;nbsp;– Dutch Cup |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508052455/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=291558&amp;cc=5739 |archivedate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his first professional season with the club, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark.&lt;ref name=SW/&gt;&lt;ref name=debut/&gt; Eriksen's form throughout the campaign earned praise from manager [[Martin Jol]] who compared him to former youth products [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Rafael van der Vaart]] as well as Danish legend, [[Michael Laudrup]] for his reading of the game in the traditional [[Playmaker|"number 10" role]].&lt;ref name=uefafaith&gt;{{cite news |title=Eriksen puts faith in Ajax way by Berend Scholten |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1459745.html#eriksen+puts+faith+ajax |publisher=UEFA |date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imscouting.com/global-news-article/Christian-Eriksen-The-new-Laudrup/7979/ |title=Christian Eriksen: The new Laudrup |publisher=IMScouting |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–2013: Breakthrough years====

Eriksen took the number eight jersey ahead of the following campaign and began the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] well, scoring his first Ajax league goal on 29 August 2010 in an away victory over [[De Graafschap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/13/AJAX/article/detail/305683/2010/07/16/Ajax-maakt-rugnummers-bekend.dhtml |title=Ajax maakt rugnummers bekend |newspaper=Het Parool |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/08/29/netherlands/eredivisie/bv-de-graafschap/afc-ajax/941442/ |title=De Graafschap vs. Ajax |website=Soccerway |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next few months, he scored his first home goal at the 
[[Amsterdam Arena]], in a 3–0 Cup victory over [[SC Veendam|BV Veendam]], and his first European goal, in a 3–0 [[UEFA Europa League]] win over [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/11/11/netherlands/knvb-beker/afc-ajax/veendam-1894/1038712/ |title=Ajax vs. Veendam |website=Soccerway |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000129/match=2003770/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Ruthless Ajax make Anderlecht pay the penalty |publisher=UEFA |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the milestone goals, Eriksen was also named [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Danish Football Association's award|Danish Talent of the Year]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Landsholdet/2010/12/07/215702.htm |title=Christian Eriksen er Årets Talent 2010 |publisher=Danmarks Radio |first=Rikke |last=Darfelt |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; His growing capabilities as the team's playmaker saw him become an undisputed starter in the side and he helped Ajax to their first [[2010–11 Eredivisie|Eredivisie title]] in seven years. At the end of the season he was named Ajax's [[List of AFC Ajax records and statistics#AFC Ajax prize winners|Talent of the Year]].&lt;ref name=ajaxtalent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajax.nl/Nieuws/Nieuwsarchief/Nieuws-artikel/Stekelenburg-Ajacied-van-het-Jaar.htm |title=Stekelenburg Ajacied van het Jaar, Christian Eriksen Talent van het Jaar |publisher=AFC Ajax |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form throughout the campaign also earned him the [[Dutch Football Talent of the Year]] award which saw him become only the second Danish player to win the award since [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] in 1996. [[Johan Cruyff]], whose panel selected Eriksen for the award, described Eriksen as a typical product of the Danish school and added to previous comparisons between him and [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and Michael Laudrup."&lt;ref name=talentned&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1634341.html#janssen+voted+eredivisies+best |title=Janssen named Netherlands' finest |publisher=UEFA |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |first=Berend |last=Scholten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EriksenAjax2.jpg|thumb|Eriksen (right) playing for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in 2011.]]

On 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the [[UEFA Champions League]] when Ajax beat [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] 2–0 in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1642569#slide3 |title=Christian Eriksen to Liverpool: Tracking the Evolution of the Rumour |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Greene |first=Laura |date=17 May 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the return fixture the following month, he provided assists to teammates [[Gregory van der Wiel]] and [[Siem de Jong]] as Ajax recorded a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/matches/round=2000263/match=2007632/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Stylish Ajax eliminate Dinamo |publisher=UEFA |date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later he was named [[Danish Football Player of the Year]] in recognition of his role in helping Ajax to the league title the season before and in Denmark's successful [[UEFA Euro 2012]] qualification campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=den/news/newsid=1714527.html |title=Eriksen and Pedersen honoured in Denmark |publisher=UEFA |first=Peter |last=Bruun |date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen continued to impress for Ajax and his strong contribution, both in terms of goal and assist returns, helped the club to a second consecutive league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2601/features/2012/05/11/3095096/goalcoms-eredivisie-team-of-the-season-vertonghen-eriksen |title=Goal.com's Eredivisie Team of the Season: Vertonghen, Eriksen &amp; Dost make the cut |publisher=Goal |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriksen and Ajax repeated the feat in the [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13 season]] following which he opted not to renew his contract with the club. With only one year remaining on his current contract, Eriksen was permitted to search for a new club and he agreed terms with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in England. Eriksen departed Ajax having made 162 appearances across all competitions and scored 32 goals. Along with his league success, he had also featured in three consecutive editions of the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]], which Ajax won once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajaxshowtime.com/bijzaken-en-geruchten/72894/de-statistieken-van-ruim-vier-jaar-eriksen.html |title=De statistieken van ruim vier jaar Eriksen |publisher=Ajax Showtime |date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===

Eriksen played a key-role during the nation's qualification campaign during which time he scored eight goals to earn Denmark a play-off against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/great-dane-eriksen-is-danger-forireland-372f7gngj |title=Christian Eriksen is danger for Ireland |publisher=The Times |last=Hawkey |first=Ian |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leg of the play-off ended in a 0–0 home draw before Eriksen netted a [[hat-trick]] in [[Dublin]]'s [[Aviva Stadium]] in a 5–1 win to earn Denmark a spot at the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41884909 |title=Republic of Ireland 1–5 Denmark (agg: 1–5) |last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen's treble took his tally to 11 goals for the qualification campaign, bettered only by Poland's [[Robert Lewandowski]] (16) and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (15) in Europe, and earned the praise of national team manager [[Åge Hareide]] who stated that Eriksen was one of the top 10 players in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/17248/11127219/tottenhams-christian-eriksen-one-of-the-worlds-top-10-players-says-denmark-boss-age-hareide |title=Tottenham's Christian Eriksen one of the world's top 10 players, says Denmark boss Age Hareide |publisher=Sky Sports |date=15 November 2017 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark's opening match at the tournament, Eriksen assisted [[Yussuf Poulsen]] for the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] before scoring his first goal for the tournament in the 1–1 draw with [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/christian-eriksen-denmark-world-cup-2018-thomas-delaney-australia-a8411006.html |title=World Cup 2018: ‘Great things happen’ when you play alongside Christian Eriksen, Denmark’s shining star |publisher=The Independent |last=Miller |first=Nick |date=22 June 2018 |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark ultimately progressed from their [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group C|group]] after which they were drawn with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Round of 16|Round of 16]]. There they were defeated after a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]], with Eriksen being one of three players to have his spot-kick saved by Croatia goalkeeper [[Danijel Subašić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/01/croatia-luka-modric-christian-eriksen-denmark-world-cup |title=Croatia’s Luka Modric fluffs big line but still prevails in duel with Eriksen |publisher=The Guardian |last=Pender |first=Kieran |date=1 July 2018 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
