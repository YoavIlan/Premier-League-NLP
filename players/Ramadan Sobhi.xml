Sobhi was mainly used as a substitute in the competition, featuring in four games out of the six as Egypt lost in the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final|final]] to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="AFCON2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt 1–2 Cameroon|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38786537|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 he was named in Egypt's preliminary [[Egypt national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: All the confirmed squads for this summer's finals in Russia|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/440833652018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Sobhi is mostly used upfront on either wings, although he also can be used as an attacking midfielder or a secondary striker.&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;{{cite web|title=A new prodigy rises in Egypt|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/news/y=2016/m=6/news=a-new-prodigy-rises-in-egypt-2801871.html|website=FIFA|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His style of play, which combines dribbling, clinical passing, vision, and an eye for goal, made him dubbed on several occasions as the new [[Mohamed Aboutrika]], who is considered to be one of Egypt's greatest footballers.&lt;ref name="FIFA"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Speaking in February 2016, Sobhi stated that he supports Spanish side [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramadan Sobhy: I support Real Madrid|url=http://www.kingfut.com/2016/02/26/ramadan-sobhy/|website=King Fut|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Habiba Ekramy, sister of [[Al Ahly SC|Ahly]] ex-teammate and national teammate [[Sherif Ekramy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramadan Sobhy is engaged to sister of Sherif Ekramy|url=http://en.el-balad.com/2296782|website=Sada Elbalad|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
