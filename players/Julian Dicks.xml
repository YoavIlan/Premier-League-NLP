'''Julian Andrew Dicks''' (born 8 August 1968) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]], manager and former professional golfer. He is currently the manager of [[Isthmian League]] North Division club [[Heybridge Swifts F.C.|Heybridge Swifts]].

Playing from 1985 until 2002, he was a [[defender (association football)|defender]], notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was voted West Ham's player of the year four times between 1990 and 1997. He also played in the [[Football League]] for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] where he started his footballing career, ending it in 2002 in [[Non-League football|non-league football]] with [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]]. He became manager of [[Wivenhoe Town F.C.|Wivenhoe Town]] in 2009, before moving to [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] later that year. He was capped by both the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] and [[England B national football team|England B]] sides. He was known as a "hard man" adopting the nickname of [[The Terminator]]. He was a tough tackler with a strong shot in regular demand as a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] and free-kick taker. Dicks had a reputation for poor on-field discipline which brought him to the attention of referees, the press and footballing authorities.

==Early life==
Dicks was born in Keynsham Hospital, [[Bristol]] to mother, Carol and father Ron who worked as a fork-lift truck driver for [[Courage Brewery]]. Ron played non-league football with [[Keynsham Town F.C.|Keynsham Town]], [[Welton Rovers F.C.|Welton Rovers]], [[Frome Town F.C.|Frome Town]] and [[Shepton Mallet F.C.|Shepton Mallet]] whom he would also go on to manage. Dicks attended Novers Lane Primary School, in [[Knowle, Bristol|Knowle]], Bristol and Merrywood Boys Secondary School also in Knowle. At age 11 he was watched by former [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager, [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] who was [[Scout (sports)|scouting]] for West Ham United, but was turned down as he "was not quick enough". At age 13 he was spotted playing by Ron Veal who was scouting for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Veal recommended him to Villa manager, [[Ron Saunders]], however Saunders lost his job at Villa on 9 February 1982. When he was appointed as manager of Birmingham City nine days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=1090 | title=Ron Saunders&amp;nbsp;— Managerial statistics | publisher=www.soccerbase.com | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veal also changed his employer. Saunders was impressed when he watched Dicks play and he was offered a footballing apprenticeship with Birmingham City in 1982 when Dicks turned 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | pages=19–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Birmingham City===
He started his footballing career at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], aged 14, having moved from his home in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=brum&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham Legend For Europro Tour|url=http://www.theleader.info/article/6866/west-ham-legend-for-europro-tour/|publisher=www.theleader.info|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022085036/http://www.theleader.info/article/6866/west-ham-legend-for-europro-tour/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing as an apprentice he worked his way through the youth and reserve set-ups before making his debut in 1985 in a 2–0 away defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=brum/&gt; In 1988, he was signed by manager [[John Lyall]] for West Ham United, for £300,000, giving him the chance of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] football that Birmingham's relegation in 1986 had denied him.&lt;ref name=brum/&gt; Although Dicks had been [[Yellow card (sport)|booked]] 33 times and [[Red card (sports)|sent-off]] once in all competitions, in his four seasons with Birmingham City, Lyall identified potential in the player enthusing "There was a great touch there. I wouldn't have signed just a physical player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Ham United===
Dicks made his debut for West Ham on 2 April 1988 in a [[Football League Division One|Division One]] game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. West Ham lost the game 2-1.&lt;ref name="whustats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&amp;ham=192&amp;united=Julian_Dicks | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Julian Dicks | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to make eight appearances in the [[1987-88 West Ham United F.C. season|1987-88 season]], his first season with West Ham. The following season, he became a regular player and first choice [[left back]] for The Hammers, starting the first game of the season, a 4-0 away defeat to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and playing 34 of a possible 38 games that season.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; The season also saw his first goal for the club in a 2-1 defeat at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3626&amp;united=04_Feb_1989 | title=Game played 4 February 1989 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a poor season for West Ham who were relegated to [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] having finished one place off the bottom of the league in 19th place with 38 points.&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; Relegation had seen the sacking of manager [[John Lyall]] and the appointment of Scot, [[Lou Macari]]. The new manager and Dicks exhibited a poor working relationship from the outset.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ex-hammers.com/page.php?21 | title=Julian Dicks exclusively told; | publisher=www.ex-hammers.com | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, and with West Ham now playing second tier football, Dicks retained his left back position and became their regular [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taker following the exit of former first choice taker, [[Ray Stewart (Scottish footballer)|Ray Stewart]].&lt;ref name=whustats/&gt; Dicks became well known for his penalties. During his West Ham career he scored 35, missing four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/game-over-for-super-mario-balotelli-misses-a-penalty-for-the-first-time-in-his-career-so-where-does-the-italian-stand-among-the-other-spot-kick-greats-such-as-eric-cantona-and-matt-le-tissier-8835149.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=7 | title=Game over for Super Mario!

His first red-card was in a match versus [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the [[Football League Cup]] in the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3669&amp;united=22_Nov_1989 | title=Game played 22 November 1989 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an infamous encounter which included an on-pitch brawl between the opposing players. The fighting was sparked by a two-footed tackle by Wimbledon player, [[Dennis Wise]] on Dicks. Six players were booked with the game being described as "a disgrace to football" by journalist, [[Brian Woolnough]].&lt;ref name="Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham finished 7th in a season which saw the departure of Lou Macari and the appointment of former player, [[Billy Bonds]] as manager. Dicks and Bonds both had reputations as "hard men" and quarrelled frequently.&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

====Injury====
The [[1990-91 West Ham United F.C. season|1990-91]] season saw the start of Dicks' injury problems. On 13 October 1990, playing in a game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]], Dicks hit a dip on the edge of the pitch, his foot going over the edge resulting in a loss of feeling in his left leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to play but after the game he could barely walk. Against the medical assessment of John Green, who was soon to take over as club physiotherapist, he was told to "crash-on" and in the words of manager Bonds "if the knee goes, it goes". Green believe Dicks was in need of an operation on his knee [[cartilage]]. He was picked to play in the next game, against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] but lasted only 38 minutes. He played again in the next game on 24 October 1990, against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] but again had to be substituted. A knee operation followed and he would not play again until 21 December 1991 by which time West Ham had been promoted back to the First Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator: The Julian Dicks Story | page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another relegation and promotion====
He played in the second half of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]]. Despite his presence, the team finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and missed out on the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|first season]] of the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1992&amp;united=1st_Division_1991-92 | title=1st Division 1991-92 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]] was an eventful one for Dicks, mainly for the wrong reasons. He was sent off three times and picked up a string of bookings which saw him miss significant periods of the season and he was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Bonds. His first dismissal came after he threw his elbow into the face of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] player [[Franz Carr]].&lt;ref name=term154&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been no friction between the two players with Dicks saying of the incident "Not to this day do I know why I did it. I had it in my mind that I was going to elbow him, and that was it&amp;nbsp;— bang!".&lt;ref name=term154/&gt; Only four games passed before he was dismissed again. In a game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Dicks clashed with [[Paul Birch (footballer, born 1962)|Paul Birch]] and [[Steve Bull]] before being sent-off, with Billy Bonds having to stop him attacking Birch who was still on the ground.&lt;ref name=term156&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three months passed before his third dismissal of the season. In January 1993 after two bad fouls on [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] midfielder [[Ted McMinn]] he was sent-off, having to be escorted from the pitch by teammate [[Clive Allen]].&lt;ref name=term160&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his disciplinary problems he earned a Division One runners-up medal as West Ham reached the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--ups-and-downs-west-hams-joy-pitches-portsmouth-into-the-minefield-2322074.html | title=Football / Ups and Downs: West Ham's joy pitches Portsmouth into the minefield | work=The Independent | date=10 May 1993 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Haylet, Trevor | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his dismissals he played 34 league games of a possible 46 in the promotion season, scoring eleven goals, placing third in the list of highest goal scorers for that season behind only Clive Allen and [[Trevor Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1993&amp;united=1st_Division_1992-93 | title=1st Division 1992-93 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premier League and Liverpool transfer===
Now playing in the Premier League for the first time, West Ham struggled in their first seven games. New signing [[Simon Webster (footballer)|Simon Webster]] had a long term injury having had his leg broken by Dicks in a training session accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-reid-keen-to-capture-stewart-1486920.html |title=Reid keen to capture Stewart |first=Clive |last=White |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 July 1993 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow new signee [[Dale Gordon]] had failed to make the impression on the side his transfer had intended. In a move engineered by West Ham's then-Assistant Manager [[Harry Redknapp]], Dicks was transferred in order to bring in new players. Liverpool manager [[Graeme Souness]], on the recommendation of Redknapp, watched Dicks play in a West Ham match against Swindon Town on 11 September 1993. Souness thought Dicks to be "my kind of player" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signed him for Liverpool that week in a swap deal which involved [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]] and [[Mike Marsh (footballer)|Mike Marsh]] moving to West Ham. Extra money received by West Ham from the transfer was used by Redknapp to buy veteran [[Forward (association football)|striker]], [[Lee Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eofQ_6gjZK0C&amp;pg=PT109&amp;lpg=PT109&amp;dq=west+ham+dicks+marsh+burrows+chapman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0hohV66mYL&amp;sig=7NYlf-X8ihXtADyk7XVF0eAfJvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LbZVUsDiFuHsiAfJg4HYAg&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20ham%20dicks%20marsh%20burrows%20chapman&amp;f=false | title=Hammers in the Heart | author=May, Pete | isbn=978-1-78057-450-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks' signing had been part of an effort by Souness to "toughen up" the Liverpool team as he had planned to pair him with fellow hard man, [[Neil Ruddock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/souness-adds-new-hard-man-1.741508 | title=Souness adds new hard man | work=Herald Scotsman | date=18 September 1993 | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dicks debut on 18 September came in a high-profile game against local rivals, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]]. In an eventful game, Liverpool lost 2-0. Former West Ham players, [[Mark Ward (footballer born 1962)|Mark Ward]] and [[Tony Cottee]] scored with Dicks' mistake on the ball allowing Cottee to control it and score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1917 | title=Everton 2-0 Liverpool | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also memorable for the on-pitch fighting of Liverpool teammates [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Bruce Grobelaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1330070.stm | title=Football in-fighting | publisher=BBC Sport | date=14 May 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Austin, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now a regular in the Liverpool side Dicks scored his opening goal, a shot from 25 yards, in a 3-0 away win against [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in January 1994. His discipline had also improved and he had yet to be booked whilst in Liverpool colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/945 | title=Dicks repays an act of faith | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Dicks, Souness was proving to be an unpopular manager. He had dropped fan's favourites [[Ian Rush]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] to the reserve team due to perceived under performance and he had tried to integrate too many young and inexperienced players. In February 1994 after a shock [[FA Cup]] loss to Bristol City, a game in which Dicks did not play, the fans were calling for him to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1958 | title=Liverpool 0-1 Bristol City | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Souness left Liverpool after three years in charge, in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/articles/article/455 | title=Souness' Anfield agony | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Roy Evans]] who had always disliked Dicks and his style of play. Working under Souness he had kept his opinions to himself. Now with Evans as Liverpool manager Dicks' found himself out of favour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated197"&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks and Evans and his assistants [[Ronnie Moran]] and [[Steve Heighway]], disagreed over training methods, Dicks' fitness (they considered him to be overweight) and diet. Evans banished him to play with the reserve and to train with 15- and 16-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played for Liverpool on 7 May 1994 in a 2-1 away defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. It proved to be his last first-team game for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1958 | title=Aston Villa 2-1 Liverpool 1 | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-season of the [[1994-95 Liverpool F.C. season|1994-95 season]] started badly for Liverpool and for Dicks. Picked to play in a [[friendly match|friendly game]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at [[Burnden Park]] on 26 July 1994, Liverpool lost 4-1. Evans was again critical of Dicks' performance in the defeat; tired of such criticism he asked for a move from the club.&lt;ref name="autogenerated197"/&gt; He had played 28 games for Liverpool in all competitions, scoring three goals, although Dicks has the honour of being the last Liverpool player to score in front of the standing [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]] at [[Anfield]] in a 1–0 win against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] near the end of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/dicks/| title=PAST PLAYER PROFILE Julian Dicks| dead-url=yes| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525112209/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/dicks/ |archive-date=25 May 2007| website=www.liverpoolfc.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/289 | title=Player profile&amp;nbsp;— Julian Dicks | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Liverpool career lasted only 13 months, a short time considering his former manager Souness had said of Dicks, "if I was to pick the best 11 players I've ever worked with, he'd be one of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to West Ham===
On re-signing Dicks, manager [[Harry Redknapp]] commented that he believed that his chairman thought he "was off his rocker" because Dicks was considerably heavier than when he had departed for Liverpool a year earlier. His first game in his second spell for the Hammers, on 22 October 1994, saw a 2-0 home win against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and, in keeping with his reputation, Dicks was booked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=3925&amp;united=22_Oct_1994 | title=Game played 22 October 1994 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks played a major part in helping to keep West Ham in the Premier League in [[1994–95 West Ham United F.C. season|1994–95]] scoring five goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1995&amp;united=Premier_League_1994-95 | title=Premier League 1994-95 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1995–96 West Ham United F.C. season|1995–96]] saw him equal highest goalscorer, with Tony Cottee, for West Ham in the Premier with ten league goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1996&amp;united=Premier_League_1995-96 | title=Premier League 1996-97 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This season also included a game as goalkeeper in a game against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 19 December 1995. Dicks took over the goalkeeper's gloves after regular 'keeper, [[Ludek Miklosko]] had been sent-off for a foul on [[Daniel Amokachi]]. He let in two goals as Everton won 3-0. He was named Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/everton-revel-in-mikloskos-misery-1525409.html | title=Everton revel in Miklosko's misery | work=The Independent | date=19 December 1995 | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Hodgson, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1996–97 West Ham United F.C. season|1996–97]] he scored twice in a crucial London derby against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 24 February 1997 at [[The Boleyn Ground]] that West Ham won 4–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=4037&amp;united=24_Feb_1997 | title=Game played 24 February 1997 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game West Ham had not won in nine games.&lt;ref name=spurs43&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071018/spurs-lose-in-seven-goal-thriller_2236895_1328692 |title=Spurs lose in seven goal thriller |publisher=www.whufc.com |date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035520/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071018/spurs-lose-in-seven-goal-thriller_2236895_1328692 |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game signified the start of a fight back against relegation from the Premier League.&lt;ref name=spurs43/&gt;&lt;ref name="West HamvTottenham"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/joy-of-six-tottenham-hotspur-west-ham | title=The Joy of Six: Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2013 | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham had been in 18th place before the game but would go on the finish 14th at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1997&amp;united=Premier_League_1996-97 | title=Premier League 1996-97 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dicks in stone.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A commemorative stone for Dicks outside the [[London Stadium]]]]
Another knee injury resulted in him missing the entire [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]]. He did return to action in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]] and West Ham finished fifth to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]], but his injury problems failed to go away and he was restricted to just nine Premier League games. West Ham then terminated his contract and he retired from professional football after a 14-year career, 11 years of which had been spent at West Ham. In two spells at West Ham, he had played 315 competitive games and scored 64 goals, many of them penalties. His final appearance for the club came against Arsenal on 6 February 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2000 Dicks was granted a [[testimonial match]] by West Ham. On 13 August 2000 a West Ham eleven took on Spanish side [[Athletic Bilbao]] at the [[Boleyn Ground]]. The game was marred by a 17 player brawl in which West Ham player [[Igor Stimac]] was booked for a bad tackle and the West Ham captain for the day, [[Paolo Di Canio]], slapped several Spanish players in the face. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp was ordered to remove Di Canio for the pitch to defuse the tension. Bilbao coach, [[Txetxu Rojo]], was ordered to remove player [[Joseba Etxeberria]] for a similar reason. Bilbao won the game 2-1&lt;ref name="testimonial1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/879091.stm | title=Brawl mars Dicks' benefit match | publisher=BBC Sport | date=13 August 2000 | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testimonial2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jun/29/theknowledge.sport | title=When testimonials go bad | work=The Guardian | date=29 June 2005 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Dart, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicks received £200,000 from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34647441|title=Testimonials: 1D, injuries, fights... what's ahead for Wayne Rooney?|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canvey Island===
In 2001, he made a brief return to football after signing for non-League [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3018043/FA-Cup-Dicks-dreaming-of-return-to-the-big-time.html | title=FA Cup: Dicks dreaming of return to the big time | work=Daily Telegraph | date=3 December 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | author=Luscombe, Richard | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only ten days after signing for Canvey Island, he was involved in an FA Cup [[Upset (competition)|shock]]. Playing against [[Football League]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the first round of the competition, Canvey turned-out 1-0 winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1658794.stm | title=Wigan 0-1 Canvey Island | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=10 October 2013 | date=17 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-36777,00.html | title=Canvey's 'monster' win | work=The Guardian | date=18 November 2001 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success continued in the next round.

==International career==

Dicks made his debut for the [[England under-21 national football team|England under-21]] team in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland in a friendly game against the [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland under-21]] team on 28 May 1988. The game finished 1-1 with the England goal being scored by [[Paul Gascoigne]]. Dicks' performance convinced manager [[Dave Sexton]] to call him into the squad for the 1988 [[Toulon Tournament]]. He played in England's first game of the competition against the [[Mexico national under-20 football team|Mexico under-21]] team in the [[Stade Mayol]] in [[Toulon]] on 5 June 1988. He was sent-off for a foul on a Mexican player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/09/newsstory.sport7 | title=Hammer hardman with another set of irons in his soul | work=The Guardian | date=9 January 1999 | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undeterred by his sending-off, after missing one game through suspension, Sexton picked Dicks to play in the semi-final against the [[Morocco national under-20 football team|Morocco under-21]] team and for the final against the [[France national under-21 football team|France under-21]] team which England lost 4-2.
Four years later, in 1992, Dicks was called in to the [[England B national football team|England B team]]. He played only two games for the side; a 1-0 win in the [[Stadion Střelecký ostrov]] stadium, [[České Budějovice|Budweis]], Czechoslovakia against the [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] team and a 1-1 draw in the [[Luzhniki Stadium]], [[Moscow]] against the [[CIS national football team|CIS]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u21-intres86.html |title=England&amp;nbsp;— U-21 International Results 1986-1995 - Details |publisher=www.rsssf.com |accessdate=11 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125164210/http://rsssf.com/tablese/eng-u21-intres86.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/09/newsstory.sport7 | title=Hammer hardman with another set of irons in his soul | work=The Guardian | date=9 January 1999 | accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/MatchRslTmB.html | title=The B Team | publisher=www.englandfootballonline.com | accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 [[England national football team|England]] first team manager, [[Terry Venables]], was putting together a squad to compete in [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro96]] in England. Dicks' performances had earlier given rise to journalists to call for his inclusion in the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-le-saux-is-so-forward-thinking-1427295.html | title=Football: Le Saux Is So Forward Thinking | publisher=The Independent | date=6 March 1994 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Winter, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further disciplinary events ended such calls. On 11 September 1995 he was booked for stamping on the head of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[John Spencer (Scottish footballer)|John Spencer]] in a 3-1 home defeat for West Ham. Spencer required eight stitches in his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-year-of-men-behaving-badly-1527142.html | title=The year of men behaving badly | work=The Independent | date=23 December 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Moore, Glenn | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dicks-to-face-fa-disrepute-charge-1602074.html | title=Football: Dicks to face FA disrepute charge | work=The Independent | date=20 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Shaw, John | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16 September 1995 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] he was dismissed for the eighth time in his career for a foul on [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-rely-on-wright-1601553.html | title=Arsenal rely on Wright | work=The Independent | date=17 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Fox, Norman | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two incidents coming so close together caused the media to focus on the incident involving John Spencer. TV pundit [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]] and politician, radio journalist and Chelsea supporter, [[David Mellor]] called for [[The Football Association|FA]] to get involved. The game had been televised live on [[BSkyB|Sky TV]] and a recording of it was provided to the match referee, [[Robbie Hart]] who had booked Dicks during the game. [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] newspaper ran a full back-page on the incident with several pictures of the challenge and of blood on Spencer's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Terminator:The Julian Dicks Story | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellor's radio program, [[606 (radio show)|606]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eofQ_6gjZK0C&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=julian+dicks+john+spencer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I7tZUq2HG6S3igLDg4GAAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=julian%20dicks%20john%20spencer&amp;f=false | title=Hammers in the Heart | publisher=Mainstream Publishing | author=Pete May | isbn=978-1-78057-450-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; had focused so intently on the clash that combined with The Sun's coverage, public focus was sufficient for Dicks' daughters to be attacked at their school in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/match-bitterness-1601761.html | title=Match bitterness | publisher=The Independent | date=19 September 1995 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FA considered the video evidence provided and a report from referee Hart and Dicks was given a three-match ban.&lt;ref name=keane&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MAD+KEANE+HAMMERED+ME+BECAUSE+I+REFUSED+TO+SAVE+HIS+BUTT%3B+JULIAN...-a061153336 | title=Mad Keane Hammered Me Because I Refused To Save His Butt; Julian Dicks | publisher=www.thefreelibrary.com | accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban put in doubt any future involvement in England squads due to concerns over his indiscipline and although Venables watched him play in April 1996 he was not called into the Euro 96 squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-110832327 | title=Stage Set for Dicks to Impress Venables | newspaper=Daily Mail | date=13 April 1996 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Shepherd, Rob| url-access=subscription| via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 with [[Glenn Hoddle]] now manager of England, Dicks met, by chance, his assistant, [[John Gorman (footballer)|John Gorman]] whilst on holiday. Dicks claims Gorman had told him he would stand a better chance of being picked if he had grown his hair. Dicks frequently shaved his head sporting a [[skinhead]] hairstyle.&lt;ref name=keane/&gt; Gorman also said that Dicks had been a candidate for selection for a game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in 1997. By this time Dicks had said he no longer wished to be considered for international selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DICKS+CAN+BE+HODD'S+JULE!%3B+SAYS+HARRY+REDKNAPP.-a061102981 | title=Dicks Can Bb Hodd's Jule!; Says Harry Redknapp | publisher=www.thefreelibrary.com | year=1997 | accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
