'''Abdul Rahman Baba''', commonly known as '''Baba Rahman''' (born 2 July 1994) is a Ghanaian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] for [[Ligue 1]] side [[Stade de Reims|Reims]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and for the [[Ghana national football team|Ghana national team]].

Beginning his career at [[Dreams F.C. (Ghana)|Dreams FC]], he played in the [[Ghanaian Premier League]] with [[Asante Kotoko]]. In 2012, he signed for [[Bundesliga]] club [[Greuther Fürth]], where he spent two seasons. He then played for [[FC Augsburg]] before joining Chelsea in 2015 for a fee of £14 million, potentially rising to £22 million.

Rahman made his international debut in 2014 and was part of their squad which were runners-up at the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].

==Club career==

===Ghana===
Rahman began his career at [[Dreams F.C. (Ghana)|Dreams FC]] of the [[Ghana Football Leagues|Ghana Division Two]]. After impressive performances, he was then transferred on loan to [[Asante Kotoko SC|Asante Kotoko]] of the [[Ghanaian Premier League]] for one season.&lt;ref name="German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman" /&gt;

For the 2012 season, Rahman was a finalist for the league's Discovery of the Year Award, eventually losing to [[Joshua Oniku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Nii Adjei wins Player of the Season Award|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=242181|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a sought after player during his time with the [[Kumasi]]-based club, serious enquiries were made about the player by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] of the [[Premier League]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] of [[Serie A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsenal, Man City deals loom for Kotoko left-back Abdul-Rahman|url=http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/arsenal-man-city-deals-loom-for-kotoko-left-back-abdul-rahman/|publisher=GhanaSoccerNet|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
However, Rahman eventually signed with newly promoted [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|Greuther Fürth]] in the [[Bundesliga]] on 12 June 2012. Rahman stated that his decision to join Fürth was because the club offered, "the best conditions in which to develop my career."&lt;ref name="German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman"&gt;{{cite web|title=German club Greuther Furth beats Arsenal to sign Rahman|url=http://www.mtnfootball.com/africa/ghana/news/2012/june/13-german-club-greuther-furth-beats-arsenal-to-sign-rahman.html|publisher=MTN Football|accessdate=20 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707170745/http://www.mtnfootball.com/africa/ghana/news/2012/june/13-german-club-greuther-furth-beats-arsenal-to-sign-rahman.html|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the derby against [[1. FC Nürnberg]] on 11 August 2014 he scored his first two goals for Fürth in a 5–1 home victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doppelpacker Baba lässt das Kleeblatt tanzen|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/spieltag/2-bundesliga/2014-15/2/2407543/spielanalyse_spvgg-greuther-fuerth-82_1-fc-nuernberg-81.html|publisher=kicker.de|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he signed with [[FC Augsburg]] of the same division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baba-Wechsel zum FCA perfekt|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/vereine/609563/artikel_baba-wechsel-zum-fca-perfekt.html|publisher=kicker.de|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rahman's 2014–15 season with Augsburg, he made 108 tackles, more than any other player in the Bundesliga that season. Using aspects of his strength and pace, he was able to win 90 of those tackles, coming out to an 83% successful tackle rate. That season, Rahman also had 83 interceptions and won 80 contested aerial balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chelsea transfer news: Who is Baba Rahman?|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11795039/Chelsea-transfer-news-Who-is-Baba-Rahman.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
====2015–16 season====
On 16 August 2015, Rahman signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee, reported to be an initial £14 million, rising to a potential fee of almost £22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Baba Rahman moves to Stamford Bridge from Augsburg  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33953803 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Rahman signs  |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/08/rahman-signs.html |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Baba moves to Chelsea  |url=http://fcaugsburg.de/cms/website.php?id=/index/news/allenews/data21397.htm |publisher=FC Augsburg |date=16 August 2015}} {{dead link|date=February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dudko|first1=James|title=Baba Rahman Completes Transfer to Chelsea from Augsburg|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2529710-baba-rahman-transfer-news-latest-rumours-speculation-on-augsburg-defender|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 23 September in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–1 win away to [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walsall 1-4 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34265632|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Premier League]] debut in a 2–0 win over [[Aston Villa]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 17 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawkes|first1=Phil|title=Chelsea 2-0 Aston Villa|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34493710|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman has played an important role at left-back in a couple of Chelsea's victories including their 2–1 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] win over [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]; Sportsmail's Bob Treasure said that Rahman "was very lively at left back" and that he "showed excellent anticipation to make a handful of interceptions and start attacking moves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chelsea 2-1 Dynamo Kiev PLAYER RATINGS|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3304178/Chelsea-2-1-Dynamo-Kiev-PLAYER-RATINGS-Willian-shows-class-Baba-Rahman-catches-eye-Blues-clinch-Champions-League-win-Stamford-Bridge.html|website = Mail Online|access-date = 13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman also played the full 90 minutes against French side [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in Chelsea's 2–1 Champions League defeat on 16 February 2016. Rahman was presented with this opportunity following the injuries to centre-backs Kurt Zouma and John Terry. Although Chelsea failed to stop PSG from scoring twice, "Rahman looked like a class full back" according to Kristian Downer for Metro.co.uk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five things we learned from Chelsea's Champions League defeat in Paris|url = http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/17/five-things-we-learned-from-chelseas-champions-league-defeat-against-paris-saint-germain-5692170/ |website = Metro |accessdate = 20 February 2016 |first = Kristian Downer for |last = Metro.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baba Rahman 20160416.jpg|thumb|Baba Rahman playing for Chelsea in 2016]]
On 27 February, Rahman made an error which allowed [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[Shane Long]] to score in the 42nd minute; he was substituted for [[Kenedy (footballer)|Kenedy]] at half time but Chelsea eventually won 2–1 at [[St. Mary's Stadium|St. Mary's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Southampton 1-2 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35619625|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schalke 04 (loan)====
On 2 August 2016, Schalke confirmed that Baba Rahman has moved on a season-long loan to the club after failing to impress the new Chelsea manager [[Antonio Conte]] during pre-season. Baba was given the number 14 jersey for the upcoming season. His return to [[Bundesliga]] links him back with former Augsburg manager, [[Markus Weinzierl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2016/08/baba-makes-schalke-switch.html|title=Baba makes Schalke switch|last=|first=|date=2 August 2016|website=www.chelseafc.com|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schalke04.de/en/news/160802_baba/page/2362--86-86-.html|title=Abdul Rahman Baba joins S04 on loan|date=2 August 2016|website=www.schalke04.de|publisher=FC Schalke 04|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the completion of this loan move, Rahman told the local paper Ruhr Nachrichten, [[Antonio Conte]] advised him to leave on loan because he was mainly focused on a defensive philosophy. With the defensive focus, Rahman was told his playing-time would be very limited due to his attacking-style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/english-premier-league/story/2922205/baba-rahman-too-attacking-for-chelsea-manager-antonio-conte|title=Baba Rahman 'too attacking' for Chelsea manager Antonio Conte|last=Buczko|first=Stefan|publisher=ESPN|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman made his competitive debut for the [[Gelsenkirchen]] team on 20 August, as a winger instead of a defender in a 4–1 victory against [[FC 08 Villingen]] in the first round of the [[2016–17 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/08/20/germany/dfb-pokal/fc-08-villingen/fc-schalke-04/2244383/|title=Villingen 1-4 Schalke 04|date=20 August 2016|publisher=Soccerway}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his league debut on 27 August, coming on for [[Sead Kolašinac]] in the 62nd minute of an eventual 1–0 loss at [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] on the first day of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frankfurt hold on to beat Schalke|url=http://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/blmd1n-eintracht-frankfurt-1-0-fc-schalke-04-report.jsp|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Bundesliga|date=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman scored his first goal for Schalke on 15 September, the game's only in a Europa League victory at [[OGC Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nice 0-1 Schalke: Baba Rahman's late strike earns Schalke victory over Nice as Mario Balotelli fails to shine for Ligue 1 outfit|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3791677/Nice-0-1-Schalke-Baba-Rahman-s-late-strike-earns-Schalke-victory-Nice-Mario-Balotelli-fails-shine-Ligue-1-outfit.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|work=Daily Mail|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schalke 04 (second loan)====
In January 2018, Rahman joined [[FC Schalke 04]] on loan for the second time agreeing an 18-month stay until summer 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cann|first1=James|title=Chelsea left-back Baba Rahman joins Schalke on 18-month loan|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/chelsea-leftback-baba-rahman-joins-schalke-on-18month-loan-36543246.html|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Irish Independent|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bis 2019: Schalke leiht Baba erneut aus|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/715626/artikel_bis-2019_schalke-leiht-baba-erneut-aus.html|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=kicker Online|date=29 January 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reims (loan)====
In January 2019, he returned early to Chelsea and was immediately loaned to [[Stade de Reims]] until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baba Rahman loaned to Reims|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/1/28/baba-rahman-loaned-to-reims/|work=Chelsea FC|date=29 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Rahman played every minute of [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]'s campaign at the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[Equatorial Guinea]], providing the cross from which [[André Ayew]] headed in the winner against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] to win [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations Group C|Group C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa 1-2 Ghana|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30891882|accessdate=17 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations Final|final]] against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], Rahman scored in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] in which his team lost 9–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Alan|title=Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/feb/08/africa-cup-of-nations-final-ivory-coast-v-ghana-live|accessdate=17 August 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
