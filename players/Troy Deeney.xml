'''Troy Matthew Deeney''' (born 29 June 1988) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for and captains {{English football updater|Watford}} club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

Deeney started his professional career at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. He spent a brief spell on loan with [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Premier Division club [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] during the 2006–07 season. He transferred to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club Watford in 2010 and captained the team to promotion to the Premier League in the [[2014–15 Watford F.C. season|2014–15 season]].

==Early and personal life==
Deeney was born in [[Birmingham]], West Midlands,&lt;ref name="Hugman2010–11"/&gt; and grew up in [[Chelmsley Wood]]. He was one of three children born to his parents, who split up when he was 11. He was expelled from school when he was 14, before returning at the age of 15. He left at 16 without any GCSEs and began training as a bricklayer, earning £120 a week.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/12965798.From_Chelmsley_Wood_to_the_Premier_League__Deeney_s_journey_is_different_to_most/ |title=Troy Deeney speaks to Frank Smith about how he went from scoring seven times whilst drunk for Chelmsley Wood to captaining Watford into the Premier League |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |date=23 May 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2012, Deeney was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for kicking a man in the head during a brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/9780737.Deeney_sentenced_to_ten_months_in_prison/ |title=Watford striker Troy Deeney sentenced to ten months in prison for affray. |newspaper=Watford Observer |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/903262-watford-striker-troy-deeney-jailed-for-ten-months-for-kicking-man-in-head |title=Watford striker Troy Deeney jailed for ten months for kicking man in head |newspaper=Metro |location=London |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after serving almost three months of the sentence, after showing his remorse, and the fact that he was a first-time offender. Since his release from prison in 2012, he has earned GCSEs in English, Science and Maths.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt;

Deeney is married and has a son, Myles, and a daughter, Amelia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/1166857/watford-star-troy-deeneys-summer-wishlist-includes-a-new-contract-a-trip-to-disneyworld-and-a-new-car-park-space/ |title=Watford star Troy Deeney's summer wishlist includes a new contract, a trip to DisneyWorld and a new car-park space |newspaper=The Sun |first=Wally |last=Downes Jr |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=14 October 2016 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Ellis, is a semi-professional footballer who plays as a [[central midfielder]]. Ellis started his career at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], where he was captain of their academy team before being released. He has played for [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]], [[Hinckley United F.C.|Hinckley United]] and [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]] and now plays for [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]]. Ellis is a personal trainer, and Deeney helped fund his training in the profession.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt;

==Club career==
===Walsall===
Deeney was invited by the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] academy to take part in a four-day summer trial at the age of 15 with a view to earning a youth contract; however, he missed the first three days as he "knew there was a game on the last day" and was not offered terms by Villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/29/watford-troy-deeney-aston-villa-remi-garde |title=Watford's Troy Deeney gloats over 'better than dream goal' at Aston Villa |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Peter |last=Lansley |date=29 November 2015 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having joined [[Chelmsley Town F.C.|Chelmsley Town]], he was scouted by [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]'s Head of Youth Mick Halsall, who only attended the match Deeney was playing in because his son was also playing and due to the match he was scheduled to attend being postponed.{{fact|date=February 2019}} Deeney was playing while drunk,{{fact|date=February 2019}} but scored seven goals in an 11–4 win.{{fact|date=February 2019}} He was offered a trial by the then [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club, but only attended after his Chelmsley manager got him out of bed and paid for his taxi.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"/&gt; After signing for Walsall on 18 December 2006, Deeney was instantly sent out to [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] on loan for the rest of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name=Walsallprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saddlers.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10428~39532,00.html |title=Player profiles: Troy Deeney |accessdate=24 August 2010 |publisher=Walsall F.C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811093408/http://www.saddlers.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10428~39532,00.html |archivedate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first professional competitive goal for Walsall against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in a 2–1 win in September 2007.&lt;ref name=sb0708/&gt; This turned out to be his only goal of the 2007–08 season, and the 2008–09 season started similarly, with him managing only two goals in the first half of the season. However, the introduction of [[Chris Hutchings]] as manager coincided with Deeney finding a goalscoring touch. Helped by the fact that his new manager started playing him in his favoured striking position, instead of on the right wing as the previous manager [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]] had, Deeney scored nine goals in Hutchings' first 12 matches in charge.&lt;ref name=Walsallprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=sb0809/&gt; On 9 September 2009, it was announced that Deeney had signed a new two-year deal until 2011.&lt;ref name=Walsallcontract&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/walsall/8245994.stm |title=Deeney pens new Saddlers contract |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009–10 season, Deeney scored 14 goals to finish as Walsall's top scorer and was awarded the club's Player of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8893741.stm |title=Watford sign striker Troy Deeney from Walsall |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watford===
====2010–2012: Making the breakthrough====
On 4 August 2010, Deeney handed in a written transfer request amid interest from several Championship clubs. He had been told he was to leave Walsall earlier in the summer, and had slackened his pre-season training in protest at the club's hardline stance when trying to sell him.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; He signed for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] two days later for an initial fee of £250,000 rising up to £500,000 on a two-year contract that lifted his salary from £1,200 to £6,000 a week.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; On the same day Deeney signed for Watford, he played a part in their 3–2 win against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on the opening day of the season, coming on for [[Marvin Sordell]] in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8880936.stm |title=Norwich 2–3 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney found his poor pre-season meant he struggled for fitness in comparison to his new teammates.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview"/&gt; He scored his first Watford goal against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the first round of the League Cup on 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/8936586.stm |title=Watford 1–2 Notts County |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney went on to make 40 appearances for Watford in his first season, scoring three goals from 20 starts, although he was mainly deployed on the wing by [[Malky Mackay]].&lt;ref name=sb1011/&gt;

At the beginning of the [[2011–12 Watford F.C. season|2011–12 campaign]], Deeney initially found it hard to acquire a starting spot in the team as many of his early season matches saw him consigned to a bench role.&lt;ref name="Smithinterview" /&gt; He soon found his way into the starting eleven and amassed a total of 46 appearances under the management of [[Sean Dyche]] in his preferred position as striker.&lt;ref name=sb1112/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punditarena.com/football/english-football/playon/troy-deeney-leading-front/ |title=Troy Deeney: Leading From The Front |website=Pundit Arena |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney finished the season as Watford's top goalscorer with 12 goals in all competitions and also won the Goal of the Season Award for his goal against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2760211,00.html |title=2011/12 Awards: Goal Of The Season |publisher=Watford F.C. |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508075202/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2760211,00.html |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–2015: Prolific scoring form====
[[File:Deeney Cowie.jpg|thumb|upright|Deeney (left) playing for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in 2012]]

Deeney made his first appearance for Watford, after his release from prison, against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Vicarage Road]] on 22 September 2012. The match finished 2–2, with Deeney coming on in the second half and hitting the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19615300 |title=Watford 2–2 Bristol City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the next match against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on 29 September, and scored the winner from a spot kick in the 3–2 away win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19684243 |title=Huddersfield 2–3 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a memorable double against his boyhood club, Birmingham City, as Watford ran out 4–0 winners on 16 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21448127 |title=Birmingham 0–4 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Deeney signed a new contract with Watford, keeping him at the club until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/21714650 |title=Troy Deeney: Striker commits future to Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney netted another [[2 (number)#In sports|brace]] in a 4–0 win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 20 April 2013, taking his tally to 18 for the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22133456 |title=Watford 4–0 Blackburn |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, he scored his 19th goal of the season in the next match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], scoring the first goal in an important 2–1 away win for Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22211936 |title=Leicester 1–2 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Jonathan |last=Jurejko |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2013, Watford faced [[Leicester City]] in the play-off semi-final second leg at Vicarage Road. In one of the most dramatic ends to a play-off match in history, Deeney scored a goal deep into injury time to qualify for the [[2013 Football League Championship play-off Final|Championship Play-off final]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]]. After [[Manuel Almunia]] saved a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taken by [[Anthony Knockaert]] and a rebound, Watford charged down to the other end, and Deeney lashed in the winning goal in the seventh minute of added time – an ecstatic Deeney [[Goal celebration|celebrated the goal]] by jumping into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/10052075/Watford-3-Leicester-City-1-agg-3-2-match-report.html |title=Watford 3 Leicester City 1 (agg 3–2): match report |first=Tom |last=Prentki |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring 20 goals in the 2012–13 season, Deeney scored the only goal as Watford beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 1–0 in the opening match of the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23474781 |title=Birmingham City 0–1 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 August 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later on 10 August, Deeney scored a hat-trick as Watford thrashed [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] 6–1 at Vicarage Road. In doing so, he became the first ''Hornets'' player to score a hat-trick in a match since [[Michael Chopra]] in 2003, and the first one to do so at Vicarage Road since [[David Connolly]] on 7 December 1996. It was also Deeney's first career hat-trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23558547 |title=Watford 6–1 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2013 |accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netting a brace in a 4–1 win away against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on 29 March 2014, Deeney took his [[2013–14 Watford F.C. season|2013–14 season]] tally to 20 goals. In the process, he became the first Watford player to score 20 or more goals in consecutive seasons in all competitions since [[Luther Blissett]] managed the feat in 1983.&lt;ref name="watfordobserver"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/11112602.Deeney_landmark_as_four_goal_Watford_finally_win_away/ |title=Troy Deeney scores 20 goals for second consecutive season as Watford end 14-match winless streak on road at Sheffield Wednesday |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Anthony |last=Matthews |date=29 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeney scored again, this time against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a 1–1 draw on 5 April 2014, to become the first Watford player to score 20 league goals in consecutive seasons since [[Cliff Holton]] managed the feat in 1961.&lt;ref name="watfordobserver2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/11129524.Hornets_held_by_promotion_chasing_Clarets/ |title=Scott Arfield cancels out early Troy Deeney strike as Burnley earn potentially priceless point at Watford |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Anthony |last=Matthews |date=5 April 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The striker won both the Watford Player of the Season award for 2013–14 and also won the Players' Player of the Year at the end of season awards on 2 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140508-deeney-post-awards-1542668.aspx |title=DEENEY: "A Real Honour" |publisher=Watford F.C. |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=19 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517123110/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140508-deeney-post-awards-1542668.aspx |archivedate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of Manuel Almunia, Deeney was named the Watford [[Captain (association football)|captain]] by manager [[Giuseppe Sannino]] prior to the [[2014–15 Watford F.C. season|2014–15 campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/11360687.Watford_name_Deeney_captain/?ref=mr |title=Watford name Leicester City and Burnley transfer target Troy Deeney as captain |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|2014–15 Championship season]], Deeney helped Watford earn promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/watford/11563292/Watford-promoted-to-Premier-League.html |title=Watford promoted to Premier League |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process he became the first player in Watford history to score 20 or more goals in three consecutive seasons (2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/12875432.Troy_Deeney__From_a_prison_cell_to_making_Watford_FC_history_in_three_years/ |title=Troy Deeney believes going from a prison cell to making Watford FC history shows his turnaround as a player and a person |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Frank |last=Smith |date=7 April 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2016, Deeney signed a new five-year deal with Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36683381 |title=Troy Deeney, Isaac Success &amp; Christian Kabasele agree Watford deals |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his [[2016–17 Watford F.C. season|2016–17]] goalscoring account on 10 September at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]'s new home venue, the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|London Stadium]], equalising in a 4–2 comeback victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37263970 |title=West Ham United 2–4 Watford |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Ian |last=Woodcock |date=10 September 2016 |accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney scored his 100th Watford goal in all competitions on 26 December 2016 with a penalty in a 1–1 home draw against Crystal Palace, ending a ten-match goalless run. He became the fifth player to reach a century of goals for Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38361127 |title=Watford 1–1 Crystal Palace |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Matthew |last=Henry |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
In October 2015, Deeney revealed that he had twice rejected invitations to play for [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica internationally]] and that he harboured an ambition of playing for [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/13809247.Deeney_reveals_he_has_twice_been_approached_to_play_for_Jamaica/ |title=Troy Deeney has revealed he has twice been offered the chance to represent Jamaica but the Watford captain has England ambitions |newspaper=Watford Observer |first=Adam |last=Newson |date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeney originally believed he was eligible to play for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] but that possibility was quickly ruled out as neither his parents nor grandparents are from Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/watford/12142797/Troy-Deeney-Going-to-prison-was-the-best-thing-thats-ever-happened-to-me.html |title=Troy Deeney: Going to prison was the best thing that's ever happened to me |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt |date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
