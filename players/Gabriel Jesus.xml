==Early life==
Born in [[São Paulo]], Jesus grew up in the neighborhood of Jardim Peri. After initially playing street football, he joined amateur clubs in the region, his last one being Associação Atlética Anhanguera.&lt;ref name="PTD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdao.net/noticia.php?n=12383|title=PTD fala com Gabriel Fernando, destaque do sub-17|trans-title=PTD speaks with Gabriel Fernando, under-17's spotlight|website=Verdao.net|publisher=Palmeiras Todo Dia|language=pt|accessdate=23 February 2016|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/2015/01/joia-2015-famoso-na-base-gabriel-jesus-e-fenomeno-do-palmeiras.html|title=Famoso na base, Gabriel Jesus é "fenômeno" do Palmeiras|trans-title=Famous at the youth setup, Jesus is Palmeiras' "phenomenon"|publisher=[[Globo Esporte]]|language=pt|date=1 January 2015|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Palmeiras===
On 1 July 2013, Jesus signed a youth contract with [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]].&lt;ref name="PTD"/&gt; He was also the club's top goalscorer during the year, scoring 54 goals in 48 matches.

In January 2014, after lengthy negotiations, Jesus signed a three-year contract for Palmeiras with an additional two, with his salary to increase from [[Brazilian real|R$]]15,000 to four times as much in the fifth year; the fee to buy him out from his contract increased tenfold to R$30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmeiras.com.br/noticias/ler/34888-artilheiro-do-paulista-sub-17-atacante-gabriel-jesus-renova-com-o-palmeiras|title=Artilheiro do Paulista Sub-17, atacante Gabriel Jesus renova com o Palmeiras|trans-title=Paulista under-17's top scorer, forward Gabriel Jesus renews with Palmeiras|publisher=Palmeiras' official website|language=pt|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deal changed the balance of his economic rights from 75–25% in favour of Palmeiras, to 70–30% in favour of his agents.&lt;ref name=estadao&gt;{{cite news|last1=Batista|first1=Gabriel|title=Gabriel Jesus luta para superar a timidez e lidar com fama no Palmeiras|trans-title=Gabriel Jesus fought to overcome shyness and lead Palmeiras to glory|url=http://esportes.estadao.com.br/noticias/futebol,desafio-de-gabriel-jesus-e-se-acostumar-com-os-holofotes-no-palmeiras,1751885|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=Estadão|date=28 August 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus scored 37 goals in 22 games for Palmeiras in the 2014 edition of the state under-17 championship, leading to offers from clubs throughout the country and abroad.&lt;ref name="PTD"/&gt; He was first included in Palmeiras' squad for a senior match on 27 August 2014, remaining an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] as they lost 0–1 at home to [[Clube Atlético Mineiro]] in the [[2014 Copa do Brasil knockout stages|first leg of the last 16]] of [[2014 Copa do Brasil|the year]]'s [[Copa do Brasil]]. He did not make any senior appearances during the campaign, as his side was seriously threatened with relegation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esporteinterativo.com.br/futebol-brasileiro/joia-do-palmeiras-gabriel-jesus-acredita-ser-muito-cedo-para-jogar-no-elenco-profissional/|title=Joia do Palmeiras, Jesus acredita ser muito cedo para jogar no elenco profissional|trans-title=Palmeiras' pearl, Jesus thinks it is too soon to play in the main squad|publisher=[[Esporte Interativo]]|language=pt|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this decision, took by managers [[Ricardo Gareca]] and [[Dorival Júnior]], was widely criticized by the supporters, who demanded a change for the youngster through a [[petition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/palmeiras/noticia/2014/12/em-jogo-do-ano-torcedor-faz-abaixo-assinado-e-exige-escalacao-de-joia.html|title=Em jogo do ano, torcedor faz abaixo-assinado e "exige" escalação de Joia|trans-title=In game of the year, supporters create petition and "demand" pearl in the line-up|publisher=Globo Esporte|language=pt|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus made his senior debut on 7 March 2015 in the season's [[Campeonato Paulista]], replacing [[Leandro Pereira]] in the 73rd minute of a 1–0 win over [[CA Bragantino]] at [[Allianz Parque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gabriel Jesus estreia, e Palmeiras vence 6ª seguida|trans-title=Gabriel Jesus debuts, and Palmeiras win for the 6th consecutive time|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/estaduais/campeonato-paulista/gabriel-jesus-estreia-e-palmeiras-vence-6-seguida,629a4135166fb410VgnVCM10000098cceb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=Terra|date=7 March 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He totalled eight appearances, all off the bench, as the ''Verdão'' lost on a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] in [[2015 Campeonato Paulista|the final]] against [[Santos FC|Santos]].
