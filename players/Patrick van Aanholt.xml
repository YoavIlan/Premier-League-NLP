Van Aanholt joined [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s youth ranks in 2007, making his professional debut while on loan at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 9 August 2009 in a 2–1 [[Football League Championship]] win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8187233.stm | title=Coventry 2–1 Ipswich | publisher=BBC Sport | date=9 August 2009 | accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later recalled to Chelsea in December due to the exit of many players due to the [[African Nations Cup]].

Van Aanholt was first selected for Chelsea in an [[FA Cup]] tie away to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the [[FA Cup 2009–10|2009–10]] edition of the Cup, wearing the squad number 52, but did not make an appearance, remaining on the bench.

He provided cover for the Spaniard, sustaining Newcastle's productive left flank alongside [[Jonás Gutiérrez]]. Van Aanholt played his last game in the 1–2 away victory at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].
