Then only 19, he impressed enough in the [[Eredivisie]] to earn a call up to the Nigerian national team.

Now a regular international, Omeruo has represented Nigeria at the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2013 Confederations Cup]] in Brazil. Omeruo cemented a place in the starting line-up at the Africa Cup of Nations as it turned into a wonderful tournament for the Super Eagles and they emerged from the tournament victorious.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25204040|title=Is Nigeria's Kenneth Omeruo Chelsea's best kept secret?|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=6 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Omeruo had spells at [[Sunshine Stars F.C.|Sunshine Stars]] and [[Anderlecht (football club)|Anderlecht]] as a trialist before he was signed from the Anderlecht academy by [[Standard Liège]].&lt;ref name="FourFourTwo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/talentspotter-meet-kenneth-omeruo-best-chelsea-player-youve-never-heard?|title=Meet Kenneth Omeruo, the best Chelsea player you've never heard of|date=6 January 2014|accessdate=6 January 2014|publisher=FourFourTwo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2012, Omeruo scored against [[VVV-Venlo]] in the 19th minute, although just three minutes later scored an own goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2012/04/28/netherlands/eredivisie/vvv-venlo/hfc-ado-den-haag/1120594/ |title=VVV-Venlo v.s.

====Loan to Kasımpaşa====
On 21 July 2015, Omeruo joined [[Kasımpaşa Spor Kulübü|Kasımpaşa]] on a season-long loan with an option to purchase the player at the end of the spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Omeruo Kasımpaşamızda |url=http://www.kasimpasaspor.org.tr/haberler/haber/1010555-omeruo-kasimpasamizda |publisher=Kasımpaşa |date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August 2015, Omeruo made his debut for Kasımpaşa in a match against [[Gaziantepspor]], the match ended in a 3–0 victory for Kasımpaşa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Gaziantepspor vs. Kasımpaşa  0 - 3 |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/16/turkey/super-lig/gaziantepspor/kasimpasa-sk/2074329/ |publisher=Soccerway |date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later,  Omeruo made his home debut against [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.]] which ended in a 1–0 victory for Kasımpaşa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Kasımpaşa vs. İstanbul Başakşehir  1 - 0 |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2015/08/21/turkey/super-lig/kasimpasa-sk/istanbul-buyuksehir-bsk/2074340/ |publisher=Soccerway |date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omeruo had an up and down season, suffering from a couple injuries, however started whenever he was fit. Although the loan deal had an option to buy, Kasımpaşa decided to pass on the option due to a lack of funds, which led to Omeruo returning to Chelsea for pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Kenneth Omeruo To Return To Chelsea For Pre-Season Training |url=http://www.allnigeriasoccer.com/read_news.php?nid=19196/ |publisher=AllNigeriaSoccer |date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
