}}
'''Heurelho da Silva Gomes''' (born 15 February 1981), better known as '''Heurelho Gomes''', is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He previously made a name for himself at Dutch club [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], and also spent six years at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

==Club career==

===Cruzeiro===
Gomes began as a [[forward (association football)|forward]], only becoming a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at age 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Bate|title=Alisson, Ederson, and the rising reputation of Brazilian 'keepers|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=3 October 2018|work=Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11513746/alisson-ederson-and-the-rising-reputation-of-brazilian-keepers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes started his career in his native country Brazil at [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], where he played 59 games between 2001 and 2004. Here, he was scouted by [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]] and in July 2004, he was sold to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].

===PSV===
Gomes made his debut for the [[Eindhoven]] club against Serbian side [[Red Star Belgrade]] on 11 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Meesterscout Piet de Visser |url=http://sargasso.nl/archief/2008/02/08/meesterscout-piet-de-visser/ |publisher=Sargasso |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008 | language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, there were critics, saying that Brazilians "should be on the field, not in the goal". In other words, there were doubts if Gomes was reliable enough. Those doubts were quickly erased. Even though he conceded two goals in his debut against [[RBC Roosendaal|RBC]], which PSV won 5–2, he proved himself to be a reliable goalkeeper. He played a major part in PSV's four latest consecutive titles in the Eredivisie and in the great European achievements. In his first season, PSV immediately reached the semi-finals of the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], where in the 14 attempts before, PSV wasn't able to reach the second round. In the following seasons, PSV progressed each time from the group stage.

In the [[Eredivisie]], Gomes was known for his outstanding reflexes, which saved points for PSV more than once. Also his trademark throwing ability is well known. Gomes is able to throw the ball all the way deep into the opponents half. Also before the start of the match and second half, Gomes jumps up above the goal with his shoulders, pumping up the PSV supporters.

Gomes was a crowd favorite at PSV. He can speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and while in the Netherlands, he picked up a fair amount of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], although it has to be said he is not fluent in the language.

Even though the rivalry between PSV, [[Feyenoord]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] is intense, fans from rival clubs showed sympathy for the Brazilian.

Notable was an incident in [[Rotterdam]] in the match against Feyenoord, when Gomes injured himself whilst celebrating a goal, scored by his teammate [[Phillip Cocu]]. However, he managed to continue and even managed to pull off a wonder save, keeping his side in the game, which they went on to draw.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Following the appointment of manager [[Juande Ramos]], Gomes signed for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 27 June 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gomes deal agreed|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesdealagreed260608.html|work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=27 June 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a fee was believed to be around £7.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham pay £7m for Brazil goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article4222568.ece|work=Times.|publisher=www.times online.co.uk|date=27 June 2008|accessdate=14 February 2010| location=London| first=Gary| last=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes played his first game in Tottenham colours in a pre-season [[exhibition game|friendly match]] on 19 July 2008 against Spanish [[Segunda División B]] side [[CD Dénia|Dénia]], which Tottenham won 4–2.

Gomes eventually obtained a [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit]] to play in the United Kingdom, despite playing less than the 75% required number of games for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the last two years. Gomes made his home debut on 10 August 2008, keeping a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] with a 5–0 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on Tottenham's last pre-season friendly, before the [[2008–09 Premier League]] began.

Tottenham lost their two opening games 2–1 to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] respectively, but his presence in goal helped Spurs earn their first point of the season with a draw against [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. His reputation took a hit a week later, however, when he conceded a weak shot from [[Ashley Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7601910.stm|title=Tottenham 1–2 Aston Villa|author=Chris Whyatt|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Spurs' 2–1 home defeat against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. These blunders continued as he conceded an [[own goal]] in a [[London derbies|London derby]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 15 November 2008, which kept his club mired deep in the relegation zone and also caused Spurs goalkeeping coach [[Hans Leitert]] to be sacked on 19 November 2008, with the appointment of former Spurs goalkeeper [[Tony Parks]] made shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7737001.stm|title=Spurs goalkeeping coach departs|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes went on to put in a strong performance against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], saving two shots deep into the match in which Tottenham won 2–0, before making two important saves to deny [[Park Ji-sung]] and [[Ryan Giggs]] in a 0–0 draw with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gomes was injured in Spurs' 5–1 win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the second game of the [[2009–10 Premier League]] season and had to be replaced by second-choice goalkeeper [[Carlo Cudicini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8202440.stm |title=Hull 1 – 5 Tottenham |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|work=BBC Sport  |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2009|author=Sam Lyon }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an [[MRI]] scan, it was revealed that Gomes suffered damage to his groin which would keep him out for up to a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesupdate200809.html |title=Gomes update. |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made his return to first team action in the 5–1 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 23 September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/peterthegreat230909.html |title=Peter the great! |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made his Premier League comeback in the 2–1 win at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 17 October. During this match, the Brazilian made a handful of brilliant saves, one of which was compared by former Spurs goalkeeper [[Pat Jennings]] to a famous save made by [[Gordon Banks]] against Brazil in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/gomesmiraclesavepat211009.html |title=Gomes' 'miracle save' – Pat. |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|publisher=tottenhamhotspur.com |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurent Koscielny-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Gomes (in green) clashing with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] defender [[Laurent Koscielny]] in a [[North London derby]] in November 2010]]
On 3 April 2010, he made two [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] saves out of three against in a 3–1 defeat away at Sunderland, then on 14 April, Gomes' fine form aided Spurs in picking up their first Premier League victory over Arsenal in 21 meetings; he saved a [[Robin van Persie]] free kick and several other attempts on goal in succession. The following week, on 17 April, Gomes again made several crucial saves as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2–1 as the team passed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to sit fourth in the League standings. He kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanders]] and then played a vital role in the 1–0 victory against Manchester City with two crucial saves which saw Tottenham get into the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time ever.

On 20 October 2010, Gomes received a [[ejection (sports)|red card]] for fouling [[Jonathan Biabiany]] within the first ten minutes of the first half against European Champions [[Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League]]. Tottenham Hotspur lost the match 4–3 after going 4–0 down inside the first 35 minutes, despite a second half [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] from [[Gareth Bale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Inter Milan 4 Tottenham 3|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/9102192.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=20 October 2010|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes' goalkeeping ability was called into question on 13 April 2011 in the second leg tie against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] after a long-shot from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] slipped out of Gomes' hands over his head and into the goal to put Real Madrid 5–0 up on aggregate. Gomes took blame for another controversial goal against Chelsea on 30 April after a shot from [[Frank Lampard]] slipped between his legs and although Gomes scrambled back and appeared to clear the ball, the goal was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9469237.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chelsea 2–1 Tottenham | date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurs went on to lose the game 2–1.

After several high-profile errors and misjudgements by Gomes, Tottenham signed 40-year-old keeper [[Brad Friedel]] on a [[free transfer (association football)|free transfer]] from Aston Villa to provide competition in the first team. Friedel began the season as the starter with Gomes being relegated to the bench and later being left out of match day squads entirely, which led to immediate speculation regarding his future at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry ready to let Gomes go|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,,11675_7171541,00.html|publisher=SkySports.com|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomes played his first match of the [[2011–12 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2011–12 season]] in a [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 6–7 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] after [[Massimo Luongo]] missed a penalty. Subsequently, Gomes played in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]], keeping a clean sheet in the 1–0 victory over [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]]. Following Spurs' deadline day capture of goalkeeper [[Hugo Lloris]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], Gomes slipped to fourth-choice at Spurs, but following the sale of Carlo Cudicini to the [[LA Galaxy]], he rose back to third-choice, behind Lloris and Friedel.

====Loan to 1899 Hoffenheim====
On the final day of the January 2013 transfer window, Gomes agreed to join German [[Bundesliga]] side [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]] on loan until the end of [[2012–13 Bundesliga|the season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21275694 |title=Heurelho Gomes: Tottenham loan goalkeeper to Hoffenheim |work=BBC |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February, he made his debut as Hoffenheim won 2–1 against [[SC Freiburg]]. After the match, manager [[Marco Kurz]] praised Gomes, saying, "Gomes has shown a very solid performance. Although he has only trained once with us, his aura was strong." Throughout the match, Gomes made four crucial saves and looked assured in claiming six crosses, commanding his penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heurelho Gomes causes a stir on Hoffenheim debut|url=http://hereisthecity.com/2013/02/04/heurelho-gomes-causes-a-stir-on-hoffenheim-debut/|publisher=Here is the City|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his third match for Hoffenheim, he was already [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing the team, although his season ended prematurely when, on 6 April 2013, he broke his [[metacarpus]] during an important 3–0 home win over [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]]. He had to undergo hand surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.achtzehn99.de/saisonende-fuer-heurelho-gomes/ |language = German | title=Saisonende für Heurelho Gomes|publisher=achtzehn99.de|date=6 April 2013|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Tottenham====
After his injury, Gomes returned to Tottenham and started the [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2013–14 season]] with Spurs. Gomes' role remained as third-choice, however, as the backup to Brad Friedel and the club number one Hugo Lloris. On 22 May 2014, Tottenham announced that Gomes would leave the club the following month when his contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heurelho Gomes to depart Tottenham |url=http://www.espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1829876/heurelho-gomes-depart-tottenham?cc=5901 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heurelho Gomes 150314 Watford v Reading-92.jpg|thumbnail|Gomes warming-up for Watford.]]

===Watford===
Gomes signed a one-year deal, with an option of a second, at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 24 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140524-heurelho-gomes-signs-for-watford-1571831.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524101933/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140524-heurelho-gomes-signs-for-watford-1571831.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season with the Championship club Gomes played in 44 games helping the club gain [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League.

Following the Hornets' promotion to the Premier League, Gomes signed a new three-year contract with the club on 20 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/150520-heurelho-gomes-new-watford-fc-contract-2463252.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520162420/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/150520-heurelho-gomes-new-watford-fc-contract-2463252.aspx |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Player of the Season award at the end of the 2015/16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/heurelho-gomes |title=Heurelho Gomes Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Heurelho Gomes.jpg|thumb|upright|Gomes in an international [[exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 2006.]]
Gomes made his debut for Brazil in the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. Although the competition is for senior national teams, Brazil chose to send an under-23 squad to the competition. Gomes made five appearances as Brazil went to the final and finished second after being beaten by [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 1–0.

Despite being part of the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup squads#Brazil|Brazilian squad]] that won the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as the third-choice keeper behind [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] and [[Marcos Roberto Silveira Reis|Marcos]], Gomes did not receive any playing time. He was also excluded from then coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]]'s final [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|23-man roster]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany.

It was not until his inclusion in the team for a series of late-summer friendlies, as a consequence of new Brazil coach [[Dunga]]'s desire to play many of the ''Seleção's'' younger stars, that Gomes has finally gained some consistent playing time in goal. On 14 August 2006, he was called up for a friendly against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], which ended in a 1–1 draw. On 3 September 2006, he played in Brazil's 3–0 win over rivals [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[Emirates Stadium]] in England. Two days later, Gomes kept a second consecutive clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[White Hart Lane]]. His latest stint between the sticks was during a 2–1 win over [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] on 10 October 2006.

On 11 May 2010, it was announced that Gomes would be part of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|Brazilian squad]] which would compete at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in South Africa, alongside [[Júlio César (football goalkeeper, born 1979)|Júlio César]] and [[Doni (footballer)|Doni]]. Gomes made a rare appearance for Brazil in a World Cup warm-up game, replacing Brazil's number one keeper Júlio César as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2010/0602/1224271732343.html?
