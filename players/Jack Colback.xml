'''Jack Raymond Colback''' (born 24 October 1989) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]] for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

Colback began his career at [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2008, having graduated from [[Sunderland A.F.C. Reserves and Academy|their academy]], and broke into the team following loans at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. After 115 [[Premier League]] appearances with Sunderland, his contract expired and he controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United.   However, as of 11 August 2017, his future with Newcastle United is now in doubt after he was dropped from the 25-strong Premiership squad for the 2017–2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4782786/Newcastle-s-Jack-Colback-set-leave-training-row.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He played once for England at [[England national under-20 football team|Under-20 level]] in 2009, and was called up for the [[England national football team|senior squad]] for the first time in August 2014.

====Early career and loans====
[[File:Jack Colback cropped.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Colback in the match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the final day of the [[2011–12 Premier League]] season.]]
Colback was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Tyne and Wear]]&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; and joined the Sunderland academy at the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Jack Colback"&gt;{{cite web| title = Jack Colback| url = http://www.safc.com/page/ReserveSquadProfiles/0,,10281~1707908,00.html| publisher = Sunderland A.F.C| accessdate = 9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2008, Colback signed his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland tie up academy deals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7428057.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 May 2008|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After manager [[Steve Bruce]] announced his intention to loan out Colback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce loans out starlets|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/5472375/bruce-loans-out-starlets|publisher=Sky Sports|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on [[loan (association football)|loan]] on 6 August 2009 on a deal that would expire in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Ipswich sign Sunderland's Colback"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich sign Sunderland's Colback| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/8187193.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 6 August 2009| accessdate = 19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Ipswich in a 3–3 draw with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] after [[extra time]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], which was won 4–2 in a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name="Shrewsbury   3 - 3   Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = Shrewsbury   3&amp;nbsp;– 3   Ipswich| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8188438.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 13 August 2009| accessdate = 19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[The Football League|Football League]] debut came in a 2–0 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] after being introduced as a 46th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]].&lt;ref name="West Brom   2 - 0   Ipswich"&gt;{{cite news| title = West Brom   2&amp;nbsp;– 0   Ipswich| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8202374.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 22 August 2009| accessdate = 22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for Ipswich against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and scored against them again later on in the season in the [[FA Cup]]. His form meant the loan was extended until the end of the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]] season in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Ipswich Town extend loan for Sunderland's Jack Colback"&gt;{{cite news| title = Ipswich Town extend loan for Sunderland's Jack Colback| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/8448221.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 8 January 2010| accessdate = 9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted Ipswich's Players' Player of the Season 2009–10.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/21042010/63/colback-earns-plaudits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Sunderland from a loan spell at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the end of the 2009–10 Championship season and made his [[Premier League]] debut as a 76th-minute substitute against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He was later sent off for two bookable offences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10281~47536,00.html |title=Match Report: Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 – 1 Sunderland |publisher=Sunderland A.F.C. |accessdate=26 July 2014 |date=9 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512200954/http://www.safc.com/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10281~47536%2C00.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his debut lasting just nine minutes. He made his home debut against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 24 August 2010 as a substitute. Colback went out on loan for a second spell at Ipswich, confirmed on 15 October and which lasted until 6 January when he returned to Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback seals Ipswich return|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/6446517/colback-seals-ipswich-return|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback returns to Black Cats|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11688/6638893/colback-returns-to-black-cats|publisher=Sky Sports|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakthrough====
Following his second loan spell at Ipswich, Colback returned to Sunderland in January 2011, and his appearances became more frequent. Colback started for Sunderland in their [[FA Cup]] 3rd Round defeat to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 8 January. He then came off the bench as Sunderland drew 1–1 against local rivals and the team Colback supported as a child, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], on 16 January. He also appeared as a second-half substitute as Sunderland drew 0–0 with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 5 March. Colback made his first Premier League start for Sunderland in their 2–0 defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colback’s keen to prove his class after full debut|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/8987692.Colback___s_keen_to_prove_his_class_after_full_debut/|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback also started the following week as Sunderland beat [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 4–1. Colback had arguably his best performance in a Sunderland shirt in their 2–1 win at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] on 7 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/09/bolton-wanderers-sunderland-premier-league | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Jolly | title=Boudewijn Zenden shows his staying power to give Sunderland hope | date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback demonstrated his versatility by being deployed at left back in the final game of the season at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland stroll to a top-ten finish at last|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/football/sunderland/9041857.West_Ham_United_0_Sunderland_3/|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colback started the first game of the 2011–12 season, as Sunderland drew with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield, Liverpool|Anfield]]. Sunderland drew 1–1 with Colback playing alongside [[Lee Cattermole]] in central midfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0815/1224302451634.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Andy | last=Hunter | title=Liverpool need a few more like Suarez | date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 2011, Colback scored his first goal for the club, a deflected effort, in 1–1 draw with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/16240466.stm | title=Sunderland   1&amp;nbsp;– 1   Everton | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=BBC Sport | date=26 December 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback was deployed at left back on New Year's Day 2012 against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and helped Sunderland to a surprise victory against the Premier League leaders. He again played at left back in Sunderland's 4–2 win at Wigan two days later, where he sustained a knee injury which ruled him out for a few weeks. On 5 January 2012, he signed a 2-year contract extension which expired in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16433256.stm "Jack Colback signs contract extension"] BBC Sport. 5 January 2012. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Colback returned from injury as a substitute in Sunderland's 1–1 FA Cup draw with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], and returned to the starting line up in central midfield as the Black Cats beat Norwich 3–0 on 1 February. He scored his second goal for Sunderland with a left footed strike in the replay against Middlesbrough at the [[Riverside Stadium]], as Sunderland won 2–1 after extra time to reach the fifth round.

The 2012–13 season saw Colback play regularly at left back due to injuries to [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]], and right back in the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] as Sunderland defeated Newcastle 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Newcastle United 0 Sunderland 3|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22056537|date=14 April 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Colback is willing to play out in position, so it will help the club's solve their issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback happy to play out of position|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/8667214/premier-league-sunderland-midfielder-jack-colback-happy-to-play-out-of-position|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cardiff v Sunderland equaliser.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sunderland players celebrate Colback's last-minute equaliser against Cardiff on 28 December 2013.]]
Following Rose's return to Tottenham, Colback began the 2013–14 season as Sunderland's first choice at left back, before being moved back into central midfield by [[Gus Poyet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Jack Colback happy to be back in Sunderland's midfield|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/8997626/premier-league-jack-colback-happy-to-be-back-in-sunderlands-midfield|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December Colback scored a last minute goal in the fifth minute of injury time to salvage a 2–2 draw at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colback late show rocks Cardiff|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/367315/report.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5739|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colback made his 100th Premier League appearance on 1 January 2014 in a 1–0 home defeat to Aston Villa. He scored his second goal of the season on 1 February 2014, scoring the third goal in a 3–0 away win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newcastle 0–3 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25892175|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his third goal of the season on 7 May 2014, scoring the first goal in a 2–0 home win to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], to retain Sunderland's top division safety and relegating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to the Football League Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunderland 2 – 0 West Bromwich Albion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26300993|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his contract about to expire at the end of the 2013–14 season, then-manager [[Paolo Di Canio]] urged to Colback to make a decision on his future at Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio calls on Jack Colback to decide over his Sunderland future|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/8849634/paolo-di-canio-calls-on-jack-colback-to-decide-over-his-sunderland-future|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Colback confirmed that talks of a new deal had started after initially rejecting a new contract in the summer under the management of Di Canio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Midfielder Jack Colback in talks over a new contract at Sunderland|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9003798/midfielder-jack-colback-in-talks-over-a-new-contract-at-sunderland|publisher=Sky Sports|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further talks over a new contract continued in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League: Sunderland discussing new deal with Jack Colback|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9156200/premier-league-sunderland-discussing-new-deal-with-jack-colback|publisher=Sky Sports|date=8 February 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, it was reported that Colback had turned down a new contract with the club and was set to depart upon the expiry of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Jack Colback and Phil Bardsley set to leave Sunderland this summer|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9260526/transfer-news-jack-colback-and-phil-bardsley-set-to-leave-sunderland-this-summer|publisher=Sky Sports|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Premier League clubs made contract offers to sign Colback, but Sunderland refused to give up on Colback and hoped he would stay at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Battle for Sunderland's Jack Colback is hotting up|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9269358/transfer-news-battle-for-sunderlands-jack-colback-is-hotting-up|publisher=Sky Sports|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer news: Sunderland still hoping Jack Colback and Phil Bardsley could yet stay|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/9296561/transfer-news-sunderland-still-hoping-jack-colback-and-phil-bardsley-could-yet-stay|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 May 2014|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Colback joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Colback and Adlene Guedioura make it SEVEN January additions for Nottingham Forest|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/jack-colback-adlene-guedioura-make-1148493|publisher=Nottingham Post|accessdate=9 February 2018|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having joined Forest, he accused Benítez of disrespecting him during his stint at the club and said that he was "treated more like a number than a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newcastle news: Jack Colback lashes out at Rafa Benitez after Nottingham loan move|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/914424/Newcastle-transfer-news-Jack-Colback-Rafa-Benitez-Nottingham-Forest-transfer-news|publisher=Express|accessdate=9 February 2018|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2018, Colback returned to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on a season-long loan with the option to make it permanent at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2018/july/reds-clinch-colback-return/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Colback has received one cap for the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20 team]], he played in a 2–0 friendly win against [[Italy national under-20 football team|Italy]] at Loftus Road in March 2009. He replaced [[Marc Albrighton]] in the 79th minute as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIONS' LOFTUS ROAR|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u20s/News/2009/italy_310309_report|publisher=TheFA.com|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2014, Colback received his first call-up to the [[England national football team|senior team]] for the matches against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy calls up four new faces for Norway and Switzerland|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2014/aug/norway-switzerland-squad-announcement-rose-colback-delph-chambers|publisher=[[The FA]]|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had to withdraw from the squad with a calf injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colback ruled out for England|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/243/545/0/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Colback out of England squad with calf injury|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29056963|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
A former left-back, Colback is a left-footed central midfielder known for his versatility and efficient playing style; due to his technical skills, passing range and physique, he is neat in possession and rarely gives the ball away, which along with his athletic ability and defensive work-rate, allows him to link-up the defence and the attack effectively. Former England manager [[Roy Hodgson]] has likened his abilities to those of [[Andrea Pirlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/28/roy-hodgson-jack-colback-england-newcastle-alan-pardew|title=Roy Hodgson’s ‘Ginger Pirlo’ Jack Colback tipped to make England impact|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Louise Taylor|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/11062428/Mocking-Jack-Colbacks-England-call-up-is-nothing-but-ignorance-and-stupidity-from-armchair-fans.html|title=Mocking Jack Colback's England call-up is nothing but ignorance and stupidity from armchair fans|publisher=The Telegraph|author1=Luke Edwards|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
