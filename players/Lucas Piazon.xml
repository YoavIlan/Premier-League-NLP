'''Lucas Domingues Piazon''' (born 20 January 1994) is a Brazilian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]], on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He is primarily a [[Forward (association football)|striker]], although he has also been deployed as a left [[Winger (association football)#Winger|winger]], as an [[attacking midfielder]] or in the hole behind the striker.

==Early life==
Piazon was born in [[São Paulo]], to António Carlos Piazon, a commercial representative, and Marizabel Domingues, a lawyer. He had a financially secure upbringing that allowed him to focus on both school and football at the same time. Both of Piazon's parents took an active role in his career. He grew up with his sister Juliana, who is three years younger than him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseaindia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=781&amp;start=0|title=Piazon sister|publisher=ChelseaIndia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116080351/http://www.chelseaindia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=781&amp;start=0|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] supporter from an early age, aspiring to play for them some day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pitacodogringo.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/interview-with-chelsea-signing-lucas-piazon-full-version/|title=Piazon Biography|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|publisher=pitacodogringo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/boy-from-brazil-set-for-life-at-chelsea-2672129.html|title=Brazilian to Stamford Bridge|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was young, Piazon's family moved to [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Piazon's football skills began to blossom at age eight. He developed an interest in [[futsal]] (indoor football) like other Brazilian footballers (such as [[Zico]] and [[Ronaldinho]]). He began playing for [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]]. At the age of 11, Piazon made the switch from [[Indoor soccer|indoor]] to the field.

==Club career==

===Youth career===
Piazon began his professional career with [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]]. He made an impression with them becoming top scorer in every youth tournament he appeared in. In 2007, he moved to neighbouring club, [[Clube Atlético Paranaense|Atlético Paranaense]]. He again turned out, as Atlético reached the finals of the U-15 Copa do Brasil in 2008, which they eventually lost to [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]. São Paulo became very impressed with his performance and made an offer. At the age of 14, Piazon left his family behind in Curitiba and joined São Paulo. In May, he began to attract the attention of international scouts when he helped guide São Paulo through the Brazilian qualifiers for the [[Manchester United Premier Cup|Premier Cup]] (Nike Cup). It was around this time that he was also called up by Brazil's U-15s. In August, São Paulo travelled to Manchester for the Premier Cup finals. In the Group stage, Piazon scored in the 3–0 win versus [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. São Paulo then went on to beat [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the final match.

===Chelsea===
In early 2011, Chelsea secured the services of Piazon by means of a pre-contract, having to fight off the interest from a number of the world's leading clubs, including Italian team [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/8568660/Brazils-best-young-footballers-no-long-available-on-the-cheap.html|title=Brazil's best young footballers no longer available on the cheap|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=8 July 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Jon|last=Cotterill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2011, São Paulo announced that Piazon could only play for the Chelsea senior team after 20 January 2012 when he became eligible to obtain a work visa, but he would join in the 2011 summer transfer window. Chelsea announced ten days later with Piazon passing a medical in London in early March 2011. It was reported that Chelsea paid in the region of [[Pound sterling|£]]5&amp;nbsp;million to acquire Piazon, which could rise to £10&amp;nbsp;million depending on several clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/15/chelsea-brazilian-teenager-lucas-piazon

I think my way of playing and my skills are more suited to the Premier League."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-starlet-im-not-kaka |title=Chelsea teenager Lucas Piazon rejects Kaka comparisons |publisher=Give Me Football |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piazon made his debut for the reserve team against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], thereafter saying, "I am able to play in the Youth Cup now." "Everybody knows I am here to play, so my main aims for the season are to play as many youth games as possible and hopefully feature in the reserves as well, and I want to win the Youth Cup." He also stated, "I am enjoying the company of [[Ramires]], [[Alex (footballer, born 1982)|Alex]] and, of course, [[David Luiz]] is my best friend here. He is so funny and always joking so it's nice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2514375 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625123649/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2514375 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2014 |title=Youth Report: Chelsea 4 Fulham 2 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piazon scored his first reserve goal in an away victory against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], just before full-time with a solo effort, inside the box before firing it into the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2552711 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625123644/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2552711 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 June 2014 |title=RESERVE REPORT: ARSENAL 0 CHELSEA 4 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has scored twice in five games for the reserves and once in six for the youth team, most notably the winner in the [[FA Youth Cup]] tie against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-sign-up-brazilian-starlet |title=Chelsea sign up Brazilian starlet |publisher=Give Me Football |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He won the FA Youth Cup on 9 May 2012 against Blackburn, although failing to score in the match.

On 20 January 2012, his 18th birthday, Piazon obtained a [[work visa]] and became eligible to play for the Chelsea senior team. On 26 January 2012, he signed a contract extension that will keep him with the club until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2589434 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130425105748/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2589434 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 April 2013 |title=Piazon Signs Extension |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After impressing at Under-18 and Reserve level, Piazon was given the number 35 shirt, which was previously worn by [[Juliano Belletti]]. He was an unused substitute on the Chelsea bench, on 31 January 2012, in their 1–1 league draw against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/16695854.stm |title=Piazon makes bench |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 5 February 2012, in the 3–3 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16779082 |title=Chelsea v Man U |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Chelsea manager [[André Villas-Boas]] said, after the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] game, "He [Piazon] has trained more with the first team, which is very good for him. He's made great progress since arriving and in the last two games was on the bench. Unfortunately, he had no opportunity to enter, but has done a great job in the reserves team. He is a player that we have high hopes for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/avb-chelsea-have-high-hopes-lucas-piazon-2687411 |title=AVB: Chelsea have high hopes for Lucas Piazon |publisher= Tribal Football |accessdate= 2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2012, Piazon was named Chelsea Young Player of the Year in his first season. He was part of the side that won the FA Youth Cup Final 24 hours earlier. "I am very happy and I didn't expect this. It has been a fantastic week for me. David Luiz and Ramires have helped me a lot here as when I came in I was alone. I hope to be at Chelsea a long time and I will keep working." he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2767955 |location=London |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |title=Piazon pick up Chelsea award |date=25 June 2014 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, he was named on the bench on the final day of the season, in a home game against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] which Chelsea won 2–1, but was not involved in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17973169 "Chelsea 2–1 Blackburn"] BBC Sport. 13 May 2012. Retrieved 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He told that he's looking forward to continuing his development and would like to make the breakthrough into the senior side, saying "I hope to be in the main group, train with them every day and if I have a chance to play some games." He went on to say that he's "always dreamed of playing for Chelsea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7884927/|title=Piazon living Chelsea dream|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012|publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012–13 season====
The pre-season prior to the start of the [[2012–13 Chelsea F.C. season|2012–13 season]], Piazon was given a chance to prove himself by Chelsea manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]] after being taken on tour in the United States, came on as a substitute in three of the four matches, making his senior debut in the 4–2 win over [[Seattle Sounders FC|Seattle Sounders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2853452/title/match-report-seattle-sounders-2-chelsea-4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119114156/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2853452/title/match-report-seattle-sounders-2-chelsea-4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=MATCH REPORT: SEATTLE SOUNDERS 2 CHELSEA 4 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in his second senior Chelsea appearance, the equaliser to earn Chelsea a 1–1 draw against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] at [[Yankee Stadium]].

====Loan to Chievo====

In January 2019, he joined on loan [[A.C. ChievoVerona|ChievoVerona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chievoverona.it/en/highlights/news/official-lucas-piazon-giallobl%C3%B9|title=OFFICIAL: LUCAS PIAZON IS GIALLOBLÙ|publisher=A.C. ChievoVerona|date=31 January 2019|accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Piazon has represented Brazil at both under-15 and under-17 levels. At under-15 level, he helped his team to second place in the [[South American Under-15 Football Championship]] of [[2009 South American Under-15 Football Championship|2009]] in Bolivia, being the top goalscorer with ten goals.

At the under-17 level, during an international game for Brazil's U17 squad against Paraguay, Piazon scored an extraordinary goal when he kicked the ball with such force that it broke through the side netting of the goals, in a game which they went on to lose 2–1. In the [[2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup]], he scored in a 3–3 draw against the [[Ivory Coast national under-17 football team|Ivory Coast]].

==Style of play==
A tactical player, Piazon is known for his [[Dribbling|flair]], [[Passing (association football)|passing]], [[Shooting (association football)|powerful shooting]], [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]], [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s, reading of the game and [[Association football positions#Attacking|clinical finishing]]. Piazon commented on his playing style, "I'd say my playing style is different from typical Brazilian forwards. When you think about these, you think about dribbles and flashy moves. My football is simpler and more direct. It's more like a midfielder playing up front. I like to pass quickly. I don't hog the ball and I don't tend to run with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/8568660/Brazils-best-young-footballers-no-long-available-on-the-cheap.html |title=Piazon Style |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |location=London |first=Jon |last=Cotterill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media have often drawn comparisons between Piazon and Brazilian playmaker [[Kaká]], as the pair possess similar attributes and natural technical finesse. Piazon also somewhat resembles Kaká. However, Piazon has rejected comparisons saying: "I don't think [we are similar]", Piazon says of Kaká. "My style and his style are different because I am a [[Winger (soccer)|winger]], or a [[second striker]], and he is a [[Midfielder|central midfielder]]. He went on to say, "I don't think the comparison is because of our style. I think it is because we both played at São Paulo and maybe we can look similar on the pitch sometimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/24902_lucas_piazon___i_don_t_think_i_resemble_kaka_.html |title=Lucas Piazon: "I don't think I resemble Kaká" |publisher=Samba Foot |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/chelsea-starlet-im-not-kaka |title=Chelsea starlet: I'm not Kaka |publisher=Give Me Football |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
