'''David Wayne "Junior" Hoilett''' (born 5 June 1990) is a Canadian professional [[association football]] player who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the [[CMNT|Canadian national team]].

He signed for English club [[Blackburn Rovers]] at the age of 13, and was loaned to [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]] and [[FC St. Pauli]] in the German [[2. Bundesliga]]. He made his Rovers debut in 2009 and played three full [[Premier League]] seasons for them before a transfer to [[Queens Park Rangers]]. Hoilett spent four years at the [[Loftus Road]] club – alternately in the Premier League and [[EFL Championship|Championship]] – before moving to Cardiff on the expiration of his contract.

Hoilett made his senior international debut for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in 2015. He was part of their squad at the [[2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

==Club career==

===Blackburn Rovers Academy===
Hoilett was born in [[Brampton]], [[Ontario]], and played several sports as a child before settling on football at age 11.&lt;ref name=lancs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cryer |first1=Andy |title=Hoilett: I've made it at Blackburn Rovers the hard way |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/5046588.hoilett-ive-made-it-at-blackburn-rovers-the-hard-way/ |accessdate=22 January 2019 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he travelled the world with his club and gained attention at a tournament in Wales; he turned down [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] as he believed he had more chance of breaking into the first team at the latter.&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt; After moving to England, he attended [[St Bede's Roman Catholic High School, Blackburn|St Bede's Roman Catholic High School]] in [[Blackburn]].&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier League Under 16 Schools’ Cup for Girls’ Final |url=http://www.esfa.co.uk/news/?2015/04/28/094110/premier-league-under-16-schools-cup-for-girls-final |accessdate=22 January 2019 |publisher=English Schools Football Association |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was initially unable to earn a work permit to play in the United Kingdom, Blackburn loaned him to German clubs to help him earn one in the future.&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;

====SC Paderborn (loan)====
Hoilett made his debut for [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]] (on [[loan (sports)|loan]]) against [[Kickers Offenbach]], coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Sven Lintjens]] in a 3–2 victory on 3 February 2008, aged 17.&lt;ref name="Zwei Aussetzer in der Defensive"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate =27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoilett's first match in the starting eleven was against [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]] on 9 March 2008.&lt;ref name="Beste Torchancen vergeben"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beste Torchancen vergeben |url=http://www.scpaderborn07.de/scpaderborn07/38-Saison/3820,Beste-Torchancen-vergeben.html |language=German |publisher=SC Paderborn |date= |accessdate=27 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719083808/http://www.scpaderborn07.de/scpaderborn07/38-Saison/3820%2CBeste-Torchancen-vergeben.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett scored his only goal of his loan campaign on 18 May 2008 against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paderborn vs. Borussia M'gladbach  2 – 3|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2008/05/18/germany/2-bundesliga/sc-paderborn-07-ev/borussia-monchengladbach/470135/|publisher=SoccerWay.com|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what would be his final game for the club.

Paderborn were later relegated, ending the [[2007–08 2. Bundesliga]] season in 17th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 2007/08|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit08.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FC St. Pauli (loan)====
Hoilett was loaned to another German club in the [[2. Bundesliga]], [[FC St. Pauli]], for the [[2008–09 2. Bundesliga]] season. He made his debut for the [[Hamburg]]-based side against [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth]] on 22 August 2008. He scored six times during his loan campaign with braces against [[Alemannia Aachen]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]], as well as individual goals against [[TSV 1860 München|1860 München]] and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. His final game would come in the form of a 1–0 loss against [[Rot Weiss Ahlen]] on 3 May 2009. St. Pauli finished the season in eighth position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany 2008/09|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit09.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackburn Rovers===
In January 2009, Hoilett's home club Blackburn applied for him to receive a [[work permit]] for him to play football in England.&lt;ref name="Hoilett Fight For Work Permit"&gt;{{cite news | title = Teen ace in permit fight | first = Andy | last = Cryer | url = http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/search/4427012.Teen_ace_in_permit_fight/ | publisher = Lancashire Telegraph | date = 9 June 2009 | accessdate = 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2009, Hoilett was granted a work permit on appeal, allowing him to continue his fledgling career in England at the [[Premier League]] level with Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/2bundesliga/startseite/artikel/511053/ | title = Hoilett zurück auf der Insel | language = German | publisher = kicker.de | accessdate = 9 July 2012 | date = 6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Junior Hoilett.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hoilett before the match between Blackburn and Arsenal at Ewood Park on September 17, 2011]]

He scored his first and second goals for Blackburn since his full-time return to the club in only his third game, in a pre-season friendly against non-League club [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh Genesis]]. He also earned Rovers a penalty in that game. His first competitive goal for Rovers came in a 3–1 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 25 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett was involved in Blackburn's dramatic [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 2 December 2009. Coming on as a second half substitution, he won an extra-time penalty which [[Benni McCarthy]] converted to put Rovers 3–2 up, but then missed a golden chance late on to seal victory before [[Paulo Ferreira]] equalised in the 122nd minute. However, Hoilett converted the crucial fifth penalty to help Rovers to the 4–3 shootout win and a place in the semi-finals. He then started his first league match on 12 December 2009 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 draw at the [[KC Stadium]]. On 25 February 2010, with his contract due to expire in June 2010, Hoilett ended media speculation regarding his future at the club, by signing a new two-and-a-half year deal with Blackburn, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2012. On 9 May, he scored a header in a win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]] on the final day of the season, although the goal was later recorded as a [[Richard Dunne]] own goal. Hoilett made his first Premier League appearance of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]] on 21 August 2010 by coming on for [[Nikola Kalinić]] in the 84th minute in a 2–1 defeat at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]] against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1976874,00.html | title = Junior agrees new deal | publisher = Blackburn Rovers | date = 25 February 2010 | accessdate = 9 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329034014/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1976874,00.html | archive-date = 29 March 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in the 1–0 victory over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10303~54887,00.html |title=Junior scores 1st 2010/11 season goal vs QPR |publisher=Blackburn Rovers |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014225535/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10303~54887%2C00.html |archivedate=14 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoilett scored his first league goal on 23 January 2011 in a 2–0 home victory against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Ewood Park]], converting in the 47th minute from a Nikola Kalinić assist. On 12 February 2011, he made his 40th Premier League appearance for Blackburn when he featured against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at Ewood Park in a goalless draw, and was replaced at half-time due to a slight hamstring strain by [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]]. On 5 March, he scored his third goal of the season in a 3–2 defeat against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the 65th minute, away at [[Craven Cottage]]. He replaced by debutant [[Rubén Rochina]] on 82 minutes. His next goal came in the following game, a last gasp equaliser coming from a header against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at Ewood Park in a 2–2 draw. On 9 April 2011, he scored in the 1–1 draw versus Birmingham City at Ewood Park on half-time, but he unfortunately got injured in the 68th minute, being replaced by Australian [[Brett Emerton]].

He scored his fifth league goal of the season with an individual goal, in a 3–2 win against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at [[Molineux Stadium]] on the last day of the season. On 11 September 2011, in a game between Blackburn and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], he was involved in a collision with [[Mark Schwarzer]] which resulted a head injury for Hoilett. He was eventually stretched off and Schwarzer received a yellow card.
Hoilett scored a controversial second's goal in a match as Blackburn drew with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] 3–3 after teammate Morten Gamst Pedersen seemed to dribble the ball straight from a corner before firing in a low cross for Hoilett to head home from two yards.&lt;ref name="3 Wigan–3 Blackburn"&gt;{{cite news

In January 2012, Hoilett was named one of the 13 players to watch in 2012 by world football governing body [[FIFA]].&lt;ref name="fifa-2012-01-13"&gt;{{cite news

===Queens Park Rangers===
[[File:Chelsea 2 QPR 1 (15500879198).jpg|thumb|left|Hoilett (in white) playing against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in November 2014]]
After refusing a contract renewal with Blackburn Rovers, Hoilett joined Queens Park Rangers on 27 July 2012 for a fee decided by tribunal. He signed a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Junior joins R's revolution |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10373~2858641,00.html |publisher=QPR |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729200136/http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10373~2858641%2C00.html |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19015967|title= Junior Hoilett joins Queens Park Rangers from Blackburn Rovers | date= 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for QPR in a 3–2 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 26 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645187 |title=QPR 2–3 Reading |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2013, Hoilett set-up teammate [[Loïc Rémy]] and played a crucial part in a 2–1 win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21556942|title=Southampton 1–2 QPR |publisher= [[BBC]] |date=2 March 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of injuries and poor form meant that Hoilett had a frustrating first season at QPR, which resulted in relegation to the [[Football League Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading v QPR|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/283166/report|accessdate=10 December 2014|date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
