'''Bernard''' (''[[Bernhard]]'') is a [[West Germanic]] masculine given name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Dauzat]], ''Noms et prénoms de France'', Librairie Larousse 1980. p. 38, New completed edition by [[:fr:Marie-Thérèse Morlet|Marie-Thérèse Morlet]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is attested from at least the 9th century. West Germanic ''Bernhard'' is composed from the two elements ''bern'' "bear" and ''hard'' "brave, hardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=bernhard|title=Name Meaning and Origin|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=2013-06-16}}.
T. F. Hoad, ''English Etymology'', Oxford University Press 1993. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Its native Old English reflex was ''Beornheard'', which was replaced by the Old French form ''Bernard'' after the Norman conquest.
The name ''Bernhard'' was notably popular among [[Old Frisian]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/diekosenamender00stargoog#page/n189/mode/2up Die Kosenamen der Germanen: Eine Studie], [[:de:Franz Stark (Philologe)|Franz Stark]], 1868 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
Its wider use was popularized due to Saint [[Bernhard of Clairvaux]] (canonized 1174).
