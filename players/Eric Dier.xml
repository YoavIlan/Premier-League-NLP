'''Eric Jeremy Edgar Dier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪər}} {{respell|DIRE}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tottenham Hotspur |title=Dizzy Baseball Challenge FT Eric Dier + Daniel Murphy |date=9 February 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu7QBYK4fA8&amp;t=2s |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; born 15 January 1994) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]]. A versatile defensive player, Dier has been deployed as a [[defensive midfielder]], a [[centre back]] and a [[right back]].

Dier grew up in Portugal, where he came through the youth ranks at [[Sporting CP]], making his [[Sporting CP B|reserve]] and senior debuts in 2012 after a [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. In 2014, he moved to Tottenham Hotspur on a five-year contract for a fee of £4&amp;nbsp;million.

Despite interest from Portugal, Dier opted to represent England in international football. He made his debut for the senior team in November 2015, and was chosen for [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and the [[FIFA World Cup 2018|2018 World Cup]].

==Early and personal life==
Born in [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire, Dier moved to Portugal from England when he was seven years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dier on growing up at Sporting Lisbon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34606989 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 October 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when his mother was offered a job running the hospitality programme at [[UEFA Euro 2004]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham: Eric Dier joins Spurs from Sporting on five-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28597872 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his parents and five siblings, Dier spent a year living in the [[Algarve]] region before moving to [[Lisbon]]. In 2010, his parents returned to England while Dier remained in Portugal, living at [[Sporting C.P. Youth and Academy|Sporting CP's academy]].&lt;ref name="algarveresident"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Chris |title=Sporting youngster helps to launch new Umbro England |url=http://portugalresident.com/sporting-lisbon-youngster-helps-to-launch-new-umbro-england |publisher=Portugal Resident |accessdate=27 October 2015 |date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dier is the grandson of [[Ted Croker]], a former secretary of [[The Football Association]] (FA) and president of [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], and great-nephew of [[Peter Croker]], who both played professionally for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. His father, Jeremy, is a former professional tennis player.&lt;ref name="skysports-scout"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sky Sports Scout – Eric Dier |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/transfers/scout/0,24035,15198_6091891,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=20 January 2011 |date=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501123631/http://www.skysports.com/football/transfers/scout/0,24035,15198_6091891,00.html |archivedate=1 May 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
While playing football at the International Preparatory School in Lisbon, Dier's footballing ability was spotted by his P.E. teacher Miguel Silva, who referred him to Sporting's scouts at the age of eight.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2018}} Dier signed professional terms with Sporting in April 2010. The Portuguese club beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to his signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/36629/Sporting_beat_off_competition_to_sign_English_wonderkid.aspx |title=Sporting beat off competition to sign English wonderkid |first=Nigel |last=Brown |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411223334/http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/36629/Sporting_beat_off_competition_to_sign_English_wonderkid.aspx |archivedate=11 April 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporting also sold 50% economic rights of the player to a third-party owner, [[Quality Sports Investments|Quality Football Ireland Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/PCS31990.pdf |title=Sporting Clube de Portugal – Futebol SAD publishes the Report and Financial Statements for the 1H2010/2011 |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2011 |publisher=Sporting CP |language=Portuguese |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporting bought Dier back in February 2012 by selling 50% rights of [[Filipe Chaby]].

In January 2011, Dier agreed to join [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] until 30 June. Sporting CP's official website stated that the loan was "an opportunity for the athlete to grow in a more competitive and demanding environment".&lt;ref name="sportingcp"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric Dier emprestado |url=http://www.sporting.pt/Noticias/Futebol/Fut_Form/notfutform_futericdieremprestado_200111_70977.asp |publisher=Sporting CP |accessdate=20 January 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122202939/http://www.sporting.pt/Noticias/Futebol/Fut_Form/notfutform_futericdieremprestado_200111_70977.asp |archivedate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evertonfc&gt;{{cite web |last=Griffiths |first=Darren |title=Teenager joins academy |url=http://www.evertonfc.com//news/archive/2011/01/20/teenager-joins-academy |publisher=Everton F.C. |accessdate=21 January 2011 |date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dier represented Everton U18s ten times during his loan spell and won the 2010–11 U18 Premier League with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rea |first=Alex |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/evertons-u18-premier-league-champions-7169857 |title=Everton's U18 Premier League champions of 2010/11: where are they now? |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=25 May 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dier encountered difficulties resettling into English life, but in the summer of 2011, he extended his loan stay in the Everton academy for an additional 12 months.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/23/tottenham-eric-dier-interview |title=Tottenham's Eric Dier: Some people forget I'm essentially a foreign player &amp;#124; Football |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dier had been approached by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] to play for Portugal in the future, but could only do so once he turned 18.&lt;ref name="umbro"/&gt; He had been involved in a high-profile [[England national football team|England national team]] kit promotion for sportswear manufacturers [[Umbro]], and his appearance in the campaign prompted British newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to question why The Football Association had not contacted him with a view for playing in their youth national teams.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Alex |title=Eric Dier was called up by Umbro to star with Rooney &amp;amp; Co in this shoot.
