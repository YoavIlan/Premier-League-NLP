[[File:Greg Cunningham.JPG|thumbnail|Cunningham playing for [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester City Reserves]] in 2010]]
Born in [[Galway]], [[County Galway]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt; Cunningham began his career with Cregmore FC. In 2004, he joined [[Mervue United A.F.C.|Mervue United]] before earning a contract in the [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Academy]]. Cunningham made his [[first team]] debut for Manchester City as a 46th minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 4–2 victory over [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 24 January 2010 where he played on the left side of the City defence.&lt;ref name="Scunthorpe 2 - 4 Man City"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=Lyon|title =Scunthorpe 2 – 4 Man City|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8468696.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2010|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham made his first [[Premier League]] appearance on 11 April 2010 against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as a substitute for [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]] in the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8609889.stm|title=Man City 5 – 1 Birmingham|first=Chris|last=Bevan|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 April 2010|date=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham made his second [[Premier League]] appearance on 9 May 2010 against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] as a substitute for Johnson, just 2 minutes of the final minutes of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham 1 – 1 Man City|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8666056.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2010, Cunningham made his European debut in Europa League Qualifiers Second Leg against [[FC Politehnica Timișoara|Politehnica Timișoara]], coming on as a 54th-minute substitute for [[Nigel de Jong]] in a 2–0 win. On 22 September 2010, Cunningham made his first start for the club and played 90 minutes in a 2-1 loss against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the [[2010–11 Football League Cup|League Cup]].

====Leicester City (loan)====
On 21 October 2010, Cunningham joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on [[loan (sports)|loan]] until January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2192184,00.html |title=Foxes Sign Man City's Cunningham |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |work=lcfc.com |accessdate=21 October 2010 |date=21 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200526/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2192184%2C00.html |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2010, Cunningham made his debut for the club in a 2–0 loss against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] where he played the full 90 minutes. Cunningham became a regular left-back in the starting eleven and made 12 starts. On 1 January 2011, Cunningham fractured his [[tibia]] in a challenge with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]'s [[Liam Rosenior]]. Rosenior was sent off and Cunningham had to be substituted in a 1–0 win for Leicester and he was ruled out of action for up to four months, which ended his loan spell at Leicester City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham out for four months with broken leg|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Greg-Cunningham-months-broken-leg/story-12061039-detail/story.html|publisher=This is Leicestershire|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] say his injury was 'a complete accident' and said:

{{cquote|"To be fair, there was absolutely no intention from Liam Rosenior and it was just a very unfortunate incident. Our physio team worked immediately on the injury, comforted Greg and they were superb. However, the good start to the New Year is also a bad start for us as we have lost Greg Cunningham to a broken leg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foxes in Cunningham blow|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_reaction/0,19764,11065_3283944,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nottingham Forest (loan)====
On 25 October 2011, Cunningham joined Championship side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on loan until 31 December after an injury crisis at the club left them desperately on short defensive options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City's Greg Cunningham loaned to Nottingham Forest|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2011/October/Greg-Cunningham-loaned-to-Nottingham-Forest|publisher=Manchester City F.C.|work=mcfc.co.uk|first=Tim|last=Oscroft|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham Checks In |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2492606,00.html |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |work=nottinghamforest.co.uk |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028012357/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10308~2492606%2C00.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his move to Nottingham Forest, Cunningham says he expected to make an impact for the club and was looking forward to playing regularly for the club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham raring to go|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7265710/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nottingham Forest duo [[Lee Camp (footballer)|Lee Camp]] and [[Ishmael Miller]] agreed with Cunningham's expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forest boosted by signing|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7267521/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2011, Cunningham made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss against Hull City before being substituted early in the second-half. On 1 November 2011, Cunningham played 90 minutes in a 1–0 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Since making his debut, Cunningham became a regular in the starting eleven, playing at left back.

On 29 December, Cunningham's loan was extended until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reds Strike Deal For Greg|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2560442,00.html|date=29 December 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012|publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C.|work=nottinghamforest.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reds extend Cunningham loan|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7400900/|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|work=Sky Sports|date=29 December 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his loan was extended, manager [[Steve Cotterill]] says he would want to sign Cunningham on a permanent basis, only if the money can be found in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cunningham continues to impress|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7402458/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his loan spell ended, Cotterill praised Cunningham (among the loan signing) for helping the club pull away from the relegation zone and stay in the Championship next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cotterill praises loan impact|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7649695/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 April 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bristol City===
The following season, Cunningham told [[BBC Sport]] he intended to leave Manchester City to further his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham ready for Manchester City exit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18721399|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 2012, Cunningham signed a four-year contract at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City defender Greg Cunningham joins Bristol City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18721392|work=BBC Sport|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham made his debut on the opening game of the season, in a 1–0 loss against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Then, in a 2–1 win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], on 18 September 2012, Cunningham received a heavy tackle from [[Tyrone Barnett]] after Barnett made a reckless challenge on him, which resulted in Cunningham being stretched off and Barnett being booked. After the match, [[Derek McInnes]] believes that Barnett should have been sent-off for the challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol City manager Derek McInnes bemoans 'reckless' tackles|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19647453|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham was ruled out for two months after rupturing his tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham: Bristol City defender out for two months|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19647458|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2012|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-December, Cunningham recovered from the injury and made his return in a 2–0 loss against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 15 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham could make Bristol City return this weekend|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Greg-Cunningham-make-Bristol-City-return-weekend/story-17577880-detail/story.html|publisher=Bristol Post|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=8 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000839/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Greg-Cunningham-make-Bristol-City-return-weekend/story-17577880-detail/story.html|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2013, Cunningham scored his first goal for Bristol City against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], a cross that had looped over [[Almunia|Manuel Alumunia]] and found its way into the back of the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bristol City 2–0 Watford|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21137530|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his recovery from injury, Cunningham continued to retain his first team place in the left-back position, though sometimes plays in the left-midfield, but unfortunately, the club was relegated to League One.

===Preston North End===
Bristol City gave Cunningham permission to speak to Preston North End after accepting an undisclosed bid, he spent the weekend with Preston in Scotland at a training camp before the deal was completed on 27 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preston Close to Cunningham Signing|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33674016|work=BBC Sport|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2017, Cunningham was appointed captain of Preston until such a time as [[Tom Clarke (footballer, born 1987)|Tom Clarke]] became fit again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Named Stand-In Captain|url= https://www.pnefc.net/news/2017/july/greg-named-stand-in-captain/|work=Preston North End FC|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City===

On 13 June 2018, Cunningham joined [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £4 million signing a 3-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Cunningham: Cardiff City sign Preston North End defender|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44380823|work=BBC Sport|date=13 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham had been capped by the Republic of Ireland at youth level before being called up to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|senior]] international squad by manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] on 22 February 2010 for a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0222/republicofireland_brazil.html|title=Trapattoni names 23-man squad for Brazil|date=22 February 2010|publisher=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=22 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224073852/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0222/republicofireland_brazil.html|archivedate=24 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2010, Cunningham made his debut for Ireland in a 3–0 win against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] at the [[RDS Arena|RDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0527/ireland_cunninghamg.html|title=Greg Cunningham set to make Ireland debut|date=27 May 2010|publisher=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/8712258.stm|title=Rep of Ireland 3–0 Algeria|date=28 May 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
