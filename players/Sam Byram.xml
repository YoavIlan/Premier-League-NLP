'''Samuel Mark Byram''' (born 16 September 1993) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], on loan from [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He primarily plays as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], but can also play as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right midfielder or right winger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luke showed what we've been miss-ing!|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/luke-showed-what-we-ve-been-miss-ing-1-5082500|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byram was called up to the [[England national under-20 football team|England Under 20 team]] for the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] but withdrew from the squad through injury and remains uncapped at international level.

==Club career==
Byram was born in [[Thurrock]], [[Essex]],&lt;ref name="Hugman"/&gt; before moving north, where he attended Ralph Butterfield Primary School, [[Haxby]], and then [[Joseph Rowntree School]] in [[York]]. He played for the City Schools team as a boy before joining [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/archive/2003/10/15/York+Archive/7898168.print/ | title = Five-star York are in fine Nick | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = York Press. | date = 15 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his secondary education at school, he signed scholar forms with the West Yorkshire club in 2010. During his first year as scholar, he played 'down' a year in the under-16 team to help his development as a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120820/sam-signs-up-for-the-future_2247585_2895119 | title = SAM SIGNS UP FOR THE FUTURE | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later progressed to his age group in the under-18s where he would become a regular in the team during his second year in 2011–12. As an integral part of the team, he scored several goals over the course of the season as the under-18s finished as runners-up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in their divisional academy league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120425/united-pride-in-runners-up-spot_2247585_2748334 | title = UNITED PRIDE IN RUNNERS-UP SPOT | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 25 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120531132718/http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120425/united-pride-in-runners-up-spot_2247585_2748334# | archive-date = 31 May 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the season in May 2012, he was one of five young players rewarded with their first professional contracts for their performances in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120502/the-magnificent-seven_2247585_2757299 | title = THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leeds United===

====2012–13 season====
[[File:Sam Byram.jpg|thumb|175px|Byram playing for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2012]]

In the first friendly match of Leeds United's 2012–13 pre-season against [[Farsley Celtic F.C.|Farsley Celtic]], Byram was one of a number of youngsters given an opportunity to impress manager [[Neil Warnock]] when he lined up for the second half at [[Throstle Nest]].&lt;ref name="Vital Football"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leeds.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=287701 | title = LUFC Five star Leeds see off Farsley Celtic | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Vital Football | date = 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; United recorded a convincing 5–2 victory over their city rivals.&lt;ref name="Vital Football"/&gt; Nevertheless, he would travel with the first-team on their summer tour of the South West of England the following week, featuring in the games against [[Tavistock A.F.C.|Tavistock]], [[Bodmin Town F.C.|Bodmin Town]] and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120723/united-hit-tavistock-for-six_2247585_2857883 | title = UNITED HIT TAVISTOCK FOR SIX | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120725/four-star-united-win-at-bodmin_2247585_2860492 | title = FOUR-STAR UNITED WIN AT BODMIN | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120727/south-west-tour-ends-on-a-high_2247585_2863115 | title = SOUTH WEST TOUR ENDS ON A HIGH | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram remained as part of the first-team in pre-season after returning to the North; playing for an hour and scoring in the game away to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120804/three-of-the-best-see-off-preston_2247585_2870743 | title = THREE OF THE BEST SEE OFF PRESTON | accessdate = 4 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After impressing in pre-season, Byram was handed the number 25 shirt for the season ahead and he made his first team debut at [[Elland Road]] in a 4–0 victory over [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] on 11 August in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120811/shrewsbury-live_2247585_2878205 | title = SHREWSBURY LIVE | accessdate = 11 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram retained his place in the first-team the following week in United's first league game of the campaign against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He was part of a defence that kept a clean-sheet in a 1–0 victory over one of the early favourites for promotion and his performance out-wide against the [[England national football team|England]] international [[Matt Jarvis]] won praise from several observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120818/united-open-up-with-a-winner_2247585_2889721 | title = Becchio goal secures win against Wolves... | accessdate = 18 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new three-year contract with the West Yorkshire club two days after his league debut and only three months after signing his first professional contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120820/sam-signs-up-for-the-future_2247585_2895119 | title = Sam Signs Up for the Future | accessdate = 20 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C. | date = 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byram scored his first professional goal on 28 August in the 3–0 League Cup second-round victory over [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]. Picking up the ball just outside the penalty area, he beat two Oxford defenders with his first and second touches before chipping the goalkeeper from inside the box in the 34th minute to give his team a 2–0 lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120828/oxford-live_2247585_2902951 | title = OXFORD LIVE | accessdate = 28 August 2012 | publisher = Leeds United F.C.| date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An impressed Neil Warnock told reporters after the game that "Sam will probably never score another goal like that in his career".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/football/live/match-reaction/273452/warnock-pleased-with-cup-win | title = Warnock Pleased with Cup Win | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | work = Sporting Life| date = 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram remained a permanent feature in the first-team squad during the early months of the season with United legend [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] tipping him to win a call-up to [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] squad in the near future if he maintained his form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.lufcchat.com/legends-on-leeds/gray-on-leeds | title = Gray on Leeds – Byram's got the goods to follow Lees' international call | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | publisher = LUFC Chat| date = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former manager in the under-18s, [[Neil Redfearn]], stated that Byram's rise through the ranks at the club served as a good example for other promising youngsters including his former teammates in the academy side, Ross Killock, [[Dominic Poleon]] and Simon Lenighan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20120905/sams-a-shining-light-for-youngsters_2247585_2909567 | title = SAM'S A SHINING LIGHT FOR YOUNGSTERS | accessdate = 23 September 2012 | work = Sporting Life| date = 5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October, he scored his first league goal for Leeds in a 2–2 draw away to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], heading in a cross from [[El Hadji Diouf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19709796 "Bolton 2–2 Leeds"] BBC Sport. 2 October 2012.

After his impressive form for Leeds linked him with [[Premier League]] interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sam Byram agrees new deal with Leeds United|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/8441406|work=Sky Sports News|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byram signed a new contract with Leeds on 26 January 2013, to extend his stay at the club until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAM'S SET TO SIGN FOR THE FUTURE|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20130126/sams-set-to-sign-for-the-future_2247585_3054085|work=Leeds United A.F.C|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second league goal for the club on 6 March, in a 1–1 draw away at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21583959 "Leicester 1–1 Leeds"] BBC Sport. 6 March 2013. Retrieved 9 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and followed this up with the equaliser in another 1–1 draw, at home to [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].

On 26 April 2013, Byram won the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' Player of the Season award with 99% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

====2013–14 season====
The hip injury sustained at the end of the 2012–13 season ruled Byram out of the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20]]'s World Cup. Bryam's injury caused him to miss the entire 2013–14 pre-season friendlies for Leeds. After missing the start of the 2013–14 season, on 6 August Leeds manager [[Brian McDermott (footballer)|Brian McDermott]] announced that Byram had an injection in his hip and the injury may require surgery which could potentially rule him out for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Byram made his first-team return on 21 September 2013, playing 57 minutes in Leeds' 2–1 defeat against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. He also played Leeds' next game, a League Cup defeat to Newcastle United, playing the full 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="CUP EXIT AT NEWCASTLE"&gt;{{Cite news

====2014–15 season====
On 1 August, Byram was assigned the Leeds number 2 shirt for the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name="SQUAD NUMBERS RELEASED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/1wncxa2kw0zr11fmlyjr0m3t53/title/squad-numbers-released|title=SQUAD NUMBERS RELEASED|publisher=Leeds United F.C.|date=1 August 2014 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] manager [[Ronald Koeman]] confirmed that Leeds had rejected a bid of £4.5&amp;nbsp;million to sign Byram.&lt;ref name="Southampton's £4.5m bid for young defender Sam Byram rejected by Leeds"&gt;{{Cite news

Byram scored his fourth goal for Leeds in a 2–1 win against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Hudderfield Town]] on 31 January. In 2015, head coach Neil Redfearn changed Leeds' formation to a 4–2–3–1 with Byram moved forward into an attacking right wing position, with [[Scott Wootton]] played as the regular right back. Byram scored the second goal in a 2–0 away win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 10 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
