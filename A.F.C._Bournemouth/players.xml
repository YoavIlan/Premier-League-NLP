'''Artur Boruc''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈartur ˈbɔrut͡s}}; born 20 February 1980) is a Polish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]].

He began his career in the Polish third division with hometown club [[Miejski Klub Piłkarski Pogoń Siedlce|Pogoń Siedlce]]. He joined [[Ekstraklasa]] team [[Legia Warsaw]] in 1999 and, whilst still a reserve, had a spell on loan at [[Dolcan Ząbki]] in 2000. Boruc broke through to the Legia first team in 2002 and by 2003 had become the club's first choice goalkeeper. In the summer of 2005, he joined [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. In his five years in Glasgow, Boruc made 221 appearances for the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player.php?playerid=2910 |title=Celtic Player Artur Boruc Details |publisher=Fitbastats.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the league three times, the [[Scottish Cup]] once and the [[Scottish League Cup]] twice. Celtic fans nicknamed Boruc 'The Holy Goalie' for his devout Catholicism. He moved to Italy in 2010 to join [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], spending two years at the [[Serie A]] club before returning to Britain in 2012 to sign for [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], moving to Bournemouth in 2015 after a season on loan.

Boruc made his international debut against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in April 2004 and became a regular in the [[Poland national football team|Polish]] international squad, earning 65 caps. He represented the nation at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. On November 2017 Boruc retired from international football.

==Club career==
===Pogoń Siedlce===
Born in [[Siedlce]], Boruc began his career in 1998 at [[Miejski Klub Piłkarski Pogoń Siedlce|Pogoń Siedlce]], in his hometown.&lt;ref&gt;S.Kindziuk (2011). ''90 years of football in Siedlce. Season by season''. Siedlce. p. 343-344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legia Warsaw===
[[File:Artur Boruc.jpg|left|thumb|Artur Boruc in his Legia playing days]]The next season Boruc joined [[Legia Warsaw]], initially playing for the reserve team, as well as being loaned out in 2000 for half a season to [[Dolcan Ząbki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krok w tył i dwa do przodu. Artur Boruc w Dolcanie Ząbki |language=pl |website=Numer 10 |url=http://numer10.blox.pl/2010/02/Krok-w-tyl-i-dwa-do-przodu-Artur-Boruc-w-Dolcanie.html|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2002, Boruc played his first league match for Legia when he came on as a substitute during a 2–2 draw against [[Pogoń Szczecin]]. This unexpected debut was due to an injury sustained by Bulgarian goalkeeper, [[Radostin Stanev]], during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=5378746193&amp;BlogId=5549745208 |title=Blog |work=Bebo |date= |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legia.net/historia/index.php?s=mecz&amp;id=2244 |title=Historia Legii Warszawa |language=pl |website=Legia.Net |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc played in Legia's next four league matches and kept clean sheets against [[Wisła Kraków]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legia.net/historia/index.php?s=mecz&amp;id=2245 |title=Historia Legii Warszawa |language=pl |website=Legia.Net |date=15 March 2002 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Odra Wodzisław]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legia.net/historia/index.php?s=mecz&amp;id=2269 |title=Historia Legii Warszawa |language=pl |website=Legia.Net |date=20 March 2002 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Stanev regained his place in the side upon his return from injury for the remaining league and cup fixtures. Legia went on to win the [[Ekstraklasa]] title that season for the first time in seven years.

In the second half of the following season, 2002–03, Boruc established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper where he played in 11 of the club's last 15 league fixtures.&lt;ref name="Boruc 2002-03"&gt;{{cite web|author=Maciej Kusina |url=http://www.90minut.pl/wystepy.php?id=2624&amp;id_sezon=61 |title=Artur Boruc |website=90minut.pl |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legia lost only 1 of these 11 matches and Boruc kept 5 clean sheets,&lt;ref name="Boruc 2002-03" /&gt; although Legia only managed to finish fourth.

By the 2003–04 season, Boruc was very much a first-pick for Legia and played in all 26 of their league fixtures.&lt;ref name="Ninety"&gt;{{cite web|first=Maciej |last=Kusina |url=http://www.90minut.pl/wystepy.php?id=2624&amp;id_sezon=65 |title=Artur Boruc |website=90minut.pl |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, Boruc scored his only goal for the club, converting a penalty kick in a home game against [[Widzew Łódź]] (final score: 6–0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legionisci.com/mecz/141 |title=Legioniści – serwis dla kibiców Legii Warszawa |website=Legionisci.com |date=8 June 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goal/&gt; and then celebrated by waving the corner flag. Legia finished second in the league and qualified for the following season's [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legia.com/podstrona,101-historia_legii___1996_2005.html |title=Legia Warszawa – Strona Oficjalna Historia Legii – 1996–2005 |website=Legia.com |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc also made his first appearance for Poland in April 2004, playing in a scoreless draw against the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name="debut1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Maciej |last=Kusina |url=http://www.90minut.pl/mecz.php?id_mecz=165236 |title=Polska 0–0 Irlandia |website=90minut.pl |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debut2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legia.net/index.php?typ=news&amp;id=6243 |title=Legia Warszawa – Artur Boruc o swoim debiucie |language=pl |website=Legia.Net |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004–05 season saw Boruc remain Legia's key player and a fan-favourite, again playing in all of the club's league fixtures.&lt;ref name="Ninety" /&gt; Boruc's performances for Legia saw the club extend his contract up to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=219510.html |title=UEFA Europa League – News |website=Uefa.com |date=26 August 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, Boruc was made captain of the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legia.net/index.php?typ=news&amp;id=17445 |title=Legia Warszawa – Artur Boruc kapitanem Legii |language=pl |website=Legia.Net |date=23 April 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was another disappointing league campaign for Legia, as they came a distant third behind Wisła Kraków who finished as champions for the third year in a row. Legia's UEFA Cup run was also relatively brief, disposing of [[FC Tbilisi]] 7–0 on aggregate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefinalball.com/jogo.php?id=94350 |title=Legia Warszawa 6–0 FC Tbilisi :: UEFA Cup 2004/05 |website=footballzz.co.uk |date=26 August 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220603/http://www.footballzz.co.uk/jogo.php?id=94350 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a relatively easy qualifying tie before going out 1–4 on aggregate in the first-round proper to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2004/matches/round=1975/match=79563/postmatch/report/index.html |title=UEFA Europa League 2004/05 – History – Legia-Austria Wien – |website=Uefa.com |date=30 September 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of silverware though, Boruc's form was by the summer of 2005 attracting attention from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4637677.stm |title=Celtic keep tabs on Legia keeper |work=BBC Sport |date=30 June 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic===
On 20 July 2005, Boruc signed with Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. The deal was initially a year's loan, with an option to make it permanent.&lt;ref name=bbc050713/&gt; The move was later made permanent, with Boruc penning a three-and-a-half-year contract on 17 October until 2009.&lt;ref name=bbc051017/&gt; On 5 January 2008, it was reported that Boruc had signed a new contract with Celtic set to keep him at the club until 2011.&lt;ref name=ab080105/&gt;

Boruc made his debut for Celtic on 2 August 2005 when he replaced [[David Marshall (footballer)|David Marshall]] for the second leg of their UEFA Champions League qualifier tie against Slovakian side [[FC Petržalka akadémia|Artmedia Bratislava]].&lt;ref name = "artmedia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4735857.stm |title=Celtic 4–0 Artmedia Bratislava |work=BBC Sport |date=2 August 2005 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic won 4–0, but having lost the first leg 5–0 still went out on aggregate.&lt;ref name = "artmedia"/&gt; Boruc quickly established himself as first-choice keeper at Celtic, displaying a combination of outstanding shot-stopping, immense self-belief and, at times, outright arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/celtic-need-more-players-with-artur-1013283 |title=Celtic need more players with Artur Boruc's arrogance, says Bhoys legend Bertie Auld |first=Neil |last=Cameron |work=Daily Record |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theterraceradio.podbean.com/2011/02/03/spl-supervillains/ |title=SPL SuperVillains &amp;#124; The Terrace Scottish Football Podcast |work=The Terrace Radio |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, gestures allegedly made by Boruc towards [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fans at [[Ibrox Stadium]] on 12 February 2006 later resulted in the player being cautioned by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5292656.stm |title=Player caution 'not for blessing' |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season, he made 40 appearances and kept 17 clean sheets.&lt;ref name="fitbastats1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player.php?playerid=2910 |title=Celtic Player Artur Boruc Details |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc also added to his winner's medals collection as Celtic won the [[Scottish Premier League]]&lt;ref name="lg06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4873944.stm |title=Celtic 1–0 Hearts |work=BBC Sport|date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scottish League Cup]], the latter after beating [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] 3–0.&lt;ref name="pars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youngpars.co.uk/story.php?ID=2063&amp;CATEGORY=7-Match%20Reports |title=Young Pars |work=Young Pars |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artur Boruc Dinamo Moscow Celts.jpg|thumb|Boruc playing for Celtic in 2009]]
Boruc continued his fine form for Celtic the following season. On 21 November 2006, in a [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Celtic Park]], Boruc helped Celtic through to the knockout stage of the competition by saving [[Louis Saha]]'s 89th-minute penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moffat |first=Colin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6160910.stm |title=Celtic 1–0 Man Utd |work=BBC Sport |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Boruc succeeded in keeping a clean sheet in each of Celtic's three home Champions League group stages games ([[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] 1–0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Ewan|title=Miller keeps his cool to fire Strachan's Celtic dawn in Europe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/27/match.sport2|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[S.L.

He was named player of the month for December 2006 in the [[Scottish Premier League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/6255869.stm |title=Boruc named player of the month |work=BBC Sport |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a very uncommon event for a goalkeeper. His form was also recognised with a nomination for the [[Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award for 2007.&lt;ref name=bbc070412/&gt; The season culminated in more silverware for Boruc as Celtic retained their Scottish Premier League title&lt;ref name="lg07"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/6574335.stm |title=Kilmarnock 1–2 Celtic |first=Colin |last=Moffat |work=BBC |date=22 April 2007 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated Dunfermline 1–0 on 26 May 2007 to win the [[Scottish Cup]].&lt;ref name="pars2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youngpars.co.uk/story.php?ID=2418&amp;CATEGORY=7-Match%20Reports |title=Young Pars |work=Young Pars |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the 2007–08 season saw Celtic drawn against Russian side [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in the third qualifying round for the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. The tie ended in a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], with Boruc saving twice to ensure Celtic's passage to the group stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moffat |first=Colin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6966717.stm |title=Celtic 1–1 Spartak Moscow (2–2) |work=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season also saw Celtic complete a [[Hat trick|hat-trick]] of consecutive Scottish Premier League titles.&lt;ref name="lg08"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ewan |last=Murray |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/23/scottishpremierleague.dundeeunited |title=Scottish Premier League: Dundee Utd 0–1 Celtic |work=The Guardian |date=22 May 2008|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boruc was fined an estimated £50,000 by Celtic in August 2008 for breaching the club's drinking policy after a pre-season friendly in the Netherlands against [[Feyenoord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith |last=Jackson |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/other-sports/exclusive-artur-boruc-fined-50000-988020 |title=Exclusive: Artur Boruc fined £50,000 by Celtic over drinking antics |work=Daily Record |date=23 August 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boruc endured a decline of form in the first half of season 2008–09 as he committed several goalkeeping errors, in particular against Rangers in a 2–4 defeat at Parkhead on 31 August 2008 where he was badly at fault for Rangers fourth goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard |last=Swains |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/31/celtic.rangers |title=Scottish Premier: Kenny Miller scores twice as Rangers beat Celtic 4–2 at Parkhead |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Easter Road]] on 7 December 2008, where [[John Rankin (footballer)|John Rankin]] scored against him from 45 yards out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Greechan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1092662/Hibernian-2-Celtic-0-Boruc-blunder-hands-Hibs-shock-home-win.html |title=Hibernian 2 Celtic 0: Boruc blunder hands Hibs shock home win |work=Mail Online |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a goal Rankin later referred to as a "squiggler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoffside.com/leagues/scottish-premier-league/it-wasnt-a-boruc-howler-it-was-a-rankin-squiggler.html?mypulldown2= |title=It Wasn't a Boruc Howler, It Was a Rankin "Squiggler" |work=The Offside |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630103210/http://www.theoffside.com/leagues/scottish-premier-league/it-wasnt-a-boruc-howler-it-was-a-rankin-squiggler.html?mypulldown2= |archivedate=30 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did however save a [[James McArthur]] penalty in a 4–0 win over [[Hamilton Academical]] on 4 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 28 January 2009, Boruc converted a penalty for Celtic during the penalty shootout in the semi-final match of the [[Scottish League Cup 2008–09#Semi-finals|League Cup]] against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], helping Celtic to an 11–10 win on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob Parker |url=http://www.offthepost.info/blog/2009/01/football-video-artur-boruc-scores-penalty-as-celtic-beat-dundee-united-11-10-in-shootout/ |title=Football video: Artur Boruc scores penalty as Celtic beat Dundee United 11–10 in shootout |work=Off the Post |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc picked up his last silverware at Celtic in the same tournament a couple of months later when Celtic defeated Rangers 2–0 after extra-time in the Scottish League Cup Final.&lt;ref name="gers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7941624.stm |title=Celtic 2–0 Rangers |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |work=BBC Sport |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2009, Boruc made his 200th appearance for Celtic against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], which Celtic won 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videocelts.com/2010/07/blogs/holy-goalie-supporters-tributes-to-artur-boruc |title=Holy Goalie: Supporter tributes to Artur Boruc |work=Video Celts |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, he won the Scottish Premier League save of the season award for a reflex save against Hibernian at Easter Road in August 2009.&lt;ref name=bbc100419/&gt;

On 4 May 2010, Boruc made the last appearance of his Celtic career in a 2–1 victory against Old Firm rivals Rangers,&lt;ref name=bbc100504/&gt; although he had to be substituted in the second half as he was unable to continue playing due to an injury he sustained to his hand in the pre-match warm up. This transpired to be a broken finger and ruled him out of the final league fixture of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football.co.uk/celtic/boruc_missing_for_hearts_clash_rss765218.shtml |title=Boruc missing for Hearts clash |website=football.co.uk |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2011, Boruc officially claimed Fiorentina's number one jersey after Frey's move to [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref name=viola110821/&gt; For the next year, Boruc played in all but two of Fiorentina's Serie A fixtures, but despite this he was criticised for some of his performances and apparent lack of fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballitaliano.co.uk/p6_65_6824_fiorentina-plan-novara-line-up-without-gilardino.html#.UaRhptKRASs |title=Fiorentina plan Novara line-up without Gilardino |website=Footballitaliano.co.uk |date=7 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftbpro.com/posts/joel.amorim/50609/boruc-is-next-in-line |title=Boruc is next in line |work=FTBpro |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029211338/http://www.ftbpro.com/posts/joel.amorim/50609/boruc-is-next-in-line |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two seasons in Italy, Boruc was released by Fiorentina in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/player/0,,11866_249119,00.html |title=Artur Boruc, Southampton – Football Stats |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southampton===
On 22 September 2012, Boruc joined [[Premier League]] club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on a one-year deal.&lt;ref name=saints120923/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc120922/&gt; He made his debut on 20 October in a 4–1 defeat away to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at [[Upton Park (stadium)|Upton Park]].&lt;ref name=bbc121020/&gt;

On 28 October 2012, he was allegedly involved in an incident following [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s second goal, when he responded to the jeers coming from behind him by sarcastically applauding the home fans, before throwing a water bottle in their direction.&lt;ref name=tg121101/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc121030/&gt; The incident resulted in Boruc being dropped from the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/southampton-boss-adkins-dropped-boruc-investigation-continues-3622641 |title=Southampton boss Adkins dropped Boruc as investigation continues |work=Tribal Football |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early controversy in his Southampton career, Boruc regained his place in the first team and played in all the club's league matches from 1 January 2013 to the end of the season. On 9 March 2013 in a league match against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] at [[Carrow Road]], Boruc saved a penalty in the 90th minute from [[Grant Holt]]. The game finished 0–0, with Southampton winning a point in their bid to avoid relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Callow|first=James|title=Artur Boruc saves Southampton's skin as Norwich pay the penalty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/09/norwich-city-southampton-premier-league|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2013|date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc's form since returning to the Southampton first team resulted in manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]] expressing a desire for Boruc to be signed up on a longer-term deal at Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/10295342.Poch_wants_keeper_to_stay/ |work=Daily Echo |date=18 March 2013 |title=Poch wants keeper Boruc to stay}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2013 this wish was realised when Boruc signed a new 2-year contract for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22205197 |title=Artur Boruc signs new Southampton contract |work=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southampton's 1–1 draw with Sunderland on 12 May 2013 ensured their Premier League status for the following season.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/matches/2012-2013/epl.html/sunderland-vs-southampton |title=Sunderland vs Southampton |website=Premierleague.com |date=19 May 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they eventually finished in 14th place at the end of season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/tables/9484362/Premier-League-table-2012-13.html |title=Premier League table 2012-13 |work=The Telegraph |date= 18 August 2012|accessdate=3 August 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now firmly established as first-choice goalkeeper at Southampton, Boruc helped his team make an excellent start to the [[2013–14 Southampton F.C. season|2013–14 season]]. The club's 2–0 win over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 26 October 2013 saw the team move to 18 points and into third place in the Premier League, their best-ever start to a [[English football league system#Structure|top-flight]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3631255 |title=Match Report: Southampton 2 Fulham 0 |website=Saintsfc.co.uk |date=26 October 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevan |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24591247 |title=Southampton 2–0 Fulham |work=BBC Sport |date=26 October 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2013, in a 1–1 draw at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], Boruc conceded a goal to opposing goalkeeper [[Asmir Begović]] after just 13 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKenna |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24681360 |title=Stoke City 1–1 Southampton |work=BBC Sport |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, under pressure from Arsenal's [[Olivier Giroud]], "instead of simply clearing he did one [[Cruyff turn]], then another, before tying himself into so many knots attempting a third that Giroud was able to nick the ball off him" and score the first of Arsenal's two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-2-southampton-0-match-report-artur-boruc-howler-and-olivier-giroud-double-vision-keeps-title-in-focus-for-arsenal-8959495.html |title=Arsenal 2 Southampton 0 match report: Artur Boruc howler and Olivier Giroud double vision keeps title in focus for Arsenal |first=Glenn |last=Moore |work=The Independent |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, he suffered a broken hand trying to keep out a [[Demba Ba]] goal in a 3–1 defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which kept him out for six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artur Boruc: Southampton keeper out for six weeks with broken hand|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25180347|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 December 2013|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc returned from injury on 11 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/boruc-buoyed-southampton-return |title=Boruc buoyed by Southampton return |work=FourFourTwo |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kept a clean sheet in Southampton's 1–0 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], impressing with a last minute save from [[Shane Long]] to deny the club an equaliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Ryan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2537315/Southampton-1-West-Brom-0-match-report-Mums-word-Adam-Lallana-sees-Baggies-new-boss-Pepe-Mel.html |title=Southampton 1 West Brom 0: Lallana's winner is the perfect present for Mum |work=Mail Online |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/11/southampton-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league |title=Southampton 1–0 West Bromwich Albion |work=The Guardian |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc maintained his place in his side, and although he was at fault for one of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]'s goals in a 2–2 draw on 18 January,&lt;ref name="hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artur Boruc|url=http://www.thesaintshub.com/arturboruc.html |work=The Saints Hub|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he redeemed himself with better performances in 1–0 and 3–0 league wins over Fulham and [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]] respectively during February 2014.&lt;ref name="hub" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLoughlin|first=Brendan|title=Fulham 0 – 3 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25892225|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 September 2014|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Begley|first1=Emlyn|title=Hull 0 – 1 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26027957|work=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form remained reasonably consistent, although his distribution was occasionally poor,&lt;ref name="hub" /&gt; and he helped Southampton to an eighth-place finish in the league at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Jeremy|title=Southampton Premier League season review for 2013–14|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/10810626/southampton-premier-league-season-review-2013-14.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 September 2014|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
At the start of the [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 season]], [[Fraser Forster]] arrived at Southampton from Celtic in a £10 million transfer deal, with the Englishman taking over Boruc's place in goal. On 19 September 2014, Boruc joined [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[AFC Bournemouth]] on an emergency loan deal until January 2015. He made his debut the following day in a 1–1 draw away against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodcock|first=Ian|title=Watford 1–1 Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29186727|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 September 2014|date=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, Bournemouth won 0–8 away at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game (barring a 10–0 win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in September 1939 which was expunged from the records after World War II broke out the next day), and they recorded their biggest winning margin in a league fixture. Boruc played his part in this statistic by saving a penalty taken by [[Paul Caddis]] in the 53rd minute with the score at 0–3.&lt;ref name="bbc 2014-10-25"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29669693 |title=Managerless Birmingham City suffered a humiliating defeat as Bournemouth scored eight goals at St Andrew's |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 October 2014 |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loan spell at Bournemouth went well, and by the end of December 2014, Boruc had kept clean sheets in nine of his 18 appearances, helping the club go top of the Championship. As such, the loan was extended to the end of the season, with Boruc commenting, "I'm pleased I'm here and that I'm part of a great team, and that's why I'm staying until the end of the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artur Boruc: AFC Bournemouth extend loan until end of season|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30643674|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 February 2015|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2015, Boruc was part of the Bournemouth team which won the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref name=Champions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759|title=Charlton 0 Bournemouth 3|work=BBC Sport|date=2 May 2015 |accessdate =3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four days later, he was one of six players released by Southampton,

Boruc began the [[2015–16 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2015–16 season]] as Bournemouth's first choice goalkeeper, starting the club's first ever top division match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 8 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33744565|title=Bournemouth 0–1 Aston Villa|date=8 August 2015|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; His and the club's first clean sheet came in a 2–0 defeat of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Dean Court]] on 19 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34191881|title=Bournemouth 2–0 Sunderland|date=19 September 2015|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a poor performance in a 1–5 home defeat by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 25 October, Boruc was replaced in the Bournemouth goal by [[Adam Federici]] for all four of the Cherries' November fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/bournemouth-0-1-newcastle-5-6756730|title=Bournemouth 0–1 Newcastle: 5 things we learned as Rob Elliot heroics earn Magpies three points |date=7 November 2015|work=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; An injury to Federici saw Boruc return to the side for an away fixture at [[List of English football champions|Premier League champions]] [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 5 December, with the Polish goalkeeper keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win for Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34951749|title=Chelsea 0–1 Bournemouth|date=5 December 2015|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Boruc was a member of the Bournemouth side that beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–1 at Dean Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35014111|title=Bournemouth 2–1 Man Utd|date=12 December 2015 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2018 he signed a new contract with [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], keeping him at the club until the summer of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afcb.co.uk/news/first-team/artur-boruc-signs-new-contract|title=Artur Boruc signs new contract|website=AFCB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:ArturBoruc.jpg|thumb|Boruc with the Polish national team in November 2013]]
Boruc's debut for [[Poland national football team|Poland]] came on 28 April 2004 in a friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], coming on as second-half substitute for [[Jerzy Dudek]], with the match ending in a goalless draw.&lt;ref name="debut1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="debut2" /&gt; Boruc made his first starting appearance for Poland with his third cap, a friendly on 12 July 2004 in [[Chicago]] against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maciej Kusina |url=http://www.90minut.pl/mecz.php?id_mecz=165237 |title=USA 1–1 Polska |website=90minut.pl |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boruc saved a penalty in the 11th minute from American striker [[Brian McBride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2004/07/12/us_team_salvages_tie_with_poland/|title=US team salvages tie with Poland – The Boston Globe|website=www.boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boruc soon established himself as a regular in the Polish squad and was selected to the 23-men national squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals held in Germany. He had been battling with [[Tomasz Kuszczak]] and also [[Łukasz Fabiański]] for the starting slot, but was first-choice goalkeeper during the World Cup and played in all three of their games. Boruc was particularly outstanding in the game against [[Germany national football team|Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4852960.stm |title=World Cup 2006 Germany 1–0 Poland |work=BBC News |date= 14 June 2006|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was unable to prevent his country losing 1–0.

Boruc remained first choice goalkeeper and was named in Poland's [[UEFA Euro 2008]] squad. He played their first game against Germany and held his place through to the important second game against co-hosts Austria in which the Poles conceded a penalty in the 92nd minute to level the game. In the same match, he saved all three shots by the Austrians, leading to a final score of 1–1. He was nicknamed "Spaceman" by the Austrian and German press during the tournament.&lt;ref name=SL080526/&gt; The famous Polish striker from the late 1970s and 1980s, [[Zbigniew Boniek]], criticised Poland's team performance at Euro 2008 but singled out Boruc for praise, describing him as "world class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.dziennik.pl/pilka-nozna/artykuly/129506,boniek-tylko-boruc-ma-swiatowy-poziom.html|work=Dziennik Sport|date=16 June 2008|title=Boniek: Only Boruc is world class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boruc incurred the wrath of manager [[Leo Beenhakker]] in August 2008 when he and two teammates went on a night out after a friendly against [[Ukrainian national football team|Ukraine]] in defiance of the orders of their manager.

Boruc made 64 appearances for his country, his last appearance coming in a friendly on 14 November 2016 against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], playing the first half before being substituted at half time in a 1–1 draw. His appearance in that game saw him become the most highly capped goalkeeper for Poland, passing [[Jan Tomaszewski]]'s record of 63 caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobek|first=Dariusz|title=Artur Boruc pobił rekord w liczbie występów w reprezentacji Polski wśród bramkarzy|url=http://eurosport.onet.pl/pilka-nozna/kadra/artur-boruc-pobil-rekord-w-liczbie-wystepow-w-reprezentacji-polski-wsrod-bramkarzy/552nc7|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=onet.sport (Eurosport)|date=14 November 2015 |trans-title=Artur Boruc breaks record number of appearances for the Polish national team among goalkeepers |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internationals: Landmark Poland appearance for Artur Boruc|url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/internationals-landmark-poland-appearance-for-artur-boruc-3417050.aspx|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=AFC Bournemouth|date=15 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122153249/http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/internationals-landmark-poland-appearance-for-artur-boruc-3417050.aspx|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Boruc announced his retirement from international football, through his Instagram profile, citing his age, "peace of mind" regarding the position of a Polish goalkeeper, and focusing on his career in Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenews.pl/1/5/Artykul/295823,Artur-Boruc-bids-farewell-to-Poland-squad|title=Artur Boruc bids farewell to Poland squad|date=1 March 2017|publisher=Radio Poland|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his final 65th cap at his farewell match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] on 10 November 2017 in Warsaw, being substituted shortly before half-time by former [[Legia Warsaw|Legia Warszawa]] teammate, [[Łukasz Fabiański]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/poland-vs-uruguay/teams/385535|title=Poland 0 Uruguay 0|date=10 November 2017|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Boruc was at the centre of many controversies during his Celtic tenure.

On 25 August 2006, Boruc was cautioned by the [[Strathclyde Police]] for a [[breach of the peace]] for making gestures in front of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fans before a game earlier that year.&lt;ref name=Herald20060827/&gt; According to the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', "police reports highlighted three hand gestures made by 26-year-old Boruc ... a [[V sign]] at the crowd, another obscene gesture at the crowd and a [[blessing]]." The gestures were not caught on video and the [[police caution|caution]] was issued on the basis of police reports and [[witness]] statements.&lt;ref name=Herald20060827/&gt; This incident has led to him attaining the nickname "The Holy Goalie".&lt;ref name=herald080303/&gt;

The [[Procurator Fiscal]] said Boruc "was seen by members of the public and police officers to bless himself. Witnesses describe him smiling or laughing at a Rangers section of the crowd and making 'come on' gestures. This action appeared to incense a section of the crowd to react in such a way that police officers and security personnel had to become involved to calm the situation. The police reported that it took 10 minutes to restore normality in the crowd."&lt;ref name=copfs0608/&gt; According to a cross-party [[working group]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]], "the sign of the cross in itself is an expression of the Roman Catholic faith; however, using it to alarm, upset or provoke others might be a breach of the peace at [[common law]]."&lt;ref name=sg021205/&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] condemned the legal action, however, expressing regret that "Scotland seems to have made itself one of the few countries in the world where this simple religious gesture is considered an offence."&lt;ref name=guardian060827/&gt; Following extensive press comment, the [[Crown Office]] issued a statement on 28 August 2006 stressing that the "very limited" action had been taken against Boruc for gestures made toward Rangers supporters rather than for crossing himself, and that it would not take action against individuals for "acts of religious observance."&lt;ref name=bbc060828/&gt; According to [[BBC News Online]], the caution "brought the issue of [[sectarianism]] in Scotland back into sharp focus."&lt;ref name=bbc060826/&gt; The Roman Catholic Church welcomed the Crown Office's clarification of the limited action taken against Boruc, particularly the statement that it "did not in any way refer to the act of blessing himself."&lt;ref name=scm060628/&gt;

On 17 December 2006, Boruc again crossed himself during his first Old Firm game since the caution, drawing "a roar" from the Rangers fans behind his goal.&lt;ref name=scotsman20061218/&gt;&lt;ref name=yt061217/&gt; A spokesman for Celtic defended his gesture, stating "the police have said they have no problem with Artur Boruc in this regard and neither does Celtic Football Club."&lt;ref name=scotsman20061218/&gt;

Boruc courted further controversy in April 2008 when he displayed a T-shirt saying "God bless the Pope" and bearing a picture of [[Pope John Paul II]] after a game against Rangers,&lt;ref name=bbc080430/&gt; and also in May 2007 when he waved a flag proclaiming Celtic the "champions" following a match against Rangers.&lt;ref name=bbc070509/&gt;

==Personal life==
Boruc is a [[Legia Warsaw]] fan and attends matches in Poland.&lt;ref name=icn070419/&gt;

On 21 April 2007, he helped a 27-year-old pregnant Polish woman, her sister and brother-in-law, when they were attacked in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=sm070422/&gt;

Boruc's father died in April 2010; his mother Jadwiga died when he was only 20. He has a brother and three sisters. On 11 June 2008, Boruc's then-wife Katarzyna gave birth to their son, Aleksander ("Aleks"), in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=dr080612/&gt; Boruc and his wife separated in 2008, amid reports of his relationship with former [[Idol (Polish TV series)|Polish Idol]] contestant Sara Mannei.&lt;ref name=dr081124/&gt; Mannei gave birth to daughter Amelia on 9 August 2010 in Poland and the couple married in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Sam|title=Bournemouth keeper Artur Boruc’s stunning wife Sara is the Cherry on top|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/67333/bournemouth-keeper-artur-borucs-stunning-wife-sara-is-the-cherry-on-top/|accessdate=20 August 2016|work=The Sun|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2009, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Scottish Sun]]'' newspaper published an apology, for claiming Boruc had had an affair with a young woman, shown in a photograph, who was actually his sister.&lt;ref name=tss090918/&gt; In June 2011, the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper admitted it had published a false report on Boruc, and paid him £70,000, believed to be a record for Scottish libel cases, plus legal expenses.&lt;ref name=guardian110619/&gt;

On 3 January 2012, Cook re-joined Bournemouth permanently for £150,000 signing a three-and-a-half-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10324~2564774,00.html | title=Cherries sign Cook on permanent basis | publisher=AFC Bournemouth | accessdate=3 January 2012 | date=3 January 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110104150/http://www.afcb.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10324~2564774,00.html | archivedate=10 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2016, he scored to equalise and then created the winning goal as Bournemouth completed one of the comebacks of the season to beat Liverpool for the first time in their history 4–3 in a sensational Premier League game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38121184|title=Bournemouth 4–3 Liverpool|date=4 December 2016|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Gosling''' (born 1 February 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]] as a [[midfielder|central midfielder]], [[midfielder|right midfielder]] or [[Fullback (association football)|right fullback]]. Gosling is a versatile player, having operated as a box-to-box midfielder on several occasions and occasionally deputised at right back to accommodate substitutions. His previous clubs are [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

==Club career==
===Plymouth Argyle===
Born in [[Brixham]], Devon, Gosling was spotted by [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] scouts when he was playing in the under-12 side of hometown club Brixham United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gosling ready for FA Cup final|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/Everton-s-Gosling-pride-Westcountry-FA-Cup-final/article-1035681-detail/article.html|newspaper=[[Western Morning News]]|date=30 May 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2006, at age 16 years and 310 days, he made his professional debut against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], coming on as a first-half substitute for injured Captain [[Paul Wotton]] and became the fourth youngest debutant. His full debut came on New Year's Day 2007, against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at [[Home Park]]. He proved his versatility in a solid performance, by moving from right-midfield to right-back after an early injury to defender [[Mathias Kouo-Doumbé]].

Gosling established himself as a regular in the reserve team, and his impressive performances were noticed by manager [[Ian Holloway]]. At the beginning of March 2007 he trained for a week with [[Premier League|Premiership]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/6407861.stm | title=Chelsea look at Argyle teenagers | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=18 July 2007 | date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with teammates [[Luke Summerfield]] and [[Scott Sinclair]]. That same year he was named The Herald's Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James hoping to see Gosling star in FA Cup|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/James-hoping-Gosling-star-FA-Cup/article-1032414-detail/article.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505122040/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/James-hoping-Gosling-star-FA-Cup/article-1032414-detail/article.html|dead-url=yes|archivedate=5 May 2013|newspaper=[[Cornish Guardian]]|date=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
In January 2008, Gosling signed a two and a half-year contract for [[Premier League]] team [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] from Plymouth, days after Everton's [[Lukas Jutkiewicz]] was loaned to the Pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/blues-confirm-gosling-deal.html | accessdate=3 January 2008 | publisher= Everton F.C. | title=Blues confirm Gosling deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first-team debut came in a 1–0 away victory against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7787565.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 December 2008|accessdate=9 February 2009|title=Middlesbrough 0–1 Everton|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first goal for the club came two days later in a 3–0 victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Goodison Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7788412.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 December 2008|accessdate=9 February 2009|title=Everton 3–0 Sunderland|first=Phil|last=McNulty }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, he was given a standing ovation by his own teammates in the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan Gosling earns standing ovation from team-mates after debut Everton goal|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2008/12/29/dan-gosling-earns-standing-ovation-from-team-mates-after-debut-everton-goal-100252-22564647/|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]|date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Gosling came on as a substitute and scored the only goal in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round replay at [[Goodison Park]] against crosstown rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the 118th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Everton 1–0 Liverpool (aet) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7861675.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Phil|last=McNulty|accessdate=4 February 2009 | date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An error by live broadcasters [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during the match meant the goal was missed by millions of TV viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/05/itv-fa-cup-coverage|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=ITV apologises after cameras miss only goal in Merseyside derby|first=Matt|last=Scott|date=5 February 2009|accessdate=9 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Gosling's mother Hilary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan Gosling's mother missed Everton goal due to ITV advertising blunder|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/4534229/Dan-Goslings-mother-missed-Everton-goal-due-to-ITV-advertising-blunder.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal scored against Liverpool was voted Everton's 'Goal of the Season' by the fans of the club. He went on to play in the [[2009 FA Cup Final]], coming on as a second-half substitute.

In the 2009–10 season, Gosling was mostly on the bench for league games, but was in the starting eleven for most of the [[2009-10 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Europa League]] matches. In March 2010, he ruptured his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] after a collision with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] goalkeeper [[Marcus Hahnemann]], and was ruled out of playing for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gosling out for nine months|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2011112,00.html|publisher=Premier League|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=1 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401203515/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~2011112%2C00.html|archivedate=1 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contract negotiations and exit====
Negotiations for a contract extension began in May 2009. Gosling declared ''"there's no other club I'd rather be at"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gosling set for new deal|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_5350257,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no extension was agreed and his contract with Everton expired on 30 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Andy|title=Dan Gosling's free agent move leaves Everton seething|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/07/dan-gosling-everton-free-agent|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=8 July 2010|date=7 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During contract negotiations Gosling was represented by [[David Hodgson (footballer)|David Hodgson]], a solicitor and former professional football player.

On 6 July 2010, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that the [[Professional Football Compensation Committee|PFCC tribunal]]'s decision allowed Gosling to leave Everton under the [[Bosman ruling]] with no compensation being paid by the club who sign the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton lose England U21 starlet for nothing after admin error|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/England-U21-starlet-Dan-Gosling-walks-out-of-Everton-for-nothing-after-amazing-admin-error-Exclusive-article517849.html|newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=6 July 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that the player earned £8,000 per week and had rejected a verbal offer of a £15,000 a week contract from Everton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan Gosling quits Everton|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1292869/Dan-Gosling-takes-flight-Everton-shock-starlet-eyes-West-Ham.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=8 July 2010 | location=London | first=John | last=Edwards | date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everton were required to submit a contract with better terms than the existing contract to Gosling before the 30 May deadline to enable the club to receive compensation from any English club interested in signing Gosling. The compensation amount has been reported as being as high as £4million.

The PFCC tribunal based their decision on Everton's contract offer being verbally arranged and not in writing: had the contract been in writing the Merseyside club would have been entitled to compensation should Gosling have moved to another English club (but not to a non-English club) as he is under 24 years of age. The tribunal's decision also meant that Gosling's previous club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] would receive no monetary amount despite a sell-on clause in Gosling's Everton contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryder|first=Lee|title=NUFC battle with Sunderland for Dan Gosling |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/newcastle-united/nufc-news/2010/07/08/nufc-battle-with-sunderland-for-dan-gosling-72703-26810849/|publisher=Chronicle Live|accessdate=8 July 2010|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the playing contract expired Everton and Plymouth are also no longer entitled to [[Solidarity Contribution (football)|solidarity contributions]] despite the player being registered with the clubs before he turned 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOLIDARITY MECHANISM|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/06/30/78/statusinhalt_en_122007.pdf|work=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=8 July 2010|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season Plymouth went into administration.

===Newcastle United===
On 22 July 2010, Gosling signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8844933.stm|title=Dan Gosling signs four-year deal with Newcastle|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made only one appearance in his first season for the club, because of a continuing problem with his knee, resulting in surgery in February 2011. From then on, he only made substitute appearances due to the prominent pairing of [[Cheick Tioté]] and [[Yohan Cabaye]]. Following Cabaye's departure in January 2014, he began to be used more regularly until the end of the season. His only goal for the club came in a 3–1 defeat to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 19 November 2011, which ended the Magpies' unbeaten start to the 2011–12 season.

On 22 April, Aké started alongside [[David Luiz]] and [[César Azpilicueta]] in central defence in Chelsea's 4–2 FA Cup semi-final victory over rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39604653 |title=Chelsea 4–2 Tottenham |date=22 April 2017 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 June 2017, Aké signed a contract with Premier League club AFC Bournemouth on a permanent basis for a club record of £20&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee, with the player officially re-joining the club the following day, when the 2017 transfer window opened.&lt;ref name="BBC_30Jun2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nathan Ake: Bournemouth sign Chelsea defender for a club record fee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40454293 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=30 June 2017 |date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July, it was reported his former club Chelsea had inserted a buy-back clause for Aké in his transfer contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4068567/buy-back-clause-chelsea-nathan-ake-nathaniel-chalobah-bertrand-traore/ |title=What is a buy-back clause? And have Chelsea inserted them in Nathan Ake, Nathaniel Chalobah and Bertrand Traore deals? |work=The Sun |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=21 July 2017 |last=Street |first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Aké has represented the Netherlands at every youth level since his under-15 debut in 2009, making 54 appearances in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/nathan-ake/182930/ |title=N. AKÉ |publisher=Soccerway |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has captained both the U17 and the U19 sides. Aké was selected into both squads that won the UEFA European Under-17 Championships in 2011 and 2012 in Serbia and in Slovenia, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1796817.html |title=Captain Aké learns from Chelsea stars |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké was also eligible to represent the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] through his father Moise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2017/05/02/35150672/chelsea-star-ake-could-snub-netherlands-for-ivory-coast |title=Chelsea star Ake could snub Netherlands for Ivory Coast |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké made his senior international debut in a friendly against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], which the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] won 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4560108/Morocco-1-2-Holland-Vincent-Janssen-seals-friendly-win.html |title=Ake makes Holland Debut in Friendly |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Aké has been praised for his versatility, being able to play at both full back, centre back and in defensive midfield, which has been attributed to a good work ethic, professionalism and gifted technique. His calmness on the ball and appearance have led to comparisons to former Dutch legend and Chelsea player [[Ruud Gullit]], with his versatility compared to David Luiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2278552/Chelsea-youth-player-Nathan-Ake-looks-like-Ruud-Gullit-plays-like-David-Luiz.html |title=Ruud boy: Chelsea youth star Ake is a mini Gullit with his dreadlocks and cool head |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aké said that even though he has played as a defender in recent seasons, he sees himself as a holding midfielder and that his favourite position is in the midfield.&lt;ref name="dailystar1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Aké's father is from the Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/15/nathan-ake-watford-jose-mourinho-chelsea? |title=Nathan Aké on Watford, Mourinho and the Chelsea loanees’ WhatsApp group |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2017/05/near-and-far--nathan-ake1.html |title=Near and Far: Nathan Ake |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is teetotal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/30/premier-league-2018-19-preview-bournemouth |title=Premier League 2018–19 preview No 2: Bournemouth |first=Ben |last=Fisher |date=30 July 2018 |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surman was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa,&lt;ref name="Hugman1011" /&gt; where his parents had moved to from Britain, whilst his father worked for an insurance company. His parents returned to the city of [[Southampton]] in 1995, and he joined Tyro League club [[Hedge End]] Rangers, where he was spotted by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] club scouts and invited to join the [[Southampton F.C. Academy|Saints academy]]. He attended St. Mary's College in Bitterne and captained the football team.

===Southampton===
Surman was the youngest player ever to play for the Saints Reserves until [[Theo Walcott]] took his record. He scored on his league debut when on loan to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] during the 2004–05 season, and, when he rejoined ''the Saints'' at the beginning of the 2005–06 season, he performed well on their pre-season tour of Scotland. He then enjoyed a successful loan spell with [[AFC Bournemouth]] between August 2005 and January 2006, playing in every league match for the team, and scoring six goals. He might have figured in Southampton's [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], but was cup-tied, having played earlier in the season for Bournemouth against [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]].

Surman made his full team debut for Southampton on 25 January 2006 under new manager [[George Burley]] at home to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], and in the next league match scored his first Southampton goal in a 2–1 defeat against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. On 17 February 2007, he scored a [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] (two strikes from outside the penalty box and a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]) in the 5–2 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]].

He became a vital part of the Southampton first team over the [[2006–07 Southampton F.C. season|2006–07 season]], and was a part of their unsuccessful play-off bid, losing on penalties to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] after a 4–4 aggregate draw, where his great strike was not enough to take ''Saints'' to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Surman joined newly promoted [[Premier League]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a three-year deal, plus another year's option, for a fee worth around £1.2&amp;nbsp;million on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman swoop secured for Wolvs|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/2009/07/01/surman-swoop-secured-for-wolves/|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=Express &amp; Star|date=1 July 2009|location=Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8128420.stm|title= Midfielder Surman moves to Wolves |date=1 July 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate= 1 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090702012318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8128420.stm| archivedate= 2 July 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his move to Wolves, Surman expressed his sadness of leaving Southampton and described the club's plight as "unbelievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saints struggles sadden Surman|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11699/5410584/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 July 2009|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surman made his debut on 18 August 2009 against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], coming on for [[Greg Halford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10307~49196,00.html |title=Wigan Athletic 0–1 Wolves |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |accessdate=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824151345/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10307~49196%2C00.html |archivedate=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first Premier League start on 21 November 2009 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], but struggled to hold down a first team place, making just nine appearances in total for the club.

===Norwich City===
Surman signed for newly promoted [[EFL Championship|Championship]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 22 June 2010 in a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norwich City swoop for Wolves' Andrew Surman |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/8754639.stm |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 6 August 2010 in the 3–2 defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Carrow Road]]. After an impressive start to his Norwich City career, he sustained a knee injury in training, two days before the 2–1 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 11 September 2010. He returned to action against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 20 November in a 1–1 draw. He was subbed on 60 minutes. He suffered a re-occurrence of the injury in the 4–1 victory over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] which sidelined him until February 2011. To improve his fitness, Surman played 65 minutes in the Norfolk Senior Cup match against Dereham. He made three appearances off the bench for the first team before making his first start in the 2–0 victory over Barnsley, playing the full 90 minutes. He scored his first goal for Norwich in a 3–1 win against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. On 15 April 2011, Surman scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The following week, Surman scored the opener in the 5–1 win over Ipswich at [[Portman Road]] on 21 April 2011. At the end of the season, Norwich City was promoted to the Premier League after a six-year absent.

Surman played in three out of the opening four Premier League fixtures before losing his place, with manager [[Paul Lambert]] choosing to play a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Surman as an unused substitute, before returning to the starting line-up at the end of November. On 20 December 2011, he scored the opening goal against Wolves with a header in a 2–2 draw. On 14 January 2012, he scored the opening goal against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] with a left-footed shot in a 2–1 win. On 4 February, he scored the opening goal against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] with a right-footed shot in a 2–0 win. Surman believes that making more appearances in the Premier League is making him produce the best performances of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman delights in form|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7523359/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2012, he scored the only goal in the match for Norwich in a 6–1 defeat by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norwich 1–6 Manchester |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17642962 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Surman said that the defeat to Manchester City would turn things around to winning ways for Norwich by the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Surman&amp;nbsp;– Loss will motivate us |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7683144/ |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Norwich survived in the Premier League, Surman signed a new three-year deal which will keep him at the club until 2015, saying, "It feels great. It's an honour for me to sign another contract at Norwich City. I've really enjoyed my time here and I'm looking forward to another three years at the club, It has been amazing. Everyone keeps talking about these last three years at the club, winning two promotions and then staying in the Premier League."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman pens Canaries deal |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/7830608/Surman-pens-Canaries-deal|publisher=Sky Sports|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After starting the new season in the team, Surman was ruled out of first team action from October until the New Year after suffering a knee injury in training.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===AFC Bournemouth===
[[File:Andrew Surman 15-10-2016 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Surman playing for [[AFC Bournemouth]] in 2016]]

On 31 July 2013, Bournemouth completed the signing of Surman on a one-year loan deal. Surman played a vital role in Bournemouth's first team in the [[2013–14 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2013–14 season]], making 35 appearances for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norwich City's Andrew Surman joins Bournemouth on loan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23525067 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2014, he completed a permanent move to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norwich's Andrew Surman to Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29021180|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2015, Surman was part of the Bournemouth team which won the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|Championship title]] and promotion to the Premier League.&lt;ref name=Champions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759|title=Charlton 0 Bournemouth 3|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 May 2015 |accessdate =3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2017, Surman was sent off for two bookable offences in a 1–1 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the second being for a push on [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] after the latter had elbowed [[Tyrone Mings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United 1 Bournemouth 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39086674|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2017, he scored his first Premier League goal for Bournemouth in 64 Premier League appearances, in a 2–1 victory against Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bournemouth 2 Brighton 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41196761|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=15 September 2017|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Although qualified to play for [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Lisa |title=Wolves: Andrew Surman back to his African roots for 2010 World Cup |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/midlands-sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/wolverhampton-wanderers-news/2009/10/11/wolves-andrew-surman-back-to-his-african-roots-for-2010-world-cup-66331-24899442/ |work=Sunday Mercury |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was selected for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 national team]] for the European Championship qualifiers away to [[Montenegro national under-21 football team|Montenegro]] on 7 September and [[Bulgaria national under-21 football team|Bulgaria]] on 11 September. In the match against Montenegro, he came on as a second-half substitute and scored the final goal in a 3–0 victory, tapping the ball home in stoppage time from a knock-down by former Saints' trainee [[Dexter Blackstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 September 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6984539.stm |title=Montenegro U21 0–3 England U21 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Surman said that he had been "approached" to see if he was interested to play for South Africa. Though he declined, he said it was a "great honour to be approached". He went on to say that he has put any international ambitions "on the back burner" as he needs to concentrate fully on club matters and his family. He explained that "it would be a lot, especially with the [[African Nations Cup]], to be travelling around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surman not rushing but still considering South Africa call |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2199190/Andrew-Surman-open-South-Africa-call.html |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=6 September 2012 |date=6 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, he told the Daily Echo: "I have never ruled out playing for South Africa but my priority has always been my club football. The past two or three years have been hugely important for me. If I had gone to play international football things might not have worked out the same way. I was really honoured to be called up and it certainly was not something I turned up my nose at. I really, seriously, considered it. But I have a young family and international football is a big commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Saint Andrew Surman not ruling out playing for South Africa|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/15389452.Ex_Saint_not_ruling_out_playing_for_South_Africa/|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=Daily Echo|date=4 July 2017|location=Southampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In April 2015, Surman's wife gave birth to the couple's third child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Surman: Bournemouth star 'proud' after whirlwind week|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32285640|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 July 2017|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

== Early life ==
Daniels was born October 28, 1936, in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], and raised on a musical diet that included Pentecostal gospel, local bluegrass bands, and the rhythm &amp; blues and country music from Nashville's 50,000-watt radio stations [[WLAC]] and [[WSM (AM)]]. In 2016, he shared memories of his youth and baseball in Wilmington when he wrote the foreword for a book on the [[Tobacco State League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tobacco State League; A North Carolina Baseball History, 1946–1950|author-last=Holaday|author-first=Chris|publisher=McFarland|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4766-6670-9|location=Jefferson, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, Daniels moved to the small town of [[Gulf, North Carolina|Gulf, Chatham County, North Carolina]]. He graduated from high school in 1955. Already skilled on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, he formed a rock 'n' roll band and hit the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/daniels_charlie/bio.jhtml|title=Charlie Daniels Biography|work=[[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]|accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1964, Daniels co-wrote "It Hurts Me" (a song which [[Elvis Presley]] recorded) with his friend, producer [[Bob Johnston]], under Bob's wife's name, Joy Byers.&lt;!-- Simmons, Sylvie (2012). I’m Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen. Random House LLC. ISBN 9780771080425. --&gt; He worked as a Nashville [[session musician]], often for Johnston, including playing guitar and electric bass on three [[Bob Dylan]] albums during 1969 and 1970, and on recordings by [[Leonard Cohen]]. Daniels recorded his first solo album, ''Charlie Daniels'', in 1971 (see [[1971 in country music]]). He also produced the 1969 album by [[the Youngbloods]], ''[[Elephant Mountain]]''.

His first hit, the [[novelty song]] "[[Uneasy Rider]]", was from his 1973 third album, ''Honey in the Rock'', and reached No.9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:CharlieDaniels265-1000.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Daniels in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in [[Santa Ynez, California]]]]
During this period, Daniels played fiddle on many of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]]'s early albums: "A New Life", "Where We All Belong", "Searchin' For a Rainbow", "Long Hard Ride" and "Carolina Dreams". Daniels can be heard on the live portion of the "Where We All Belong" album, recorded in Milwaukee on July 31, 1974.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The same year, he organized the first in a series of [[Volunteer Jam]] concerts based in or around [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, often playing with members of [[Barefoot Jerry]]. Except for a three-year gap in the late 1980s, the Jams continued until 1996. In 1999, the first of several Volunteer Jam Tours began, and in 2015, a Jam celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first Volunteer Jam was held at [[Bridgestone Arena]], and another followed in 2016 celebrating his 80th birthday. In 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band with the [[Southern rock]] self-identification anthem "The South's Gonna Do It Again". "[[Long Haired Country Boy]]" was a minor hit in that year. Daniels played fiddle on [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s 1975 album ''[[Hank Williams, Jr. and Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class= album | id=hank-williams-jr-friends-mca-special-products-mw0000313538 |tab=credits |label=''Hank Williams, Jr. &amp; Friends'' |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance]] in 1979 for "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in September 1979.  The following year, "Devil" became a major crossover success on rock radio stations after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the hit movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', in which he made an onscreen appearance. The song still receives regular airplay on U.S. classic rock and country stations. A [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[cover version]] of the song was included in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' as the final [[guitar battle]] against the last boss (Lou, the [[devil]]).  Daniels has openly stated his opposition to the metal cover and the devil winning occasionally in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2008/soapbox-2008-040408.htm |title=Charlie Daniels Profile |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003070904/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2008/soapbox-2008-040408.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Daniels pop hits included "[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]" (#11 in 1980), "[[The Legend of Wooley Swamp]]" (#31 in 1980), and "[[Still in Saigon]]" (#22 in 1982).  In 1980, Daniels participated in the country music concept album, ''[[The Legend of Jesse James]]''. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several of Daniels' albums and singles were hits on the [[country music|Country]] charts and the music continues to receive airplay on country stations today.  Daniels released several [[gospel music|Gospel]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] records.  In 1999, he made a guest vocal appearance on his song "All Night Long" with Montgomery Gentry (Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry) for their debut album, "Tattoos and Scars," which was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandnote.com/people.php?keyword=montgomery+gentry&amp;scode=timeline&amp;submit=Go&amp;page=3|title=RolandNotes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels' distinctive speaking voice was used in [[Frank Wildhorn]]'s 1999 musical, ''[[The Civil War (musical)|The Civil War]]''. He is featured in the Prologue and "In Great Deeds". Daniels was inducted into the [[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Inductees|url=http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/category/inductees/1999-inductees|work=[[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Daniels' songwriting has garnered 6 BMI Country Awards; the first award was won in 1976 for "The South's Gonna Do It Again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/534313 |title=Charlie Daniels Named BMI Icon at 53rd Annual Country Awards |work=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] |date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels now resides in [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee]], where the city has named a park after him. He continues to tour regularly. He appeared in commercials for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in 2002 with other celebrities convincing [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Jarrett]] to race the UPS Truck.

[[Joel DiGregorio|William Joel "Taz" DiGregorio]], Daniels' keyboardist, died in a car accident in Cheatham County, Tennessee, on October 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlie-daniels-joel-taz-digregorio-dies-248314 |title=Charlie Daniels Original Joel 'Taz' DiGregorio Dies In Crash |first=Erik |last=Pedersen |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=13 October 2011 |issn=0018-3660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Charlie Daniels at NavSta Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003]]
Daniels' public politics have been varied and idiosyncratic, tending toward in his late career a general [[American conservatism|rightward]] progression. His earliest hit, "Uneasy Rider," portrayed him as a country boy in the counterculture movement, caught in an argument with right-wingers at a "redneck" bar. "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[President of the United States|presidential]] bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=M.C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |date=1996 |publisher=Canongate Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0862416043 |page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]" was a reaction to the 1979–1981 [[Iran Hostage Crisis]] and the troubled American economy of the later 1970s; despite the turmoil the song described a patriotic, united America where "we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank/That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks." The song experienced a revival following the [[September 11 attacks]], when it was floated around the internet as "F*** [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]".

In 1989, Daniels' country hit "Simple Man" was interpreted by some as advocating [[vigilantism]]. Lyrics such as "Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest," garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.

In 2003, Daniels published an ''Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch'' in defense of President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] policy. His 2003 book ''Ain't No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag'' contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize [[John Kerry]]'s service record but that Kerry should allow the release of his official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409190807/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html |archivedate=2005-04-09 |title=Zell Miller |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |date=April 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His band's official website contains a "soapbox" page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soap-box|title=Soap Box|last=|first=|date=|work=The Charlie Daniels Band|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Daniels has made statements such as the following: "In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory" and "I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists" regarding [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]]. On March 27, 2009, Daniels criticized the [[Obama Administration]] for "changing the name of the War on Terror to the "[[War on Terror|Overseas Contingency Operation]]" and referring to terrorism as "man-caused disasters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's Finally Happened |work=The Charlie Daniels Band |date=March 27, 2009 |url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2009/soapbox-2009-0327.htm |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403081913/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2009/soapbox-2009-0327.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Daniels lambasted [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] for signing the [[Reproductive Health Act]], which legalized abortion until birth under some circumstances, [[Twitter|tweeting]], "Watch the wrinkles on Cuomo’s face lengthen as the ramifications of the thousands of murders he has sanctioned come to bear on him. The [[New York General Assembly|NY legislature]] has created a new [[Auschwitz]] dedicated to the execution of a whole segment of defenseless citizens. [[Satan]] is smiling."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-music-legend-charlie-daniels-blasts-new-york-gov-for-new-abortion-law Music legend Charlie Daniels blasts NY's Dem governor over new abortion law: 'Satan is smiling'] (Fox News)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Daniels enjoys hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and other outdoor activities. He is a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). He married his wife, Hazel, on September 20, 1964. Together, they have one son, Charlie Daniels, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/bio|title=Charlie Daniels Biography|last=|first=|date=|work=The Charlie Daniels Band|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980, while digging fence post holes on his farm near Mount Juliet, where he lives. He suffered three complete breaks in his right arm, and two broken fingers when his shirtsleeve caught on a spinning auger. The injury required surgery, and sidelined him for four months.&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 1"&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=January 30, 1980 |title=Country-Rock Singer Charlie Daniels Hurt In Farm Accident |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pp5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2784%2C5419318 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Daniels on his medical recovery: 'Doctors treat and God heals'|url=http://www.today.com/health/charlie-daniels-his-medical-recovery-doctors-treat-god-heals-2D79468130 |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels was successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2001.&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 2"/&gt; On January 15, 2010, Daniels was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke while snowmobiling in Colorado. He recovered and was released two days later.&lt;ref name="Charlie injury 2"/&gt;

During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of [[pneumonia]] and admitted to a [[Nashville]] hospital for a series of routine tests. The tests revealed that a [[pacemaker]] was needed to regulate his heart rate. One was put in on March 28 and Daniels was released from hospital within days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charlie Daniels gets a pacemaker |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/03/28/charlie-daniels-has-successful-pacemaker-surgery/2028961 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of [[absolute advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/what-is-absolute-advantage/|title=Absolute Advantage – Ability to Produce More than Anyone Else|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot [[John Snell]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

Smith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of [[William Hogarth]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ "100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"]. Retrieved 31 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the County of [[Fife]], Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]] (senior [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]]), [[Advocate#Scotland|advocate]] and [[Prosecutor#Scotland|prosecutor]] (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Smith's baptism into the [[Church of Scotland]] at Kirkcaldy was &lt;!-- 5 June is OS; 5 June is NS. --&gt;5 June 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth,&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.{{efn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes: "In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy."&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;}} Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from 1729 to 1737, he learned [[Latin]], mathematics, history, and writing.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt;

===Formal education===

Smith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt; Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;

Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W.&amp;nbsp;R. "The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&amp;nbsp;R. Scott," ''Econ Journal Watch 8(1):'' 96–109, January 2011.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-never-to-be-forgotten-hutcheson-excerpts-from-wr-scott]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Smith's mother.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Portrait of Smith's mother, Margaret Douglas]]

===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture topics included [[rhetoric]] and ''[[belles-lettres]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. ([1762] 1985). ''Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres'' [1762]. vol. IV of the Glasgow Edition of the ''Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1984). Retrieved 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]". While Smith was not adept at [[public speaking]], his lectures met with success.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43" /&gt; He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".&lt;ref name="rae 1895 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.

Following the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow – Archive Services – Exhibitions – Adam Smith in Glasgow – Photo Gallery – Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring and travels===
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse]], France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]] was a friend and contemporary of Smith's.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met [[Benjamin Franklin]], and discovered the [[Physiocracy]] school founded by [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiocrats were opposed to [[mercantilism]], the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto ''[[Laissez-faire|Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!]]'' (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]{{efn|During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]], the population shrunk by 4 million and agricultural productivity was reduced by one-third while the taxes had increased.

The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that "with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2b, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic ''classe steril''—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended [[Henry Moyes]], a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude.  Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a member of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]] in 1775. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=The Story of Civilization: Rousseau and Revolution|date=1 July 1967|publisher=MJF Books|ISBN=1567310214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Panmure House (Edinburgh)|Panmure House]] in Edinburgh's [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Kirkcaldy High Street Adam Smith Plaque.png|thumb|upright|right|A commemorative plaque for Smith is located in Smith's home town of [[Kirkcaldy]].|alt=A plaque of Smith]]
Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the [[Canongate Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist [[Joseph Black]] and the pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as ''[[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]]''.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"/&gt;

Smith's library went by his will to [[David Douglas, Lord Reston]] (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter= Adam Smith's Will |title=A Catalogue of the Library of Adam Smith |editor=Bonar, James |editor-link= James Bonar (civil servant) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1894 |pages= XIV |oclc=2320634 |url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueoflibr00smit#page/n19/mode/2up |ref=harv |via=Internet Archive}}|accessdate= 13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Bannerman). On the death in 1878 of her husband, the Reverend W.&amp;nbsp;B. Cunningham of Prestonpans, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor [[Robert Oliver Cunningham]] of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

==Personality and beliefs==

===Character===
[[File:Smith medallion portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[James Tassie]]'s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|pp=xx–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a man's head facing the right]]

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88" /&gt; He never married,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to talk to himself,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Skousen|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt; According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] factory, and while discussing [[free trade]], Smith walked into a huge [[Tanning (leather)|tanning pit]] from which he needed help to escape.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14" /&gt;

[[James Boswell]], who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the [[The Club (Literary Club)|Literary Club]], says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], that "he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood".&lt;ref&gt;Boswell's '[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith1790b.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Smith by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], 1790|alt=A drawing of a man standing up, with one hand holding a cane and the other pointing at a book]]

Smith has been alternatively described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable".&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2010|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt; Smith rarely sat for portraits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Dugald |title=The Works of Adam Smith: With An Account of His Life and Writings |publisher=Henry G. Bohn |location=London |year=1853 |page=lxix |oclc=3226570 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbYCAAAAYAAJ |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by [[James Tassie]] and two [[etching]]s by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=376–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of ''The Wealth of Nations'' were based largely on Tassie's medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Times obituary of Adam Smith|journal=[[The Times]]|date=24 July 1790|pages=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1790/Obituary/Adam_Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-American economist [[Ronald Coase]] has challenged the view that Smith was a [[deist]], based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds.&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|pp=529–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]", later scholars such as [[Jacob Viner]] have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God",&lt;ref name="Coase-God"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the ''Wealth of Nations'' in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".&lt;ref name="Coase-God" /&gt;

Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.&lt;ref name="hidden theology"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=L. |doi=10.1080/713765225 |title=The hidden theology of Adam Smith |journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=8 |pages=1–29 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was also a close friend of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="hume on religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric Schliesser |year=2003 |journal=Hume Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=327–62 |title=The Obituary of a Vain Philosopher: Adam Smith's Reflections on Hume's Life |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v29n2/schliesser/schliesser-v29n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==

===''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''===
{{Main|The Theory of Moral Sentiments}}
In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' sold by co-publishers [[Andrew Millar]] of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/|title=Andrew Millar Project, University of Edinburgh|website=millar-project.ed.ac.uk|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death.{{efn|The 6 editions of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments [1759]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although ''The Wealth of Nations'' is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself is believed to have considered ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' to be a superior work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]] |year=1997 |author=Falkner, Robert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611110312/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |archivedate=11 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jonathan B. ''Saving Adam Smith''. Upper Saddle River: Prentic-Hall, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel. ''A History of Economic Thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brue, Stanley L., and Randy R. Grant. ''The Evolution of Economic Thought''. Mason: Thomson Higher Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.&lt;ref&gt;Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Ekelund|Ekelund]] and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund, R. &amp; Hebert, R. 2007, ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'' 5th Edition. Waveland Press, United States, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wealth of Nations''===
{{Main|The Wealth of Nations}}

Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book&amp;nbsp;IV, Chapter&amp;nbsp;II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Smith used the term "[[invisible hand|the invisible hand]]" in "History of Astronomy"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1980, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 3, p. 49, edited by W.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;D. Wightman and J.&amp;nbsp;C. Bryce, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter", and once in each of his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 1, pp. 184–85, edited by D.&amp;nbsp;D. Raphael and A.&amp;nbsp;L. Macfie, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1759) and [[The Wealth of Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456, edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Cambell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.

[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:&lt;blockquote&gt;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]
Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] – [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."

Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith added that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and dissent===
[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: "the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there."&lt;ref&gt;''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===In economics and moral philosophy===
''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith" /&gt;

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.&lt;ref&gt;L.Seabrooke (2006). "Global Standards of Market Civilization". p. 192. Taylor &amp; Francis 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George&amp;nbsp;J. (1976). "The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 84(6), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 pp. 1199]–213, 1202. Also published as Selected Papers, No. 50 [http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:hs0XwYbafSgJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 (PDF)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modelling of [[Walras]] a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], and [[Karl Marx]] in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul A. (1977). "A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith," ''American Economic Review'', 67(1), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). "Marxian Value Analysis". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). "Marx, Karl Heinrich", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "[[political economy]]" used by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jevons, W. Stanley |year=1879 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#PPR3,M1 |title=The Theory of Political Economy |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). "Marginalist Economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&amp;Levy,%20final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In British Imperial debates===
Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Benians, ‘Adam Smith’s project of an empire’, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846–1946'' (Oxford, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith's theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9159669&amp;fileId=S0018246X13000101 “Adam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870–1932,”] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]] in London, multiple entities known as the "Adam Smith Society", including an historical Italian organization,&lt;ref name="urlThe Adam Smith Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721032612/http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archivedate=21 July 2007 |title=The Adam Smith Society |accessdate=24 May 2008 |publisher=The Adam Smith Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S.-based [[Adam Smith Society]],&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choi|first1=Amy|title=Defying Skeptics, Some Business Schools Double Down on Capitalism|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-04/defying-skeptics-some-business-schools-double-down-on-capitalism|accessdate=24 February 2015|publisher=''[[Bloomberg Business News]]''|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who We Are"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adamsmithsociety.com/html/our-history.html|title=Who We Are: The Adam Smith Society|access-date=February 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Adam Smith Club,&lt;ref name="urlThe Australian Adam Smith Club"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmithclub.org/ |title=The Australian Adam Smith Club |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Adam Smith Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3748 |title=Interview with Milton Friedman |last=Levy |first=David |date=June 1992 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that, while Smith did not coin the term ''[[laissez-faire]]'', "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that ''The Wealth of Nations'' was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".&lt;ref name="urlFRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |title=FRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080427/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.J. O'Rourke]] describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".&lt;ref name="urlAdam Smith: Web Junkie – Forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |title=Adam Smith: Web Junkie |work=Forbes |accessdate=10 June 2008 |date=5 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520232632/http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers have argued that Smith's support for ''laissez-faire'' (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. [[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]".&lt;ref name="Brown93"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–32 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&lt;ref name="Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).

[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref name="Viner 1927"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358–72 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113–80 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"&gt;Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"/&gt;

Some have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Christopher. "Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795–96," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110–25, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96]&lt;/ref&gt; although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Joshua King''' (16 January 1798 – 1 September 1857) was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1839 to 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KN814J|name=King, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the President of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], from 1832 until his death and [[Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University]] from 1833–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/about-the-college/college-facts/fellows-and-presidents/fellows-1800-1899|title=Fellows 1800 – 1899|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Educated at [[Hawkshead Grammar School]], Joshua King went first to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1815 but moved to [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]] in February 1816 as a sizar (i.e. a student receiving some financial assistance), and graduated [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1819.

==Career==
He was elected a Fellow of the [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens’]] in 1820, and served as its President from 1832 to his death – the first person not in holy orders to be so elected. In the University, he was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] from 1839, resigning because of ill-health in 1849 having given no lectures and published only one paper. His interests seemingly shifted from mathematics to law and politics, although he declined to stand as [[Tory]] candidate for Parliament for either the town or the University. He served on many committees, and was Vice-Chancellor in 1833/34. He died on 1 September 1857 aged 59, and was buried in the antechapel of the College.

:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Joshua King came to Cambridge from [[Hawkshead Grammar School]]. It was soon evident that the school had produced someone of importance. He became [[Senior Wrangler]], and his reputation in Cambridge was immense. It was believed that nothing less than a second [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] had appeared. They expected his work as a mathematician to make an epoch in the science. At an early age he became president of [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens’]]; later, he was Lucasian Professor. He published nothing; in fact, he did no mathematical work. But as long as he kept his health, he was an active and prominent figure in Cambridge, and he maintained his enormous reputation. When he died, it was felt that the memory of such an extraordinary man should not be permitted to die out, and his papers should be published. So his papers were examined, and nothing whatever worth publishing was found."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/page-510 Queens' College Record 2004]

He also scored a brace in West Ham's 3–1 [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] [[2009–10 Football League Cup|second round]] victory over arch-rivals [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in August 2009. The first goal came three minutes from time before scoring a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] winner in [[extra time]]. However, the game was marred by the [[2009 Upton Park riot]] which included pitch invasions after both of Stanislas' goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8205836.stm|title=West Ham 3–1 Millwall|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal of the season came on 4 October 2009, when he came off the bench to score a last minute equaliser in a 2–2 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; His final goal of the season was on 28 November 2009, scoring the second goal in a 5–3 win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; He remained a first-team player until the end of the season featuring heavily in the run-in as West Ham secured their Premier League safety. Stanislas made a total of 28 appearances in all competitions, scoring 4 goals in the [[2009–10 West Ham United F.C. season|2009–10]] season.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt;

In the summer of 2010, [[Gianfranco Zola]] was replaced by [[Avram Grant]] as manager and Stanislas found himself down the pecking order at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. His first appearance of the season was on 24 August 2010, in a 1–0 win over [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the League Cup.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; He had a prolonged spell in the first team during November and December, making 5 appearances.

In January 2011, he was ruled out until the end of the season after undergoing hernia surgery.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt; After four months out, he made his comeback for the reserves on 11 May, playing 30 minutes in a 3–2 defeat to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110511/stanislas-returns-for-reserves_2236884_2358060|title=Stanislas returns for reserves|publisher=West Ham United F.C.|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=2012-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827130855/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20110511/stanislas-returns-for-reserves_2236884_2358060|archivedate=27 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a total of 8 appearances in all competitions, scoring 1 goal in the [[2010–11 West Ham United F.C. season|2010–11]] season as West Ham were relegated to the Championship.&lt;ref name="Player profile Junior Stanislas"/&gt;

The summer again brought a change of manager with [[Sam Allardyce]] replacing the departed Avram Grant. His first game of the season was in the league game against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] on 13 August 2011, coming on as a late substitute for [[Herita Ilunga]] in a 1–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14429582 |title=Doncaster 0–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC sport |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2011, he scored his first goal of the season in what proved to be his final appearance for the Hammers, in their 2–1 League Cup defeat to [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14569566.stm|title=West Ham 1–2 Aldershot|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

== Style of play ==
Primarily deployed as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] on the left flank, Fraser is a right-footed player described by his compatriot [[Charlie Nicholas]] as an "old-fashioned type of player" and a "little pocket dynamo" for the muscly physique he has developed to "take the knocks and kicks that come his way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/11513575/ryan-fraser-is-now-fulfilling-his-potential-at-bournemouth|title=Ryan Fraser is now fulfilling his potential at Bournemouth|last=Bate|first=Adam|date=1 October 2018|website=Sky Sports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser has also occasionally played in the right-back position for both club and country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/cherries/clubnews/16132817.Winger_Ryan_Fraser_admits_filling_in_at_right_back_can_be_a_tall_order/|title=Winger Ryan Fraser admits filling in at right-back can be a tall order|last=|first=|date=3 April 2018|website=Bournemouth Echo|publisher=Bournemouth Echo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, he joined Premier League champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a fee of £8 million, remaining second-choice until his move to Bournemouth two years later.

Begović represented [[Canada national football team|Canada]] at youth level playing for them at the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

He soon established himself as their number one goalkeeper and helped them qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], their first major tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Begović was born in [[Trebinje]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was at the time part of Yugoslavia, to a [[Bosniak]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asmir's world settled at last|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Lankhof/2007/07/01/4305227-sun.html|publisher=Sun Media Corp.|author=Bill Lankhof|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Amir, was also a goalkeeper who played for [[FK Leotar|Leotar]] and [[NK Iskra Bugojno|Iskra Bugojno]] whilst his mother, Ajnija, hails from [[Stolac]]. The Begović family fled the [[Bosnian War]] to Germany when Asmir was four years old, where he began to play organised football with local youth club FC Kirchhausen in [[Heilbronn]]. When he was 10, his family moved to [[Edmonton]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir and Nicolle Begovic: 'I think we've found the perfect match'|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Asmir-Nicolle-Begovic-think-ve-perfect-match/story-13745097-detail/story.html|work=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea===
[[File:Chelsea Vs Maccabi Tel-Aviv (20870322584).jpg|thumb|upright|Begović playing for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2015]]

On 13 July 2015, Chelsea signed Begović on a four-year deal for a fee of £8 million. As part of the deal Chelsea also offered midfielder [[Marco van Ginkel]] in part exchange to Stoke on loan for one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begovic transfer completed|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2015/07/begovic-transfer-completed.html|publisher=chelseafc.com|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33270636|title=Asmir Begovic: Chelsea sign goalkeeper from Stoke City|publisher=bbc.com|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2518524/chelsea-offer-van-ginkel-in-new-asmir-begovic-bid-sources|title=Chelsea offer Van Ginkel to Stoke in new Asmir Begovic bid|publisher=espnfc.com|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut nine days later on Chelsea's pre-season tour, coming on at half time for [[Thibaut Courtois]] with Chelsea 1–0 up against the [[New York Red Bulls]], but the match ended in a 2–4 defeat. Manager [[José Mourinho]] defended Begović's performance, attributing it to fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Draper|first1=Rob|title=Jose Mourinho defends £8m keeper Asmir Begovic after debut errors as Chelsea are beaten by New York Red Bulls|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3171708/Jose-Mourinho-defends-8m-keeper-Asmir-Begovic-debut-errors-Chelsea-beaten-New-York-Red-Bulls.html|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first competitive fixture was the [[2015 FA Community Shield]] on 2 August at [[Wembley Stadium]], in which he was unused in a 1–0 loss to [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cryer|first1=Andy|title=Arsenal 1–0 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33667216|accessdate=2 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later he came on as a substitute for [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] when Courtois was sent off for conceding a penalty with a foul on [[Bafétimbi Gomis]], who converted it for a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Neil|title=Chelsea 2–2 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33744668|accessdate=8 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August, Begović made his first competitive start for Chelsea in a 3–0 away loss to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester City 3–0 Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33839794|accessdate=16 August 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he earned the first clean sheet of the season for Chelsea in a [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] which ended in a 4–0 win for Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea 4–0 Maccabi Tel Aviv|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34203636|accessdate=16 September 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept a sequence of three clean sheets before Courtois returned to the team on 5 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea 0–1 Bournemouth: Late Murray winner stuns Blues|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/match/chelsea-vs-afc-bournemouth/2043202/report|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher=goal.com|date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season with Chelsea, Begović didn't get much playing time, and there were speculations that he would leave the club in the winter transfer window. However, since Chelsea couldn't find a replacement for him, he was forced to stay at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scsport.ba/begovic-nervira-me-sto-ne-dobijam-dovoljno-prilika/|title=Begović: Nervira me što ne dobijam dovoljno prilika|website=scsport.ba|date=7 February 2017|accessdate=23 February 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of featuring in only two league games, he received a winners' medal as Chelsea won the [[2016–17 Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/10879368/chelsea-confirm-asmir-begovic-will-receive-a-premier-league-medal|title=Chelsea confirm that Asmir Begović will receive a Premier League medal|first=Gary|last=Cotterill|website=skysports.com|date=15 May 2017|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 30 May 2017, Begović signed for Premier League club Bournemouth on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40098727|title=Asmir Begovic: Bournemouth sign keeper from champions Chelsea|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=30 May 2017|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted for Bournemouth on the opening day of the new Premier League season, in a 0–1 loss against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-centre/west-brom-bournemouth-live-score-10622606|title=WBA 1–0 Bournemouth: Ahmed Hegazi heads in debut winner to down Cherries|website=mirror.co.uk|date=12 August 2017|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begović kept his first clean sheet in the season on 30 September, in a 0–0 draw against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/30/bournemouth-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report|title=Bournemouth stay in bottom three after failing to break down Leicester|website=theguardian.com|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had another impressive performance, this time against his former club Chelsea, which Bournemouth won 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5336545/Chelsea-0-3-Bournemouth-Contes-champions-meltdown.html|title=Chelsea 0–3 Bournemouth: Antonio Conte's champions go into meltdown as Nathan Ake comes back to haunt his former side at Stamford Bridge|website=dailymail.co.uk|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
===Canada===
Begović was the starting goalkeeper for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. He made several difficult saves for his team in a 3–0 loss to [[Chile national under-20 football team|Chile]] and let in one goal against [[Austria national under-19 football team|Austria]]. Late in the third match of the tournament, after allowing two goals, Begović came out of his area to play a long ball from a [[DR Congo national under-20 football team|Congo]] defender. The ball took a high bounce off the wet pitch, forcing him to use his hands to prevent it from going over his head. He was shown a straight red card, and midfielder [[Jonathan Beaulieu-Bourgault]] was forced to play in goal, as Canada had used up its three substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New number one for Canada fans|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/canada2007/news/newsid=549236.html#new+number+canada+fans|publisher=fifa.com|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=4 November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408081919/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u20worldcup/canada2007/news/newsid%3D549236.html|archivedate=8 April 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2007, 20-year-old Begović received his first call-up to the senior Canada squad for the friendly match with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], but didn't see any action on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mitchell and Canada to face Iceland|url=https://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=216145&amp;hubname=soccer|publisher=Canadian Press|date=14 August 2007|accessdate=19 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929164545/http://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=216145&amp;hubname=soccer|archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, he accepted another call for Canada's [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF Third Round|qualifier]] versus Jamaica, but again didn't get any playing time as [[Lars Hirschfeld]] was the preferred option in goal.

Players with dual nationality, like Begović, who had already played for a country's national team at youth level, were not allowed to switch nationalities after they turned 21, but on 3 June 2009 FIFA removed the age limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Simon|title=Soccer-FIFA removes age limit on players switching nations|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/06/03/soccer-fifa-switching-idUKL317735320090603|work=Reuters.com|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2009, he spoke with Bosnian head coach [[Miroslav Blažević]] about the possibility of making his debut for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Quotes in the Bosnian media seemed to indicate Begović's intent to play for the country of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Begović: Ćiro mi je obećao da će me zvati|url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbalp-19424.htm|publisher=SportSport.ba|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=24 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626013453/http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbalp-19424.htm|archivedate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begović missed the [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] for Canada saying Portsmouth wanted him to spend the whole pre-season with the club. On 12 July 2009 on ''[[Full-Time: Vancouver's Soccer Show]]'' on the [[CKST|TEAM 1040]] radio in Canada he indicated his desire to continue with the Canadian national team. He suggested that comments he had made to Bosnia's head coach had been misinterpreted due to poor translation. In the same interview, Begović also said:

{{quote|I've played for Canada for a long time. There's no decision, I don't want to switch... but there is a state of uncertainty with Canada soccer (next coach, etc). Get things in place and I'm happy to stay with Canada, that's where I see my future... I've been approached by Bosnia. There were talks... but I have no intention on playing for Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Begovic: "I don't want to switch"|url=http://fulltimefootballshow.blogspot.com/2009/07/begovic-i-dont-want-to-switch.html|publisher=fulltimefootballshow|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

However, less than two months later, Begović changed his mind and on 21 August 2009 accepted a call-up for two Bosnia [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|2010 World Cup qualifiers]]: away at [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] on 5 September 2009, and four days later versus [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] at home in [[Zenica]]. During the pre-match preparations, Begović gave an interview to the Bosnian web portal, stating among other things:

{{quote|I was born in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina is my homeland and I wouldn't be disappointed even if I don't get a chance to play right away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ako i ne dobijem šansu, neću biti razočaran|url=http://sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/090904063|publisher=sarajevo-x.com|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He did not play in either match. However, his debut for the national team finally came in the next qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]]. He came on to replace [[Kenan Hasagić]] in the 92nd minute of the match, in which Bosnia won the match with a final score of 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/world-cup/2010/estonia-bosnia-herzegovina-249429.html|title=Estonia v Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Yahoo!

On 3 March he played a significant role in a match for the first time as he got to play the second half in Bosnia's [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. Bosnia won the match 2–1 and Begović didn't concede any goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnia-Herzegovina 2–1 Ghana|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2010/03/03/1816436/bosnia-herzegovina-2-1-ghana-dragons-rally-to-defeat-black|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414035448/http://goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2010/03/03/1816436/bosnia-herzegovina-2-1-ghana-dragons-rally-to-defeat-black|archivedate=14 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first full cap against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in May 2010. Bosnia lost the match 4–2, but Begović was not responsible for any of the goals according to the Bosnian media, as they blamed Bosnia's defense for the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/sweden-v-bosnia-and-herzegovina-29-may-2010-289313/|title=Sweden 4–2 Bosnia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caused controversy after he pulled out of Bosnia's friendlies against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9398677.stm|title=Stoke resolve row with Bosnian FA over Asmir Begovic|accessdate=18 February 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224071708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9398677.stm|archivedate=24 February 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since August 2012, Begović has been the first choice goalkeeper for the national team. On 27 May 2013, Begović has been voted the 2012 Bosnian Footballer of the Year by the Bosnian Sport Writers' Jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begović named Bosnian idol|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=bih/news/newsid=1961955.html|publisher=uefa.com|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2013 Bosnia defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 1–0 to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], their first major tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir Begovic: Bosnia goalkeeper plans World Cup upsets|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24574103|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, he was named in Bosnia and Herzegovina's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/bosnia-and-herzegovina/10810419/Bosnia-Herzegovina-World-Cup-2014-squad.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 2014 World Cup Squad|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played full 90 minutes in all 3 matches.

On 18 June 2011, Begović married his American-born wife, Nicolle Howard, with whom he has two daughters, Taylor and Blair Rose Begović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Asmir-Nicolle-Begovic-think-ve-perfect-match/story-13745097-detail/story.html#axzz2ZJtMAyOf|title=Asmir and Nicolle Begovic: 'I think we've found the perfect match'|website=thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|date=8 July 2012|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Stoke-City-star-Asmir-Begovic-takes-time-open-new/story-19259690-detail/story.html#axzz2ZJtMAyOftitle=Stoke City star Asmir Begovic takes time out to open new building at daughter's school|website=thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|date=10 July 2012|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsport.ba/magazin/asmir-begovic-postao-otac/226175|title=Asmir Begović po drugi put postao otac!|publisher=sportsport.ba|date=23 February 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 he joined [[FC Edmonton]]'s charity 'Kicks for Kids Program'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4177305|title=Kicks for Kids Program Gets a Boost From a Soccer Star|website=oursportscentral.com|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begović was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina while it was part of the SFR Yugoslavia, and moved to Germany at the age of four.&lt;ref name="Asmir Begovic: World Cup can reunite Bosnia's golden generation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Steve|title=Asmir Begovic: World Cup can reunite Bosnia's 'golden generation'|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27442963|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=BBC Sports|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in Germany, Begović supported [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and cites goalkeeping great [[Oliver Kahn]] as his inspiration. He also attended matches at his local club [[VfB Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoke City Official Matchday Magazine 24 September 2011 v Manchester United&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his native [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], Begović is fluent in three additional languages: [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scsport.ba/vijest/50496 Begović izabrao: RVP i Mata najbolji u Premiershipu, protiv CR7 bilo je najteže, Kahn najveći...] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013 he set up his own charity, the Asmir Begović Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmir Begovic Foundation|url=http://www.asmirbegovicfoundation.com/|work=ABF|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Anthony Pugh''' (born 2 April 1987) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] of the {{English football updater|HullCity}}, on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. He plays mainly as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] but can also play as a [[midfielder]].

Pugh started his career with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], where he progressed through the youth system. He was released by the club having made his first team while on loan at [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] and signed a short-term contract with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in 2006. Pugh later signed a professional contract at the club and after rejecting an extended contract in 2007 he signed for [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. He was loaned out to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], joining the latter permanently in 2009.

Pugh left Hereford after one season to sign for Bournemouth in 2010, where he was top scorer in his first two seasons. He has since made over 300 appearances for the club, helping them win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Championship in 2013 and the Premier League two years later. As a result, Pugh has played and scored in all five of England's nationwide football divisions.

==Early and personal life==
Pugh was born in [[Bacup]], Lancashire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Barry J. |editor-last=Hugman |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2010–11 |year=2010 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-84596-601-0 |page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Tony and Denise.&lt;ref name="AFC Bournemouth star Marc Pugh: Hat-trick was for my family"/&gt; He grew up in [[Stacksteads]] and attended [[All Saints' Catholic High School, Rawtenstall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making a Marc – footballer Marc Pugh's Free Press diary |url=https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/making-marc---footballer-marc-1706547 |newspaper=Rossendale Free Express |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Laura, with whom he has two daughters.&lt;ref name="AFC Bournemouth star Marc Pugh: Hat-trick was for my family"/&gt; Pugh is a devout Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=Howard |title=Marc Pugh: I've got a great life and I owe it all to God |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14242715.Marc_Pugh__I___ve_got_a_great_life_and_I_owe_it_all_to_God/ |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Burnley===
Pugh started his career with [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003.&lt;ref name="Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster |website=TheFootballNetwork.net |publisher=DA Group |url=http://www.thefootballnetwork.net/main/s37/st85191.htm |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], they decided to keep him on for a third year.&lt;ref name="Marc Pugh goes out to Kidderminster"/&gt; As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Scholes |title=Pugh gets deal |url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/pugh_gets_deal_282980/index.shtml |website=Clarets Mad |publisher=Digital Sports Group |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to him to being [[Loan (sports)|loaned]] out to [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] of the [[Conference National]] in November 2005 to play first team football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidderminster agree deal for Pugh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/k/kidderminster_harriers/4424424.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 3–1 defeat to [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]].&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; He converted a [[Simon Heslop]] [[Cross (football)|cross]] during a match against [[Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C.|Dagenham &amp; Redbridge]] to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidderminster 3–1 Dag &amp; Red |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/4472998.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 December 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on ''[[Soccer AM]]'''s [[Showboat#Showboating|showboating]] section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marc Pugh |url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/QandA/0,,10443~1146115,00.html |publisher=Shrewsbury Town F.C. |date=18 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705214147/http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/QandA/0%2C%2C10443~1146115%2C00.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after picking up a groin injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pugh returns from Harriers spell |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/4523850.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2005 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pugh resumes harriers spell |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~765006,00.html |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=7 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151929/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0%2C%2C10413~765006%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pugh returns from Harriers spell |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/4650330.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 January 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; He learned that he would not receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006, which was partly because both [[Chris McCann]] and [[Kyle Lafferty]] had both already received professional contracts and they were only second year apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youth team news |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~795034,00.html |publisher=Burnley F.C. |date=27 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151944/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0%2C%2C10413~795034%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bury===
Having just been released from Burnley, Pugh signed for [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on a short-term contract on 23 March 2006, following a three-week [[Trial (association football)|trial]].&lt;ref name="Shakers capture midfield quartet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakers capture midfield quartet |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bury/4836832.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shakers sign Pugh |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/715043.Shakers_sign_Pugh/ |newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph |location=Blackburn |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bury were entangled in a [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] battle, and Pugh made his debut two days later after coming on as an 80th-minute substitute in a 2–1 home win over [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bury 2–1 Rochdale |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4819762.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marked his first start for Bury with a goal from 10&amp;nbsp;yards in a 1–1 away draw with [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on 15 April 2006,&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lincoln City 1–1 Bury |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4890980.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Chris Casper]] commented "Mark's a good player and he's got a bright future if he keeps his feet on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Casper pays tribute to Pugh |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casper-pays-tribute-to-pugh-1027072 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 2005–06 season by playing six matches and scoring one goal for the club.&lt;ref name=sb0506/&gt; As a result of his good performances, and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation in 19th place, Bury manager Chris Casper offered him a new one-year contract at [[Gigg Lane]]; his first professional contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three extend at Gigg |url=http://www.buryfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10422~832460,00.html |publisher=Bury F.C. |date=23 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004034112/http://www.buryfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10422~832460%2C00.html |archivedate=4 October 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=League Two: 2005/06: Latest table |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=242 |website=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jermain Colin Defoe''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 7 October 1982) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] of the [[Scottish Premiership]], on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] from {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]], and the [[England national football team|English national team]].

Defoe began his career with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], joining their youth team aged 14, before moving to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] aged 16 and rising through the ranks. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in 2000 and, after a season-long loan spell at Bournemouth during the [[2000–01 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2000–01 season]], established himself in the West Ham line-up. After West Ham's relegation in 2003, a move to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in January 2004 soon followed, where Defoe played for four years before being sold to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in January 2008. He spent one season at [[Fratton Park]] before returning to Tottenham in the January 2009 transfer window. He left for [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) in 2014, before returning to England in January 2015 to sign for Sunderland.

In April 2011, Defoe became the 20th player to score a [[List of Premier League players with 100 or more goals|century of Premier League goals]], and is currently the seventh-highest goalscorer in Premier League history as well as the [[List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. records and statistics#Top 10 all-time scorers|sixth highest goalscorer]] in [[History of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham's history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/8471966/Jermain-Defoe-scores-100th-Premier-League-goal-after-ditching-celebratory-T-shirt.html |title=Jermain Defoe scores 100th Premier League goal after ditching celebratory T-shirt |first=Sandy |last=McCaskill |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THFC number 5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1563238/jermain-defoe-thrilled-tottenham-goals-record?cc=5901 |title=Jermain Defoe thrilled with goals record |publisher=ESPN |first=Kevin |last=Palmer |date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Defoe also holds the Premier League record for the most goals scored as a substitute, with 22, as of 11 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/statuses/422047620912017408 |title=OptaJoe |via=Twitter |publisher=Opta Sports |date=11 January 2014 |quote=22&amp;nbsp;– Jermain Defoe has scored more goals as a Premier League substitute than any other player (22).

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Defoe was spotted playing football by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] who enrolled him at the FA National School of Excellence at [[Lilleshall Hall]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; Two years later, he took the controversial decision, aged 16, to turn professional with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], following which Charlton were subsequently awarded compensation rising to [[Pound sterling|£]]1.4&amp;nbsp;million contingent on Defoe's [[Premier League]] and international appearances.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; At West Ham, he was a member of the Under-19 team that won the [[Premier Academy League]] title in 1999–2000, scoring twice against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the play-off final.&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood"/&gt;

Jermain made his first-team debut in a League Cup match against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in September 2000, scoring in a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walsall 0–1 West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/930913.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, he joined [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[AFC Bournemouth]] on a near season-long [[Loan (sports)|loan]], where he scored in ten consecutive matches, equalling [[John Aldridge]]'s and [[Clarrie Jordan]]'s post-war record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/players_profiles/I-J/JordanC.php |title=Leeds United F.C.

I sent him out to Bournemouth to get some experience playing league football and he's coped marvellously. To score 10 goals in 10 games is a terrific achievement. He's a bright lad who's full of confidence. Nothing knocks him, he's a typical goal-scorer. If he misses, he'll be there the next time looking for a goal. He's a kid with a big future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Redknapp tips Defoe for stardom |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1134216.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe finished as West Ham's top scorer in the 2001–02 season despite being used primarily as a substitute by manager [[Glenn Roeder]],&lt;ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /&gt; scoring 14 goals in 39 league and cup appearances, one of which was a 1–0 away win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in December 2001, as West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe stuns Man Utd |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 December 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1696344.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a further 11 goals in 42 league and cup appearances in 2002–03&lt;ref name=sb0203/&gt; but was unable to prevent West Ham from being relegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham relegated |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2978071.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 24 hours after the club had been relegated, Defoe made a written request for a transfer, saying, "As much as I love West Ham United I feel that now is the right time for me to move on in my career. This is very much a career decision. I am very ambitious and hungry to achieve at the highest levels of the game for both club and country." The timing of his request, however, drew criticism from both fans and teammates and was turned down by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe demands transfer |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3020999.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Ham block Defoe move |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3023583.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologised to supporters, saying, "I mishandled that move and I can only apologise. I'm young and I've learned from it. I still played my hardest for West Ham and gave them 100% and want to thank the fans for their support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe apologises to Hammers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 February 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3453503.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe began 2003–04 with West Ham but a refusal to sign a new contract and disciplinary problems, including three sendings-off, which saw him play only 22 matches out of a possible 34, led to West Ham accepting an offer from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for him in the January transfer window.&lt;ref name=Spurs&gt;{{cite news |title=Spurs sign Defoe |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3452217.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Defoe joined Tottenham in February 2004 for an initial fee of £6&amp;nbsp;million, rising to £7&amp;nbsp;million depending on "specific performance criteria", and with [[Bobby Zamora]] joining West Ham.&lt;ref name=Spurs /&gt; Manager [[David Pleat]] said, "I can't think of a British striker at his age who has achieved as much in such a short space of time.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
[[Steve McClaren]], who took over as England manager after the FIFA World Cup, selected Defoe for England in his first match, a friendly against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England 4–0 Greece |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4794867.stm |accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe continued to be selected and to appear for England in [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] matches and friendly matches.&lt;ref name=englandstats/&gt;

Defoe was initially omitted from [[Fabio Capello]]'s first squad with the new manager insisting he would only select players who were playing regular club football. One day after scoring on his Portsmouth debut, Defoe was recalled to the England squad to replace the injured [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wright-Phillips fit for England |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7225317.stm |accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe took his international goals tally up to five in the Caribbean on 1 June 2008 when he scored twice against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and in the process staking a claim for a more regular place in the international team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jermain Defoe bangs drum for permanent role with deadly double |newspaper=The Times |date=2 June 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/international/article4045972.ece |accessdate=2 June 2008 |location=London |first=Martin |last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe scored his first competitive international goal of 2008 with the final goal in England's 5–1 win over [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] on 11 October 2008 after coming on as a late substitute for Wayne Rooney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7656615.stm |title=England 5–1 Kazakhstan |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored two goals in three minutes against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].&lt;ref name="England 6–0 Andorra"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=England 6–0 Andorra |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8087976.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2009–10 season got off to the perfect start as he came from the bench to score both goals in the 2–2 draw against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]] on 12 August 2009 and was announced as man of the match.&lt;ref name="Netherlands 2–2 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Netherlands 2–2 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8194165.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2010, he scored the only goal in England's third group stage match against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Slovenia 0–1 England"&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Slovenia 0–1 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_37/default.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal gave England the win they needed to progress into the Round of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=264047&amp;cc=5739&amp;ver=global |title=Defoe seals progress |date=23 June 2009 |website=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adil Rami - Jermain Defoe 20120611.jpg|thumb|upright|Defoe (right) playing for England at [[UEFA Euro 2012]]]]

Defoe opened up the scoring for England's [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] campaign against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], volleying home from the six-yard box after a cross from Ashley Cole, whose initial effort was saved by the Bulgarian goalkeeper [[Nikolay Mihaylov]]. Defoe went on to score his first international hat-trick, which was the first ever at the new Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/03/england-bulgaria-euro-2012 |title=Jermain Defoe hat-trick gives England a fresh start |date=3 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 September 2010 |location=London |first=Kevin |last=McCarra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was called up to the England squad to face [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 26 March 2011, though he served as an unused substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9436089.stm |title=Wales 0–2 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was named as a [[UEFA Euro 2012 squads#England|member]] of the England squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Euro 2012 squad: Ruddy, Carroll &amp; Defoe in, Ferdinand out |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18081125 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe did not play for the full 90 minutes in any of his England appearances until 11 September 2012 where he played the entire match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=englandstats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/england-vs-ukraine/teams/253480 |title=England 1–1 Ukraine |publisher=Sky Sports |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe started England's first [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match, a 5–0 away win against [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and scored his 17th goal for England, tying him with [[David Beckham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winter |first=Henry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9529017/Moldova-0-England-5-match-report.html |title=Moldova 0 England 5: match report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/9714280/David-Beckham-would-be-welcome-at-Tottenham-says-Jermain-Defoe.html |title=David Beckham would be welcome at Tottenham, says Jermain Defoe |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe was not included in the [[England world cup squad|23-man squad]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zwolinski |first=Mark |title=Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/tfc/2014/05/16/toronto_fcs_jermain_defoe_vows_to_prove_roy_hodgson_wrong.html |accessdate=17 May 2014 |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe believes that he "likely won't ever get over the decision", and stated, "I don't think I'll ever be at peace with it."&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"/&gt; However, he was named as one of seven players on "standby".&lt;ref name="Toronto FC's Jermain Defoe vows to prove Roy Hodgson wrong"/&gt;

Defoe's form in the 2015–16 season, where he helped Sunderland avoid relegation with 15 goals, led to calls for him to be included in the England squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. He was not, however, named in manager [[Roy Hodgson]]'s 26-man preliminary squad, and expressed his disappointment at his omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dodds |first=Brian |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11695/10284868/jermain-defoe-disappointed-at-england-euro-squad-snub |title=Jermain Defoe disappointed at England Euro squad snub |date=16 May 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
After over three years away from international football, Defoe was recalled to the England squad in March 2017 by manager [[Gareth Southgate]] for a friendly match against Germany and a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39291266 |title=Jermain Defoe: England recall Sunderland striker aged 34 |date=16 March 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March, Defoe returned to the first team, against Lithuania. Ahead of captain, [[Joe Hart]], Defoe led the team onto the pitch with terminally ill child, Bradley Lowery, a Sunderland supporter who suffered from [[neuroblastoma]]. England won the match 2–0 with Defoe scoring the first goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bradley-lowery-jermain-defoe-england-wembley_uk_58d80d63e4b02a2eaab50168 |title=Brilliant Pictures of Bradley Lowery Leading Out England With Jermain Defoe |date=26 March 2017 |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and goal celebrations==
In a 2018 interview with Sky Sports, Defoe spoke about the influence of former Arsenal striker [[Ian Wright]] on his career, which included being inspired by his [[goal celebration]]s. His own favourite celebration is outstretching both arms straight, before stating when scoring a goal "you just want to go mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Defoe's celebrations inspirations |url=https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/11488673/defoes-celebration-inspirations |accessdate=19 October 2018 |agency=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Defoe is a practising [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2348709/A-sinner-or-saint-Defoe-keeps-us-all-guessing.html |title=A sinner or saint, Defoe keeps us all guessing |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has adopted a meat free diet in order to prolong his football career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/jermain-defoe-on-how-a-meat-free-diet-has-taken-his-football-career-to-the-next-level-827824.html |title=Jermain Defoe on how a meat-free diet has taken his football career to the next level |newspaper=Irish Examiner |date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2009, his 26-year-old half-brother, Jade Defoe, died of head injuries following an assault in [[Leytonstone]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8018192.stm |title=Brother of Jermain Defoe killed |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2012, his father, Jimmy Defoe, died after a long battle with throat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jermain Defoe absence following father's death depletes England attack |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/jermain-defoe-absence-following-fathers-death-depletes-england-attack-7827869.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2015 |date=8 June 2012 |first=Sam |last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe was with the England squad ahead of UEFA Euro 2012 at the time, and returned home from Poland upon receiving the news, but rejoined the squad on 9 June, two days before the opening match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Euro&amp;nbsp;– England striker Jermain Defoe back with team after father's death |url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/story/1093589/2012-euro----england-striker-jermain-defoe-back-with-team-after-fathers-death |date=9 June 2012 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played against France as a 77th-minute substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Euro 2012: France 1–1 England |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/18076341 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst playing for Sunderland, Defoe befriended Bradley Lowery, a terminally-ill six-year-old fan with [[neuroblastoma]], describing their relationship as the "highlight of his season".&lt;ref name="BBC 6 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40524081 |title=Jermain Defoe: Bradley Lowery will always be in my heart&amp;nbsp;– Bournemouth striker |date=6 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery was named 'Child of Courage' at the Pride of North East Awards in May 2017; Defoe attended the award ceremony, saying, "As a person he has changed me because of what he's going through at such a young age".&lt;ref name="BBC 19 May 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-tyne-39973584/bradley-lowery-named-child-of-courage-at-award-ceremony |title=Bradley Lowery named Child of Courage at award ceremony |date=19 May 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery died on 7 July 2017, at the age of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39883344 |title=Bradley Lowery: Sunderland fan dies after long illness |date=7 July 2017 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournemouth| Bournemouth]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Avon (county)|Avon]], to former non-league striker Adie Mings, Mings joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2001 as an eight-year-old, but was released in 2009 when the youth budget was axed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/sport/8299798.FOOTBALL__Youngster_Mings_aims_for_England/ | publisher =This Is Wiltshire | accessdate =5 May 2013 | date = 29 July 2010 | title = Football: Youngster Mings aims for England}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Southampton, he attended [[Millfield]] school for two years on a football scholarship. After leaving school, Mings signed for non-league side [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]]. In the summer of 2012, he considered quitting football before eventually signing for his home town team [[Chippenham Town F.C.|Chippenham Town]].&lt;ref name="stuartjames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich|title=Tyrone Mings makes his mark at Ipswich on and off the pitch|author=Stuart James|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ipswich Town===
Mings signed for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2013 after a short trial for a fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]10,000 and an agreement for Ipswich to play a pre-season game against Chippenham.&lt;ref name="stuartjames"/&gt; &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22320506 | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate =4 May 2013 | date = 4 May 2013 | title = Burnley 2–0 Ipswich}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 2013, Mings made his debut for Ipswich on the last day of the [[2012–13 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2012–13 season]] against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He went on into the [[2013–14 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2013–14 season]] starting two more games due to the suspension of [[Aaron Cresswell]]. On 4 January 2014, Mings started an FA Cup tie against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at right back instead of his usual left back role.

Following [[Aaron Cresswell]]'s transfer to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], Mings was handed the number 3 shirt. Because of this, Mings offered to purchase new shirts for two fans who had bought shirts with his old number 15 printed on the back.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On transfer deadline day summer 2014, Mings was subject to a £3&amp;nbsp;million pound bid from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] which was rejected by Ipswich. On 20 September 2014, Mings signed a new three-year contract with Ipswich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29294717|title=BBC Sport – Tyrone Mings: Ipswich Town defender signs new contract|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2014, Mings won the Sky Bet Championship Player of the Month Award for September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/news/article/2014/20141009sepchampionshippotmrp-2007954.aspx|title=Ipswich Town full-back Tyrone Mings named Sky Bet Championship Player of the Month|author=The Football League|work=football-league.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 26 June 2015, Mings signed for newly promoted [[Premier League]] club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be £8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33293441|title=Bournemouth sign defender Tyrone Mings from Ipswich for £8m|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 June 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mings made his Premier League debut for Bournemouth on 29 August 2015 in a 1–1 draw with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

He began his career with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Glenda|editor1-last=Rollin|editor2-first=Jack|editor2-last=Rollin|title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2012–2013|year=2012|publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group|Headline]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7553-6356-8|page=434|edition=43rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the club's youth system at the age of seven.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Turning down offers from other clubs to remain with Charlton,&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; he made his professional debut, and only appearance for the club, on 25 September 2007 in the third round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], away to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He came on as an 86th-minute substitute for [[Svetoslav Todorov]] as Charlton lost 3–1 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luton 3–1 Charlton (aet)|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008011.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was diagnosed with chronic [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]] in his [[Achilles tendon|achilles]] which eventually ruptured, leading to almost a year out of action.&lt;ref name="stuck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the42.ie/harry-arter-ireland-poland-2011405-Mar2015/ |title=Five years ago, Harry Arter was stuck in the Conference.

He later had a loan spell with [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]] as Charlton suffered relegation to [[EFL League One|League One]] and Arter was subsequently released by Parkinson as part of an effort to reduce costs at the club. Arter later expressed his disappointment with the decision, stating "The money I was asking for [...] was nothing. I would have taken anything to stay at the time, so it wasn’t down to finance, it was him (Parkinson) not liking me as a footballer."&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Despite his release, he was allowed to train with Charlton's youth team by coach Steve Avory who had worked with Arter for several years in his youth career.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter later undertook unsuccessful trials with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and even offered to remain with Charlton without pay but was rejected by Parkinson.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt;

===Woking===
On 2 June 2009, Arter joined [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] on a one-year contract along with his former Charlton teammate [[Aswad Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=David|title=New Players|url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1487/new-players/|publisher=[[Woking F.C.]]|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-boardman-happy-kingfield-return-4823711 |title=Boardman happy with Kingfield return |publisher=Surrey Live |last=Youlton |first=Clive |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being recommended by assistant manager [[Jimmy Dack]] who had worked with Arter previously at Welling.&lt;ref name="balls"/&gt; Arter had been waiting for a firm offer to join [[AFC Wimbledon]] but accepted Woking's offer after Wimbledon failed to call back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11697518.AFC_Bournemouth_feature__Harry_Arter_s_rise_from_Conference_South_to_the_top_of_the_Championship/ |title=Harry Arter's rise from Conference South to the top of the Championship |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=1 January 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the club in the opening day of the 2009–10 season, during a 2–1 victory over his former side Welling United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1566/woking-finish-strongly-for-an-opening-win/ |title=Woking finish strongly for an opening win |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2009, Arter scored a [[hat-trick]] for the club during a 5–0 win over [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]] in the [[FA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1724/hat-trick-harry-/ |title=Hat-trick Harry |publisher=Woking F.C. |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2010, Arter joined [[Football League One|League One]] club Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee, later stated as £4,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14899272.AFC_Bournemouth__We_knew_Harry_Arter_was_worth_more_than___4_000_-_we_thought_he_was_worth_closer_to___10_000_/ |title=We knew Harry Arter was worth more than £4,000 - we thought he was worth closer to £10,000! |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Eddie Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfers – June 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8714557.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=League One guide: Bournemouth – Charlton Athletic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8835277.stm|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club had moved to sign Arter after impressing assistant manager [[Jason Tindall]] during a scouting assignment,&lt;ref name="artful"/&gt; with a previous transfer embargo having been recently lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14586002.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-demanding-year-for-ultimate-professional-harry/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: Demanding year for ultimate professional Harry |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, after impressing during the club's preseason fixtures,&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/8332113.cherries-arter-aims-to-put-charlton-disappointment-behind-him/ |title=Arter aims to put Charlton disappointment behind him |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made his debut in their first match of the season, away to his former team Charlton.

====2011–12====
The sales of [[Danny Hollands]] and [[Anton Robinson]] during the 2011 summer transfer window allowed Arter to gain increased first team experience with Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9181634.cherries-star-arters-pledge-i-can-fill-the-midfield-void/ |title=Cherries star Arter's pledge: I can fill the midfield void|newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2011, Arter replaced [[Mark Molesley]] in the 66th minute of a game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Dean Court]], and 17 minutes later confirmed a 2–0 win with his first goal for the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cherries stroll to first win|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/238821/report|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=Sky Sports|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; going on to score in his two following appearances, a 3–1 defeat to [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]] and a 2–1 victory over his former side Carlisle.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt; His performances attracted the attention of several Championship clubs and Bournemouth rejected enquiries from two clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9283535.cherries-arter-focused-only-on-lees-side/ |title=Arter focused only on Lee's side |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Wadley |first=Ian |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before handing him an improved contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9279965.cherries-club-staves-off-championship-interest-in-arter/ |title=Club staves off Championship interest in Arter |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite an upturn in form, Arter suffered from a poor disciplinary record, serving a one-match suspension after collecting five bookings within the first two months of the season and accumulating nine bookings by November. His tally was the worst in League One and led him to seek advice from a sports psychologist in order to control his anger, with the majority of his bookings being due to dissent towards match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9371262.cherries-hot-headed-harry-vows-to-clean-up-act/ |title=Hot-headed Harry vows to clean up act |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually received a two-match ban for receiving his tenth booking of the season a month later and a further three-match ban later in the season for his fifteenth booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9419992.cherries-banned-harry-wary-of-losing-place-in-team/ |title=Banned Harry wary of losing place in team |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9894619.cherries-arter-issues-apology-to-supporters/ |title=Arter issues apology to supporters |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bradbury was dismissed and replaced by former youth team manager [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]], Arter stated that he hoped to be used in a more attacking role after claiming that Bradbury had played him "too defensively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9768112.cherries-arter-relishing-new-attacking-role-after-defensive-claim-over-bradbury/ |title=Arter relishing new attacking role after 'defensive' claim over Bradbury |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he scored 5 goals in 34 league matches during the season as Bournemouth finished in 11th place.&lt;ref name="Games played by Harry Arter in 2011/2012"/&gt;

====2012–13====

On 25 August 2012, in his fourth appearance of the 2012–13 season Arter was sent off after 26 minutes of Bournemouth's 1–1 draw at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for two bookable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preston 1–1 Bournemouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19304261|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the dismissal, he issued a public apology for the sending off and blamed his "immaturity."&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt; Manager Groves held talks with Arter in an attempt to curb his disciplinary problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/9908086.cherries-groves-wants-harry-to-rise-above-red-mist/ |title=Groves wants Harry to rise above red mist |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite accepting his behaviour, Arter also claimed that he was being unfairly treated by referees due to his reputation, commenting "I feel I am being highlighted before a game. [...] I have earned that reputation so it is my fault.

Despite their record finish, Arter was keen to push for promotion at the start of the [[2014–15 Football League Championship|2014–15 season]] and claimed he would see the season as a failure if the club did not at least reach the playoffs.&lt;ref name="push"/&gt; On 25 October 2014, Arter played as Bournemouth beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 8–0 away to set a club record win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29669693 |title=Birmingham City 0–8 Bournemouth|work=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2014 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the season Arter and midfielder [[Andrew Surman]] formed a strong partnership, with Arter more the attacking and Surman the more defensive of the two, with Arter praising his midfield teammate – describing him as "He’s a top player and one we’re fortunate to have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11468907.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-surman-is-perfect-for-our-patient-approach/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: Andrew Surman is perfect for our patient approach |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter was named the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) Player of the Month award for December 2014, after scoring in all five matches he played during the month but lost out to Ipswich Town forward [[Daryl Murphy]] in the Football League equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11720837.afc-bournemouth-cherries-star-harry-arter-wins-pfa-player-of-the-month-award/ |title=Cherries star Harry Arter wins PFA player of the month award |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Mitchell |first=Andy |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rewarded for his form by signing an improved three and a half year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/11731142.afc-bournemouth-arter-targets-fairytale-end-to-cherries-journey/ |title=Harry Arter targets fairytale end to Cherries journey |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter became known for his left footed strikes from range, notably scoring the second goal in the 3–0 home victory over promotion rivals [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and first goal in the 1–1 away draw against second placed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31882584 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 March 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2015, Arter played in the 3–0 home victory against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], the win all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32377069 |title=Bournemouth 3–0 Bolton Wanderers |work=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, he scored the second goal in the 3–0 away win against his former club Charlton, the win fully sealed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match in injury time, the Championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassan |first=Nabil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32459759 |title=Charlton Athletic 0–3 Bournemouth |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into England's top flight in the club's 125-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fchd.info/AFC-BOUR.HTM |title=AFC Bournemouth |publisher=Football Club History Database |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arter was one of Bournemouth's prominent players in the season, contributing 9 goals from 43 matches, and subsequently was voted Supporters' Player of the Season and named PFA Championship Player of the Season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James H |url=http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/2015/05/26/the-promoted-bournemouth/ |title=The Promoted – Bournemouth |publisher=Fantasy Football Scout |date=26 May 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/12975050.afc-bournemouth-arter-crowned-pfa-fans-player-of-the-year-in-the-championship/ |title=Arter crowned PFA fans’ player of the year in the Championship. |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16====

Following the end of their Championship winning season, Arter sustained a groin injury while on international duty that made him a major doubt for the club's opening fixtures in the [[Premier League]]. After being advised to rest for several weeks, Arter was hopeful of returning in time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13327656.afc-bournemouth-arter-vowing-to-be-ready-for-start-of-pre-season/ |title=Arter vowing to be ready for start of pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually forced to undergo surgery on the problem after visiting a specialist in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13712774.afc-bournemouth-arter-takes-first-steps-on-comeback-trail/ |title=Arter takes first steps on comeback trail |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his first team return on 28 October 2015, playing in the club's 1–0 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/13924795.afc-bournemouth-boss-eddie-howe-it-was-like-harry-arter-had-never-been-away/ |title=AFC Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: It was like Harry Arter had never been away |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Premier League debut four days later, on 1 November 2015, as he played 73 minutes in a 2–0 defeat to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Adam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34630316 |title=Southampton 2–0 Bournemouth |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his return was credited with helping the club achieve an upturn in fortunes.&lt;ref name="worst"/&gt;

On 12 December 2015, Arter played in a 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], just days after his wife had given birth to their still born daughter. Despite his grief, he met with manager Howe prior to the match, telling him "I’m training today and playing tomorrow if you want to select me. I want to play so bad."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/29/harry-arter-bournemouth-interview-loss-daughter |title=Harry Arter: ‘Every single game now I go out to play for her' |newspaper=The Guardian |last=James |first=Stuart |date=29 January 2016 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted that he was in a "bad way" mentally before the game and wept in the changing room toilets prior to kick-off.

====Later years====

Prior to the start of the 2016–17 season, Arter signed a new three-year deal with Bournemouth, set to run until 2019, and called on the squad to aim to improve on the previous season and not simply target avoiding relegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14557418.afc-bournemouth-star-arter-more-needed-from-whole-squad-for-premier-boost-not-just-one-or-two/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Arter: More needed from whole squad for Premier boost... not just one or two |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering a 3–1 defeat to Manchester United in the opening game, Arter was sent off in the following match, a 1–0 defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], after receiving a second yellow card for fouling [[Cheikhou Kouyate]]. His first yellow was received for dissent after Premier League officials announced stricter rules on any show of disrespect towards match officials. Despite his sending off, Arter stated "The manager has said if I change the way I play then I become a different player. I just need to cut out those silly bookings chatting back to referees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/14744419.afc-bournemouth-star-harry-arter-i-wont-change-the-way-i-play/ |title=AFC Bournemouth star Harry Arter: I won't change the way I play |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Meldrum |first=Neil |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started Bournemouth's first 21 league games of the season and earned praise for his firm but was dropped from the side for a match against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in January 2017. He stated that he "hated" being left out of the squad but was restored to the starting line-up for the following match, scoring his first goal of the season in a 6–3 defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15099147.afc-bournemouths-harry-arter-i-hated-being-left-out-and-will-give-everything-to-make-sure-it-does-not-happen-again/ |title=AFC Bournemouth's Harry Arter: I hated being left out and will give everything to make sure it does not happen again |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter made 35 appearances for Bournemouth during the 2016–17 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.premierleague.com/players/8050/Harry-Arter/stats?co=1&amp;se=54 |title=Harry Arter statistics |publisher=Premier League |date=28 May 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; being rewarded with a new three-year contract set to run until 2021 at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/national/15410315.harry-arter-agrees-new-four-year-deal-with-bournemouth/ |title=Harry Arter agrees new four-year deal with Bournemouth |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manager Howe praised Arter for improving his disciplinary record, stating that, although he "still had that fiery streak," he had "matured" as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15269113.harry-has-been-able-to-control-his-emotions-a-lot-better-says-howe/ |title=Harry has been able to control his emotions a lot better says Howe |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During pre-season for the 2017–18 season, Arter was monitored by Bournemouth over fitness concerns after playing the majority of the previous season with an achilles injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15360396.arter-will-be-managed-through-pre-season/ |title=Arter will be managed through pre-season |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=21 June 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 2017, Arter received media attention after controversially tricking [[Nathaniel Chalobah]] into leaving a free shot on goal by pretending to be one of Chalobah's teammates in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10999130/harry-arter-should-have-been-booked-for-watford-impersonation-says-dermot-gallagher |title=Harry Arter should have been booked for Watford impersonation, says Dermot Gallagher |publisher=Sky Sports |date=21 August 2017|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having started all of his club's opening five matches, he suffered an injury and after returning to the squad following an international break he was unable to regain his first team place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15622716.much-worse-things-in-life-can-happen-arter-reflects-on-being-dropped-from-premier-league-starting-line-up/ |title='Much worse things in life can happen' – Harry Arter reflects on being dropped from Premier League starting line-up |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Payne |first=Ned |date=26 October 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 13 appearances over the course of the season, his final start coming during a 2–2 draw with [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="hard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/16402063.cherries-midfielder-harry-arter-hopes-hard-graft-will-pay-off/ |title=Cherries midfielder Harry Arter hopes hard graft will pay off |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his lack of playing time, manager Howe stated that Arter was not for sale after he was heavily linked with a transfer to rival Premier League side West Ham United, with Arter declaring he was "100% committed" to Bournemouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/15923738.harry-arter-100-per-cent-committed-to-cherries/ |title=Harry Arter '100 per cent committed' to Cherries |newspaper=Bournemouth Daily Echo |last=Perrett |first=Neil |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiff City (loan)===
Despite stating his desire to remain with Bournemouth in an attempt to force his way back into the first team,&lt;ref name="hard"/&gt; on 9 August 2018, Arter joined newly promoted Premier League side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on loan for the 2018–19 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/harry-arter-cardiff-city-bournemouth-15010649 |title=Cardiff City announce the signing of Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter on season-long loan |publisher=WalesOnline |author=Ian Mitchelmore |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting a similar offer from Watford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.football.london/watford-fc/transfer-news/watford-transfer-cardiff-arter-bournemouth-15010952 |title=Harry Arter rejects Watford approach in favour of move to Cardiff City - reports |website=football.london |last=Spencer |first=Phil |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bournemouth manager Howe admitted that he had taken the decision "reluctantly" as Arter was determined to play first team football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/harry-arter-bournemouth-2-394787 |title=Eddie Howe explains Why Harry Arter Left Bournemouth |website=balls.ie |last=Cooney |first=Gavin |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being ineligible to play against his parent club Bournemouth on the opening day of the season, Arter made his debut for Cardiff in a 0–0 draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 18 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45153217 |title=Cardiff City 0–0 Newcastle United |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=18 August 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early performances for the club earned praise from Cardiff manager [[Neil Warnock]] who described Arter's contribution as "vital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/harry-arter-inspired-shift-behind-15095942 |title=The Harry Arter-inspired shift behind the scenes at Cardiff City that fills Neil Warnock with survival hope |publisher=WalesOnline |last=Booth |first=Dominic |date=1 September 2018 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Arter played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] under-15, [[Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team|under-17]] and [[Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team|under-19]] teams, being eligible through his [[Sligo]]-born grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/bournemouth-s-harry-arter-in-ireland-provisional-squad-for-poland-1.2136697|date=12 March 2015|title=Bournemouth's Harry Arter in Ireland provisional squad for Poland|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Republic of Ireland manager [[Martin O'Neill]] said that Arter was on his radar and could be called up to the squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish/2015/0203/677626-oneill-planning-flexible-approach-to-poland-clash/|publisher=RTÉ|date=4 February 2015|title=Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Harry Arter is on his radar|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first call-up for that game on 12 March, following what O'Neill described as a "very good season",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Ned|title=AFC Bournemouth: Cherries midfielder Harry Arter handed maiden Republic of Ireland call-up|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/cherries/clubnews/11851576.AFC_Bournemouth__Arter_handed_maiden_Republic_of_Ireland_call_up/?ref=mac|accessdate=23 March 2015|newspaper=Bournemouth Echo|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not play in it.

In September 2018, Arter made himself unavailable for selection for two matches after a clash with assistant manager [[Roy Keane]]. After sitting out training on medical advice, Arter was confronted by Keane which led to Arter walking out of the team training session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-harry-arter-ireland-15135664 |title=What Roy Keane allegedly told Harry Arter during bust-up |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |last=Spellmore |first=Damian |date=11 September 2018 |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Arter is the brother-in-law of former England captain [[Scott Parker]], who is married to Arter's sister Carly. They both began their careers at Charlton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AFC Bournemouth: Harry Arter ready for Scott Parker battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30590786|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arter has frequently cited Parker as a positive influence in his life.
